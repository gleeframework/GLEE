"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1000000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800000 for the product. This is a 20% discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of offering $700000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700000 just yet. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750000. This is a 5% discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a new counteroffer. I'm thinking of offering $725000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $725000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $735000. This is a 1% discount from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",735000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $735000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of offering $720000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. What do you think?",720000.0,Bob,6,
