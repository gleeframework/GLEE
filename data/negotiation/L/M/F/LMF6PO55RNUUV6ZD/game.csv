,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's true value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000 as a final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
