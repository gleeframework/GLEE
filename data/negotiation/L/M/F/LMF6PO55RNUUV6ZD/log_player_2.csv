You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's true value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

You can still try to get a better deal.  While Alice has come down in price,  it's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down to $890,000 as a final offer.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you can still try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal entirely."
