"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your business. I've assessed its worth to you at $1,200,000, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value to both of us.  I'm asking for $1,000,000, a price that allows for a substantial profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings.  Let me know your decision at your earliest convenience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). Her message is full of sales tactics (""significant asset"", ""limited-time opportunity""), indicating she's trying to inflate the perceived value. 

You have a strong alternative in John, who will sell it to you at your maximum budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer where she might significantly lower the price to avoid losing the sale."
