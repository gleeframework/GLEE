Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $125 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we do $90?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and it's better to take a guaranteed $100 from John than to potentially haggle with Bob for a slightly higher amount."
