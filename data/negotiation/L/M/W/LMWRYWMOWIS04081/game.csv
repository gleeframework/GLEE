"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $125? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up in price. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested in that price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",120.0,Alice,5,
