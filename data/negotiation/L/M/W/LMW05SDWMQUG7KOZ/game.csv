"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to walk away with a win. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. Considering its value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
