"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make the deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to walk away with a win. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. Considering its value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price but still $1,000 above it.  Bob is risk-averse and doesn't want to risk further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget, avoiding any potential for Alice to counteroffer again and increase the price."
