Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to walk away with a win. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
