"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to sell the product for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
