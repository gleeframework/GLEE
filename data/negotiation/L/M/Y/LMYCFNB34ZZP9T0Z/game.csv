"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while you get a great product.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been very patient with your offers, but $12,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500 as a final offer. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  What's your final decision?",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider it.",12500.0,Bob,8,
