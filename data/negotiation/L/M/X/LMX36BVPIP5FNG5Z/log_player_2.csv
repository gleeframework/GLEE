Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer is lower than my initial asking price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's getting close to where I want to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.
