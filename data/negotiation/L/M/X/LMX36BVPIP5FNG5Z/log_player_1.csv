Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept such a drastic price drop."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer is lower than my initial asking price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still reflects the true value of the product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a higher offer closer to my initial asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to explore if I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal with Bob."
