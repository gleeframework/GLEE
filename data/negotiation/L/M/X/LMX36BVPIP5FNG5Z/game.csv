"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer is lower than my initial asking price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still reflects the true value of the product. Let's find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. It's getting close to where I want to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize the deal.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
