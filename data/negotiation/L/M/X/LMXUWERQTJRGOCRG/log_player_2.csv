# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

The product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $600,000. This is a good deal, but there's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $625000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $625,000 is still a good deal for you, it's worth trying to negotiate further. There is still a gap between Alice's offer and your ideal price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $625,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $575,000?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 575000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $615000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $615,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $615,000

At this point, Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go lower than $615,000.  This is still a great deal for you, saving you $185,000 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a better price."
