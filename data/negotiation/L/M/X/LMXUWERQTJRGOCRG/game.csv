"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $600000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $550000?",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $625000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $575000?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",575000.0,Bob,4,
