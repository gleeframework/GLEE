{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1.2 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, as it's well above your stated value of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,100,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer is still a good deal for you, as it's well below the value you've placed on the product.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
