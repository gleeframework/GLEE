Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price close to your minimum but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 gives you leverage.
* **Psychology:** A price slightly below $12,000 might seem like a ""deal"" to Bob compared to your guaranteed offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies you're flexible, potentially leading to a quicker sale. 

**It's important to note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject this offer, but the potential for earning an extra $1,999 makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
