"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $17,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $17,500 is a good starting point because it allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching a potential compromise.
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,500 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $15,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of this price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  $15,000 is still my minimum acceptable price, and I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiating further:**  I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. I believe there's still room for compromise, and I want to see if I can get him closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer as a fallback:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, which provides me with a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,500 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This is a significant compromise on my part. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:**  While I'm still above Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to meet him halfway by lowering my price to $13,500.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I emphasize that this is a significant compromise on my part, putting pressure on Bob to accept the offer.
* **Setting a firm line:**  $13,500 is my final concession. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and further rounds are unlikely to yield a better price from Bob.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price or a failed deal. 

It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid potential losses by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
