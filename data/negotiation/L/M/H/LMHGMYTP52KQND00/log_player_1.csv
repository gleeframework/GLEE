{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives Bob room to counteroffer while leaving space for me to potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $950,000, it's significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's closer to Bob's offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's likely I won't get a better offer from him, and selling to John would only net me $1,200,000.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
