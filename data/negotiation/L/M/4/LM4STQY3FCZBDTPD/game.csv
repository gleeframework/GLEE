"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go to $10,600. This is my final offer, as I can get the product for $10,000 elsewhere. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,600. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you $10,700. This is my best price, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",10700.0,Alice,5,
