Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($12,000) than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob is firm on his initial offer, there is still room for negotiation.  I believe I can potentially get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage in the negotiations. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  $9,500 is a compromise between Bob's offer and my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to undervalue the product.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm highlighting the value for both of us - a ""great price"" for Bob and a ""fair profit"" for me.
* **Open to further discussion:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage further negotiation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $9,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $9,000 is only $3,000 below my minimum value of $12,000. It's a significant loss, but it's still a substantial profit.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting Bob's offer might open up the possibility of future deals with him, potentially leading to higher prices in the future.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might consume more time and effort without a guarantee of a significantly better outcome. 

While I would prefer to sell for closer to my minimum value, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most practical option at this point."
