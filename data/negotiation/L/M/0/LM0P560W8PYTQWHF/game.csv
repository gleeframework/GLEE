"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a good price for a product worth $8,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,500. How about we try $7,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is still a bit too low. Let's compromise at $8,200. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7,900? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7900.0,Bob,6,
