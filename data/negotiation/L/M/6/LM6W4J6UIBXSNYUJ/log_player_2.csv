"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's still potential to save more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial goal, and significantly lower than John's price.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $125,000, which is a substantial amount.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings might not be worth the effort and risk of losing the deal entirely."
