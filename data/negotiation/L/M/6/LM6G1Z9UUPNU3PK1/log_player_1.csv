"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I believe this is a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  This offer is a compromise and signals I'm serious about closing a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'm getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise and only $50,000 above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I still need to make a profit.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to close the deal soon."
