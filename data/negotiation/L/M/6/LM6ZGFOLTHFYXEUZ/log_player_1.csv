"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a relatively high price, but not unreasonable, and it allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to the $120 value as possible without losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target of $120. I'll see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $100.  How about $95?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to counter with $93 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $93 is tempting, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $100. We're in the middle of the negotiation, so there's still room for a little more back and forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think $94 is a good compromise. It's fair for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 94} 
```"
