"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's potential to save a lot of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above my target price. I want to see if Alice is willing to budge, and this offer shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for 850000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise. While I was hoping for a price closer to $800,000, $850,000 is still a significant savings compared to both my initial budget and John's offer.  It's better to take advantage of this deal than risk losing it by continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
