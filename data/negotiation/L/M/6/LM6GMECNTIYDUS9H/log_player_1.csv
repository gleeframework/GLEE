Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $11,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $11,000. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  Would you consider $10,800? That's a firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,800 is a good deal, considering the limited rounds left. I'm confident I can still make a profit, and it's better than settling for John's offer of $10,000."
