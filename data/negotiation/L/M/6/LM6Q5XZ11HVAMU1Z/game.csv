"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. Can you consider $10,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,800 is close, but I need to get at least $10,900 for this to make sense.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations at this price.",10900.0,Alice,5,
