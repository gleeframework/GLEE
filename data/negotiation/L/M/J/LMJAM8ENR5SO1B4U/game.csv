"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,300,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to get a fair return on my product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
