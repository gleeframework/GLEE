"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm asking for $110 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it positively and expressing confidence that Bob will find the product valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob, or at least hold out for John's offer if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $85 and end the negotiation, it's still below my minimum value. I have time to continue negotiating with Bob, and if it doesn't work out, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $85 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $90.  Let's close this deal, I think we're both very close to a fair price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $82 is still below my minimum value of $100, and we've been going back and forth for a while now.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's offer, which is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement."
