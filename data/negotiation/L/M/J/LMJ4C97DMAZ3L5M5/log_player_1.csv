Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $119, you're aiming to maximize your profit while staying below Bob's maximum valuation. This gives Bob a small incentive to buy from you ($1 savings) while ensuring you make a significant profit if he accepts. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still fall back on John's offer."
