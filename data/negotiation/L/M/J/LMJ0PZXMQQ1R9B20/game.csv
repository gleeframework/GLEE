"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its industry and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is slightly above my minimum, but I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go as low as $950000. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my last concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000. Can we do $990000?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $990000, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much. I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final push, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm counteroffering at $1015000. This is my absolute final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1015000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go as low as $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,10,
