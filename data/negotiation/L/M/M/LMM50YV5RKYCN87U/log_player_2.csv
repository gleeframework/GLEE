**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since I'm trying to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $8,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise, getting me closer to my target price of $8,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it saves me $2,500 compared to buying from John."
