"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept. Let's try $1,100,000 again. This price is still lower than my initial offer, and it reflects the value of the product. I'm eager to make this deal work.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,062,500? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
