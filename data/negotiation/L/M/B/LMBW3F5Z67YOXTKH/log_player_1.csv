{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. Bob values the product at $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for me. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""initial proposal,"" I subtly imply the price might not be negotiable for long, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of closing a deal with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
