Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and trying to gauge Bob's interest.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll start by rejecting his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm trying to split the difference between my minimum and Bob's offer, while also emphasizing that I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's see if this gets us closer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick to my original budget. I am still interested in purchasing the product for $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $100. I'm not confident I can get him any higher, and John is willing to pay my minimum. So I'll sell to John and avoid any further negotiation."
