# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  Bob can try to get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is a good price, saving him $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
