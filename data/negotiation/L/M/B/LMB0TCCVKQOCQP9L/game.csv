"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
