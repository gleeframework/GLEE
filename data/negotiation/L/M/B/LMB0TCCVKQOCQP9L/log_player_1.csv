Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've expressed interest in. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended.  I want Bob to feel like he has some control in the negotiation, which could lead to a more positive outcome.

**Why this is a good starting point:**

* **Not too aggressive:** $130 is not too far off from Bob's value, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  I can lower the price if necessary, or accept a counteroffer.
* **Keeps John in the back of my mind:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I still have the option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $60 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150, and it's also below what I'm willing to accept for the product. 
* **I have a better option with John.** I can sell to John for $150, which is much closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Although Bob's offer is too low, I can use this opportunity to negotiate with him.  I'll make a counteroffer that's still profitable for me but might be more appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to go down to $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $100, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $60.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reasoning:**  $100 is still above my minimum value and allows for some profit.  It's also a reasonable compromise that might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $100, I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further.  If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a better price.  If he rejects, I can either accept his next counteroffer (if it's closer to my desired price) or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $60 is too low, Alice.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  $75 is below my minimum value of $150. While it's an improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough for me to consider selling at that price.
* **John remains a better option.**  I can still sell to John for $150, which is a significantly better deal for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  Although Bob's offer is too low, I can use this opportunity to negotiate with him further. I'll try to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap, but I'm prepared to walk away if he's unwilling to meet my minimum requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! $75 is still below my minimum, but I want to find a solution. Let's try $90. I think this is a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $90, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $75.
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence in negotiation while also reiterating that $90 is my minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  $90 is a bit closer to my minimum value and still offers a decent profit. It's also a reasonable compromise that might be more appealing to Bob.

**Strategy:**

By offering $90, I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price. If he accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $150.  If I have time, I could negotiate a few more rounds. However, I need to be prepared to cut my losses and sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet my minimum price."
