"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,350,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm confident that this product is a valuable asset, but I'm only able to offer $1,250,000 at this time. This price represents a significant investment on my part and reflects the true value I see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand that this is a significant investment for you, and I respect your valuation of the product. After careful consideration, I am willing to adjust the price to $1,300,000. This still reflects a premium over the product's intrinsic value to us, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with this transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a significant investment for me and reflects the true value I see in this product.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
