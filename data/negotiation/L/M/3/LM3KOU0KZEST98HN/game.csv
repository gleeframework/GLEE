"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $8,500. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",8000.0,Alice,5,
