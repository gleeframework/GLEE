Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and a ""fair price,"" you subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While you don't explicitly mention John, implying you have other options creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and start a dialogue.

**Important Note:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher gives you the chance to maximize your profit. Bob might be willing to pay more than $15,000, especially if he perceives the product as valuable and scarce."
