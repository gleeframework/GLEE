Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $92.50. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

$92.50 is still above my limit of $80.  I'll try to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering the product to you for $90. Let's see if we can meet in the middle now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my limit, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk going back and forth any further. It's better to just buy from John for $80 and be done with it."
