,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $92.50. Let me know if that works for you.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm offering the product to you for $90. Let's see if we can meet in the middle now.",90.0,Alice,5,
