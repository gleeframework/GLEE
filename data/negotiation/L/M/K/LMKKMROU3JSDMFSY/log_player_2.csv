"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $120, and Alice's initial offer is $100, it's reasonable to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good value for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
