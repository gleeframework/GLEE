"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good value for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
