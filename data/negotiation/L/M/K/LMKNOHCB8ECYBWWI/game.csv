"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize the value you see in the product, $950,000 falls quite a bit short of what I believe it's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
