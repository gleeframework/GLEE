Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation room if Bob tries to haggle.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This means any offer above $1,000,000 is profitable.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
