"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $250. Is this something you'd be interested in?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $250 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $100?  That's the absolute maximum I'm able to spend on this.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $175 for the product. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. How about $125?  I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $150, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $125.  If you're not able to accept that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
