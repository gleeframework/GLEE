"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original prices. How about we try $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $850,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
