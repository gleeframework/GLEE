"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a one-time deal. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 saves you $30 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, the difference between her price and your maximum value ($150) means you're still getting a good deal."
