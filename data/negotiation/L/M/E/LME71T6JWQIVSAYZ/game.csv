"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential return on investment for someone like you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,500,000. At this price, you're still getting an incredible deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,500,000 is still too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  That's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
