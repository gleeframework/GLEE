"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $12,000, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still above my budget. My final offer is $13,000. I'm serious about buying this product, but I simply can't afford more. This price is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $13000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $14500 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than before, it's still above his budget.  It's better to stick with his original plan to buy from John for $12,000.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further, but at this point, he's already made a significant concession and should stick with his decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above my budget. My final offer remains $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if you agree. If you're not willing to accept my offer, I'll need to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 13000}
