"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with an initial offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This shows a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I respect that. However,  $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  This is a significant reduction from my original offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're eager to close this deal, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, I need to ensure I'm receiving a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000.  This is a fair and reasonable price, and I believe it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this agreement now.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works best for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it allows us to close this deal while still reflecting the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this agreement.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
