Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We still have plenty of room to negotiate, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than our desired outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I acknowledge your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,850,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. It's worth another counteroffer to try and push closer to $1,900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,875,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice, but I'm still not ready to commit to $1,875,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,825,000. Can you meet me there?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to our acceptable range. However, his counteroffer is a significant jump back down. We need to hold firm to demonstrate the product's value and our willingness to walk away if we don't get a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but that offer is a significant step back from our previous discussions.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,820,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. He's consistently undervaluing the product and unwilling to budge beyond a certain point.  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It's not worth the risk of continuing with Bob and potentially getting even less, or having the deal fall through entirely."
