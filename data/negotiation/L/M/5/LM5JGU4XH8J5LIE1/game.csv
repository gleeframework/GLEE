"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a price that I believe is a fair reflection of its value. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $900,000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're willing to pay, while still reflecting the product's value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,150,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're still interested, let's make a deal!",1150000.0,Alice,5,,
