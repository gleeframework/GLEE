"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that this product holds a significant importance to me. However, I understand its true worth might resonate differently based on your needs. Considering the high value I place on it, I'm offering you the chance to own it for $10,000. This price reflects a balance between acknowledging its true value to me and offering you a competitive deal. I believe this is an excellent opportunity for both of us, ensuring you get a valuable asset at a reasonable price while allowing me to maintain its significance. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
