"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While I value the product at $1,200,000, I'm hoping to get a much higher price.  This initial offer sets the stage for a potential compromise. 
* **Testing the waters:**  I want to see how Bob reacts to this price. If he rejects it, I'll have a better idea of his valuation and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $1,400,000 is better than my minimum, it's still not the price I'm hoping for. 
* **Negotiation is key:** I want to try and get a price closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I still have options to consider. If the negotiations don't go well, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **Testing the waters again:** I want to see if this counteroffer is acceptable to Bob. If not, I'll need to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Minimum value reached:** Bob's offer is now at my minimum value of $1,200,000. There is no more room for negotiation to increase the price.
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to achieve a better price.
* **Secure the deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a higher price."
