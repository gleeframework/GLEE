Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows a willingness to compromise, making it more likely Bob will accept or at least counter with a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $82.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's a nice product Alice, but I have a strict budget.  Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation and Bob seems unwilling to go much higher. To avoid further haggling and ensure I get a decent price, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
