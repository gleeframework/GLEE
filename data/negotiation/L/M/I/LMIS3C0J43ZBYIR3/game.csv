"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers, and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, to make this work for me, I need to see the price closer to $2,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that point?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
