"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting high shows confidence in the product's value and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Aiming for $2,250,000 (150% of your minimum) allows for potential compromises while staying well above your baseline. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's benefits and suggesting a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers, and allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is above our absolute minimum, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. We're in early rounds, and selling to John for $1,500,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, to make this work for me, I need to see the price closer to $2,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that point?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We've lowered our ask significantly from $2,250,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm on Value:** $2,000,000 is still a strong price, representing a substantial gain from our minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer tests Bob's flexibility. A significant gap remains, which may prompt a more serious response or reveal his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,800,000 is a significant profit margin above our $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a genuine interest in closing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  We're approaching the halfway point in negotiations. Accepting now secures the profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us having to settle for John's price later."
