"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $150? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
