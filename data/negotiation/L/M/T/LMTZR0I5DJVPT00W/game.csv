"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $975000, which is $1015000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any further. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,9,
