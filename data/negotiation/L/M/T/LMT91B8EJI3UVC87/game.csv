"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $125? I'm really interested in the product, and that's the most I can do right now.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $130.  Let's meet in the middle. If you're willing to drop to $130, I'll buy it right away.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to drop the price to $132.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",132.5,Alice,5,
