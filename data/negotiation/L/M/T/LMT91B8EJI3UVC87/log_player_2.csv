"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($120), so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $125? I'm really interested in the product, and that's the most I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target of $125.  I'll counteroffer again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $130.  Let's meet in the middle. If you're willing to drop to $130, I'll buy it right away."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to drop the price to $132.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $132.50, which is only $2.50 more than my ideal price of $130.  While I'd prefer to get it for $130,  it's getting close to my maximum budget, and further negotiation might not be worth the effort. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of her increasing the price again or me having to buy from John at $150."
