"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  The counteroffer strategy allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum price point of $10,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price.  A slightly higher offer than his target might make Alice more likely to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $11,500, which is within Bob's budget. It's a good deal considering Bob's initial offer was rejected. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to sell or that Bob might end up paying more by going back and forth. Accepting this offer secures a good price within his budget and avoids the potential risks of continued negotiation."
