Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. It's a great deal you don't want to miss!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob.  It's a price that's likely to be tempting while still netting you a profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
