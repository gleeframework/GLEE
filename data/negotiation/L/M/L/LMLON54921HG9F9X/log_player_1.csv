Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high demand and value by mentioning ""interest"" and not listing it publicly yet. This creates a sense of scarcity and justifies the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it doesn't completely shut down the conversation. Bob might try to negotiate, giving you a chance to lower the price slightly while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
