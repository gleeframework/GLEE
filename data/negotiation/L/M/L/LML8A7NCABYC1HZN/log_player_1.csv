Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to make even more profit.
* **Appeal to Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures you're aiming higher than his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher sale price."
