,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $19500. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're interested.",19500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $19500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17500?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $17500 is getting closer to a sweet spot for both of us. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $18250. This is my final concession for now, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway.",18250.0,Alice,5,
