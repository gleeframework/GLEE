"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $100. This is a good price, but you can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can counteroffer at a lower price and try to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $105 is still within your budget and is a reasonable price.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $120.  There's a chance you could negotiate further and get a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
