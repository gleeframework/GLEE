Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option with John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $50,000."
