"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to get for this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still gives you a considerable profit margin, and it allows me to achieve a fair price for my investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $900,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1,000,000. This price is still well within your budget, and it allows me to secure a more reasonable return on my investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $930,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal soon.",930000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to close this deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  I'm willing to come down to $970,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows me to reach a fair outcome. Let's finalize this agreement.",970000.0,Alice,7,
