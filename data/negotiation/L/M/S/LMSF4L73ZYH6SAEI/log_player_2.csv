"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $100 to me, but considering its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement. I'm offering it to you for $120. This price reflects the product's quality and the fact that it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if this works for you, or if you'd like to discuss other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly cheaper than buying from John for $150.  It makes sense to accept this offer."
