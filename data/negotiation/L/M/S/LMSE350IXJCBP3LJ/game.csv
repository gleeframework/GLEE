,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about we start at $110? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,125.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we aim for $122.50?",122.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your position, but $122.5 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $116.25. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",116.25,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not ready to go as low as $116.25. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this amazing product. How about we meet at $128?",128.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your desire to get a fair price, but $128 is still outside my budget. Let's try $118. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both of our needs.",118.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,135.0
"I'm not willing to go as low as $118, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at this point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we aim for $131.50?",131.5,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $131.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $121.  This would be a significant savings for you and a good deal for me. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",121.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,140.0
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $121, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $136?",136.0,Alice,9,,
