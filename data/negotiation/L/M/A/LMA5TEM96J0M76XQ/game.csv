"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000, which still gives you a great deal on a product you value at $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
