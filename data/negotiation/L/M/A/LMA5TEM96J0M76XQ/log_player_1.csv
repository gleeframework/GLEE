Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired goal while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm staying well above my minimum of $12,000 to ensure I don't end up selling to John at a loss. 
* **Positive and encouraging:**  My message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While this is a good deal for Bob, it's not a good deal for me. It means I would make no profit from this transaction. 
* **Potential for better offer:**  I believe Bob is still interested in the product and might be willing to pay more. He acknowledged that he was ""thinking more along the lines of $12,000"" which suggests he might be willing to negotiate.
* **No risk in rejecting:**  If I reject his offer and he walks away, I can always sell to John for $12,000, which ensures I don't lose money. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000, which still gives you a great deal on a product you value at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the value he places on the product ($15,000) to further highlight the good deal he's getting.
* **Maintaining profit margin:** $13,000 is still above my minimum, so I'll be making a profit while also showing flexibility to Bob.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable deal:** While not my ideal price, $12,500 is still above my minimum of $12,000, meaning I'll make a profit.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob is at his limit,  he showed willingness to meet halfway, which indicates he might be willing to budge a bit more.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject his offer and he walks away, I can only sell to John for $12,000. This means accepting his offer is a safer choice.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable transaction with a good chance of a future negotiation to increase the price further."
