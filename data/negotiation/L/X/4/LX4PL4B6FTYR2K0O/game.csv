"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price is still fair, but also demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really hoping we can close this deal. While $1250000 is closer to my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1300000. This compromise shows my commitment to a mutually beneficial outcome.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1200000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without overpaying.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
