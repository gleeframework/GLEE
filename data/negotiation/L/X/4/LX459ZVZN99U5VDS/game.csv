,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $108.  If we can agree on that, I'll take it off your hands.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  I'm willing to make this final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
