Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows for some negotiation room and gives me the best chance of getting a good price. I'm also considering that if Bob rejects this offer, I can always go with John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this price and agree to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than John's offer.  At this point, it's a good deal for me, and the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential loss of profit.  I'm accepting Bob's offer and closing the deal."
