"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I also want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this will be a sweet spot and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try for more, we're already in round 4 and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best option for me right now."
