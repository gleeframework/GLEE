"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for a price that reflects its potential value to you, but is also fair to me. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This price allows you a significant profit while still ensuring a good return for me. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
