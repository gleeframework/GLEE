Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but would like to offer $85. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $100. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You still want to save more money. $100 is closer to your limit but John offers a better price. You can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $90.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  Let me know."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $95. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so if you're interested, let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $95, which is only $5 less than John's price.  It's getting closer to your goal, but you've already spent 4 rounds trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.  It's not guaranteed that you can get a better deal with Alice, and you could end up wasting more rounds. 

At this point, it's best to go with John's offer and secure the product at a price that fits your budget."
