"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $850000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $800000, which is the bare minimum I can accept. It's a fair compromise and gives you a good deal. Let's finalize this, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
