{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by expressing openness to his input."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. To avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing the sale, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $130."
