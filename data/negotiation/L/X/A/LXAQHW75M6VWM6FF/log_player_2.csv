"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $115 to $110, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $105. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying $120 to John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget and avoids potential complications."
