Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification for Price:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value tailored to Bob's ""insights"" might justify the higher price in his mind. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiating style, you might adjust the price and message accordingly."
