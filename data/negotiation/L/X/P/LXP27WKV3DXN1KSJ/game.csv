"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $125. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider a price of $115 for the product. This still allows for a fair profit while being reasonable for you. I hope this proposal works for you.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $112. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's get this done.",112.0,Bob,6,
