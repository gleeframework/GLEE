Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going all-in with my first offer, allowing for potential counteroffers.  
* **The John Factor:**  The knowledge that I have a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage to hold firm on my price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* If negotiations become too difficult or time-consuming, I have the option to walk away and sell to John, securing my minimum desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to earn. 
* **I have leverage.** I know John is willing to pay $1,500,000, giving me a strong position in negotiations.
* **Counteroffers are possible.** I can make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my ideal price, potentially leading to a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's higher than his offer but still within the range of a potential deal. 
* I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement with Bob. 
* If negotiations stall or Bob becomes unreasonable, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum desired profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'll accept $1,050,000 for the product.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Range:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob and highlighting that this price still benefits him.
* **Finality:** I'm stating this is my final price point, creating pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **John as Backup:** The knowledge of John's offer provides me with confidence to stand firm on my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price and closed the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess my options:
    * **Lower Offer:** I can lower my price slightly, but I don't want to go too low.
    * **End Negotiation:**  If Bob is unwilling to compromise, I can sell to John.
* I'll need to monitor Bob's reaction and adapt my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept.
* **I'm close to my minimum price.**  I'm hesitant to drop much further as selling to John would net me a much higher profit.
* **I can still negotiate.** I'm confident I can secure a better price with another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a final counteroffer. It will be slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer, aiming for a compromise.
*  I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925000. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept, especially considering my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiations are stalled.** Bob's persistent refusal to move closer to my price point suggests that further negotiations are unlikely to be successful.
* **John is a better option.**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, which is significantly higher than what Bob is offering.

**Conclusion:**

I've reached a point where further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to yield a favorable outcome. To maximize my profits, I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $1,500,000."
