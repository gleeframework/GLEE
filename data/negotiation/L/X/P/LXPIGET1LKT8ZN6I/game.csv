,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $95? That would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
