,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both recognize in this item. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Given the value and uniqueness of [product description], I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1750000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1250000, which I believe represents a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm confident this offer is mutually beneficial, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget limitations, $1250000 is still significantly below what I can accept. Given the unique value and potential of [product description], I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find a mutually acceptable solution.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're getting closer to a deal, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go as high as $1350000, which I believe reflects the value we both recognize in this product. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still unable to accept. Given the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1425000. This is my final counteroffer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to reconsider our negotiations.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1425000 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to offer $1375000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and my financial constraints.  If this offer isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore alternative options.",1375000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I've been willing to negotiate throughout this process.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is my final offer, and it's a price that I believe reflects the product's value while also being within your budget.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move forward with another buyer who's ready to close the deal at my minimum price.",1400000.0,Alice,9,
