"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible, but I also want to keep the deal open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can get it elsewhere for $100. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
I'm lowering the price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to stick to my original budget. Could we perhaps agree on $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I want to see if we can get to a mutually acceptable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $112? It's a fair compromise that will allow us both to get what we need."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to my target price of $120, but still acceptable to Bob. By offering $112, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to meet him halfway. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're still discussing this. I'd like to stay within my budget of $100. Would $110 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is finally within my minimum acceptable price range of $120. While I would love to get closer to my ideal price, accepting this offer will secure me a profit. I'm confident this is the best option to maximize my earnings while still closing the deal."
