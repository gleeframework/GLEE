"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price that allows you to save $2,000, while still giving me a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested, and we can finalize the details.",10000.0,Alice,1,
