Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum.** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value.** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation.
* **It's a strong opening offer.** This sets the tone for a serious negotiation. 

It's important to be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, I am only willing to pay $900,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to counter with $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,000,000 is still a good profit for me and is close to my desired outcome.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and ending up selling to John at a much lower price."
