{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently shown a willingness to compromise, and $11,250 is a good price. You're still well within your budget, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
