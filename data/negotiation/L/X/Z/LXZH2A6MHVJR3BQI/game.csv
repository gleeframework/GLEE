"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, the price point is too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  To be candid, $900,000 is still a stretch for me.  I could make a deal work around $700,000. That would be a fair compromise for both of us, wouldn't you agree?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that. I'm ready to make this deal happen. Would you consider $780,000? That's a serious offer, and I think it would be beneficial for us both to close this out.",780000.0,Bob,6,
