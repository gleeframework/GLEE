"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I was thinking we could even go a bit higher to make it worth my while. How about $11200? I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value",11200.0,Alice,5,
