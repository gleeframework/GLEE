{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $180 is far above your maximum budget of $120.  It's worth rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $120. I'm still willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $165 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While we're getting closer to a deal, the negotiation is taking a long time. I've already used up 4 rounds.  It's now time to take the guaranteed deal from John at $120."
