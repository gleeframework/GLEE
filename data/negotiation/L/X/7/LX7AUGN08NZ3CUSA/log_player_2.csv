"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. Let's make this deal happen! How about we start with a price of $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $80 to me, I want to pay less. Alice's initial offer of $75 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject her offer and counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $80 for me, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $70 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay $70 for the product. To find a middle ground, how about I offer you the product for $72? This still allows us to stay within your budget while providing a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $72 is close to my counteroffer of $70. This is a good deal for me as it's within my budget of $80 and saves me $8. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
