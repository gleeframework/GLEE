Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it will be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Gauging Interest:** A high initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, you can always lower the price. If he counters, you know he's serious.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $10,000. This gives you leverage as you don't *need* to sell to Bob for less than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
