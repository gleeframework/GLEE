"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $120, I want to start with a significantly lower offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $80, I signal that I'm serious about buying but expect Alice to come down on her price.  This leaves space for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message aims to be polite and respectful while clearly stating my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $140 is closer to my limit but still above what I'm willing to pay. I have room to negotiate further.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see how much lower Alice is willing to go.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm looking for a more significant price reduction. 
* **John is an Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $120 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $140 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy at that amount."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  I've increased my offer to $100, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""I'm ready to buy at that amount,"" I'm adding a bit of urgency and indicating this is a serious offer.
* **Balancing Act:**  I'm still below my maximum budget, allowing for further negotiation if needed, but getting closer to a potentially acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, I can't let it go for less than $120. That's my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached My Limit:** Alice's offer of $120 matches my maximum budget. 
* **No Point in Haggling:** Trying to negotiate further is unlikely to yield any savings, as Alice has stated this is her bottom line.
* **Equal to John's Price:**  Since I can buy from John for the same price, I might as well accept Alice's offer and avoid any potential delays or complications from going with another seller."
