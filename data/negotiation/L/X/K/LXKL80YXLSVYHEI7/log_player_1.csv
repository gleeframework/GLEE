Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation tactics to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you come down later. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will give you valuable information for the rest of the negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the initial offer."
