Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $13,000 to make this work.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,500.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
