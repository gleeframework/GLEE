"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a risky strategy, but it allows for potential negotiation and maximizing my profits. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds.  If the negotiations fail, I have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,000. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I believe I can still get a better deal through negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially gets us closer to a deal.  I'm hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it.  I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation. There are still six rounds left, which gives me time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally agree to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. 

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm concerned that we might be stuck in a stalemate.  With only four rounds remaining, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement. 

Selling to John guarantees me a profit and allows me to move on. It's a safe and secure option."
