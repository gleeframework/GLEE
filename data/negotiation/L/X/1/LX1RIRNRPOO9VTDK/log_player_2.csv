Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good price for the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to go as low as $13,500. This is my final offer. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll be selling the product to someone else.

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500. While getting the product for a slightly lower price with Alice might be possible, it's not worth the risk of her selling it to someone else.  John offers a sure thing at your target price."
