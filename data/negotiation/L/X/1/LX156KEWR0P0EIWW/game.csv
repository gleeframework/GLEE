"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still gives you a significant discount from its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
