{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth more than $12,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000.  This is a good compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm still hoping to get a good price for the product, but I'm also showing that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to drop to $10,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
