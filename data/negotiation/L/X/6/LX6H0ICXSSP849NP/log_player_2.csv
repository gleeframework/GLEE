**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup if negotiations fail."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and is closer to my value. Let me know your thoughts.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than you are willing to pay.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth continuing to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. You can always buy from John as a backup."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000. This price is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  While it's closer than before, it's not a price I'm willing to pay.  It's time to stop negotiating and take advantage of the guaranteed deal with John at $800,000."
