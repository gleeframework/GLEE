"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your desired value. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and is closer to my value. Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price is a significant improvement from my previous offer and still allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is still too far below my minimum price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000. This price is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
