Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand.  It's unlikely she'll go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option for $800,000 with John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
