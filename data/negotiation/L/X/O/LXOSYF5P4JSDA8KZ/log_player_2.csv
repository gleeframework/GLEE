"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

This is a starting point, a reasonable offer that shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.  We'll see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $110 is closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to pay more than $100.  It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm increasing my offer a bit, showing flexibility, but still keeping it below my limit. This is a good middle ground to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to my price, I'm still not willing to pay $105.  It's worth trying to negotiate just a little more.  If it doesn't work, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay the same price as John, but I'd rather get it from Alice if she's willing to meet me here."
