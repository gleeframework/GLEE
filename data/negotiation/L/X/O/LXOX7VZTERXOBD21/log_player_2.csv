"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $130.  I think you'll find it's a real steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet Alice somewhere in the middle of the starting prices. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room to potentially go lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we split the difference and settle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, there's still room for negotiation. We'll counter-offer again, edging closer to her value but staying below our maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we make it $105 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving while staying firm but fair. It depends on whether Alice is willing to go lower or if she values closing the deal quickly."
