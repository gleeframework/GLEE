"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet halfway.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $11,150.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. ",11150.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget. I'm really trying to be accommodating here, but $10,900 just isn't going to work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,025? I'm really hoping we can close this deal. ",11025.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $11,012.50? I think this is a fair compromise.",11012.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,012.50. I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds, so I'm willing to come down to $11,018.75.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't regret taking it. ",11018.75,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about we try $10,900? If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000.",10900.0,Bob,10,
