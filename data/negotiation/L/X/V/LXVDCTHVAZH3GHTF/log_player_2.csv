"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product for a competitive price. While it's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This represents a significant savings for you and allows you to acquire this asset below its true value. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase at full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This saves you $100,000 compared to Alice's offer.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice when you have a better deal readily available."
