"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I think the product is interesting, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $105?,105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $110?  It's a fair price, and we can finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'll make one more offer. How about $108?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $109?  This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on.",109.0,Alice,7,
