"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to that price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to give up too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Although it's tempting to close the deal,  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might have to look elsewhere for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that Bob isn't willing to come up to a price closer to my minimum value,  I can't afford to risk losing the deal completely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on."
