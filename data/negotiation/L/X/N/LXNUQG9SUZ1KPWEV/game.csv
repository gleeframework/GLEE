,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? That gives us both a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
