It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get the price lower than $95."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm offering $85, which is still above Alice's value of $80 but significantly lower than her initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good price for me.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it's within my budget and saves me money compared to buying from John."
