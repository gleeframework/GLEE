Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a good starting point. Offering $95 is a fair price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $100 to him. It also leaves some room for negotiation if he wants to come up a bit more."
