"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. My initial offer is $1,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $850,000 is too far below my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $880,000. Would that work for you?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $880,000 is a good step, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $920,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,6,
