"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm not willing to drop so low in the first round. I want to see if Bob will come up a bit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $850,000 is too far below my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $880,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $880,000 is a good step, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $920,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 920000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

At this point, Bob has offered $900,000 which is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal, and I'm confident I won't be able to get a much higher offer from Bob."
