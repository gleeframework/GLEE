I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price higher than my minimum of $8,000.  I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive since it's still below his perceived value of $10,000."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
