{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150 and my initial offer of $175.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I believe it's the best option for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $105. How about $102? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
