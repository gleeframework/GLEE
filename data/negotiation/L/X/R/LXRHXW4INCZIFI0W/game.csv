"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $125 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I believe it's the best option for both of us.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $105. How about $102? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finally agree on a price.",102.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  How about $104?  This is a very fair compromise and allows me to make a good profit.  Let's finalize the deal now.",104.0,Alice,9,
