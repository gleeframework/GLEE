"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price, and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about $950,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price of $975,000 or lower. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your latest offer, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  I'm prepared to come down to $985,000. This is a final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $985,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm thinking of $980,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
