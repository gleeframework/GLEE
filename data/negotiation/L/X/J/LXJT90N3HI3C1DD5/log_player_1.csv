Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's an opportunity to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,400,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy. It's a significant saving for him compared to rejecting the offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and reduces the chance he'll try to negotiate the price down.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible sale price by leveraging Bob's valuation of the product while still having John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
