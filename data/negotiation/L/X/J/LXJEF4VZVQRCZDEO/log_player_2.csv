Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a competitive price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $500,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $700,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has drawn a line in the sand. She's unlikely to go much lower, especially since she declared this her final offer.  While we could try to haggle a little more, the potential savings are getting smaller, and we risk pushing Alice away entirely. Accepting $700,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
