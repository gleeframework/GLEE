"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $19500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",19500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice, but $18750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $17000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,6,
