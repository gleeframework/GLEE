"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm offering $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to move from my initial offer, but we need to find a figure that reflects the significant value this brings. How about we meet halfway and consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to a deal.  Let's find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment and your willingness to increase your offer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the significant value you're getting and shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,600,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. Considering the value this product brings and the time we've invested in this negotiation, my final offer is $1,450,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  we've both come a long way, and I truly value your product.  To reach a deal that benefits us both, I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,400,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I believe it reflects the value we've both discussed.  Let's seal this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
