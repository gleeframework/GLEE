"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $1,600,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still within a fair range considering the product's value to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product for both of us.  I'm confident this will be a win-win situation.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to go.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
