"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $800,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway. To be honest, $800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be open to $725,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $775,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can afford. How about $750,000? That's a significant price and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000. This is the last compromise I can make, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",765000.0,Alice,7,
