Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $765,000. This is the last compromise I can make, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.

It's getting late in the negotiation and Alice is clearly signaling that this is her final offer. While we might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of her walking away and having to pay John $1,000,000 isn't worth it at this point. Accepting $765,000 is a good deal."
