"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, so let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still leaves a fair margin for both of us.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $90?  That would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to finalize the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget. $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. That way we both get a fair deal.  What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
