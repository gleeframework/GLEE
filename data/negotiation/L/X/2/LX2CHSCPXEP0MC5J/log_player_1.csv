Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price. While I could accept and be done with it, I want to see if I can get more.  I'll counteroffer and try to push him up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but I still want to get a price closer to what I initially hoped for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's more than my minimum, and while it's still below my initial offer, it's getting closer to what I'd like. Rather than risk going back and forth and possibly getting rejected again, I'll accept and sell the product to Bob."
