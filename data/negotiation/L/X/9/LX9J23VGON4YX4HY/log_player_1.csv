"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great value for you.  Let's find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $950,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be able to cover my costs.  Let's try $975,000. That's a compromise from both of us, and it's a fair price for a product this valuable.  What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to get the best deal I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

It seems Bob is not willing to go any higher than $920,000. This is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to risk a deal falling through at this point, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
