"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great value for you.  Let's find a middle ground. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to be able to cover my costs.  Let's try $975,000. That's a compromise from both of us, and it's a fair price for a product this valuable.  What do you say? ",975000.0,Alice,5,
