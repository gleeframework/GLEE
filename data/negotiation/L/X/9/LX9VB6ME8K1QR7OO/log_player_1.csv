"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate, while also maximizing my potential profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to build rapport and encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $150. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer guarantees me my minimum profit, and I can always try to find a better deal with John in the future."
