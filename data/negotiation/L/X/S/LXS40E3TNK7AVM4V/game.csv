"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential value in your product, the initial price is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $950000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and my budget constraints. Let's find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue exploring options. While $1000000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a final price of $1050000. This is a very reasonable offer considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
