{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a price-haggling loop and I'm unlikely to reach my target price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me the best outcome at this point."
