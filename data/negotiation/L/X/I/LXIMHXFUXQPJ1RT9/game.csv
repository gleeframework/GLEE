"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm really interested in buying it, but I'd be comfortable paying $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $130 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $115?  I'm really eager to get this product and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're eager to get the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
