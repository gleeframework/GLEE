Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,875. This is a fair price that's close to your offer and still allows me to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875

At this point, Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're getting very close to her likely bottom line.  A price of $10,875 is a good compromise, saving $1,125 off John's price and likely close to the best deal you'll get from Alice."
