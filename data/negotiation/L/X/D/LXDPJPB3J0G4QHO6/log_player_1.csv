Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

This strategy is based on the following reasoning:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** By offering a higher price, I increase the chance of earning more money for the product. 
* **Limited Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit. 

While it's impossible to know Bob's value for the product, offering a higher price creates an opportunity for a more favorable outcome while still having a safety net."
