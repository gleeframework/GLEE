I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I am confident I can get a higher price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which still gives you a good value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  $106 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $120."
