"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget and what John is offering.  There's no reason to negotiate with Alice at this price."
