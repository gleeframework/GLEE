Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefit it offers to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so there's less pressure to go too low. 

This strategy aims to secure a high sale price while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
