Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some space to accept a lower counteroffer if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's not too aggressive, making it more likely Bob will consider it. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation effectively while maintaining a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum price of $120, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is still a good outcome. It's better than his initial valuation of $80 and allows me to avoid the potential risk of further negotiation.  It's also a good starting point for future interactions with Bob, as he may be more willing to negotiate a higher price in the future."
