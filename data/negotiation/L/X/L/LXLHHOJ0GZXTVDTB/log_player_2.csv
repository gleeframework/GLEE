While Alice's offer is tempting, there's potential to save even more.  By rejecting, I can initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price. I'm willing to risk some negotiation to try and maximize my savings."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it's a strong starting point for negotiation. I believe there's room for compromise between my offer and Alice's initial price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can drive the price down further. There's still a chance to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,100,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Alice while still keeping me within my budget."
