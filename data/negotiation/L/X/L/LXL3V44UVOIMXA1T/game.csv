"I understand you think $9,000 is a bit steep, Bob. However, I've done my research and I know this product is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting the price I want. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more. How about we try $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept it. I think the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
