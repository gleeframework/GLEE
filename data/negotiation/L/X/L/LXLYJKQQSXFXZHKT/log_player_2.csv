Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value, while offering a fair deal for both of us.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $925,000 is still slightly below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $987,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and giving you a great deal on this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $987,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're very close to reaching an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's make this deal happen!

At $975,000, Alice is getting very close to her bottom line, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Continuing to push could backfire and she might not budge further. Accepting this offer secures a significant discount from both her initial offer and John's price."
