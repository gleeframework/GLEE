"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be equally valuable for you.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value, while offering a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $925,000 is still slightly below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $987,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and giving you a great deal on this valuable product.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $987,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be open to that?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close to reaching an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",975000.0,Alice,7,
