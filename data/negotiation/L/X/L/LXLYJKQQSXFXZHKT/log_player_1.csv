Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be equally valuable for you.  My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value, while offering a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'll try to push for a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $925,000 is still slightly below what I need. How about we split the difference and go with $987,500? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and giving you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 987500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $987,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds, or at least reach a point where selling to John is the better option."
