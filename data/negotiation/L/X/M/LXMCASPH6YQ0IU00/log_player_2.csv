The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice's offer is way too high.  I will reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product. This is a fair price, as it's what I would pay John for the same product.  Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer."

While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's within my budget. Hopefully, she'll see that this is a good deal for both of us."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

I'm going to meet Alice halfway and offer $115. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on."

```

Alice is still being stubborn. I'm not willing to pay more than $115, and she's not budging.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
