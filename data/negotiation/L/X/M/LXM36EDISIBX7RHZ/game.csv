"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7500 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $8000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
