"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Intrigue:**  Highlighting the product's value without revealing specific details might pique Bob's interest.

**Strategy:**

This first offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:**  Bob's offer of $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum of $8,000. Accepting would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest. This indicates potential for further negotiation.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,500 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us to make the offer more appealing.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is unwilling to pay $8,500.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward. If Bob rejects, I will consider his counteroffer and continue to negotiate in the remaining rounds, keeping the potential sale to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $8000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Met:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Gain:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price. Bob might get more stubborn or even walk away.
* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, the risk of further negotiation is too high, especially considering the dwindling number of rounds and the reliable alternative of selling to John."
