"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to signal that you're not willing to pay anywhere near her initial price.  We can start negotiating downwards from here."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice has come down significantly, but she's now at her valuation.  We know we have a better deal with John. Let's push her a little further to see if there's any wiggle room, but be prepared to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I do see the value in the product, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially go up to $9,000, but that's really my limit."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the value you placed on the product at $10,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and we've managed to get her down to $11,000. However, John is offering the product for $10,000. It's time to cut our losses with Alice and secure the better deal with John."
