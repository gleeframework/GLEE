"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $8,000 for it to make sense for me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum asking price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I do see the value in the product, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially go up to $9,000, but that's really my limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Considering the value you placed on the product at $10,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
