"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is below my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, and I'm confident that with a bit of back and forth, we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have another buyer lined up. I will counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $120 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  Let's make this work. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep my spending under $100. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below the price I'm aiming for. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't settle for anything below $115.  I believe we can reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $115 is my final offer. If you're truly serious about getting this product,  it's a good deal for both of us. Think about it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really like your product and appreciate your offers. I'm willing to go up to $97 for it. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$97 is still far from my minimum value and closer to what I initially offered in the first round. I'm not going to settle for that. I'll keep trying to negotiate and hope for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement. $105 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I value your product, but I can't exceed $98. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm no longer confident that Bob will meet my minimum value. I've already rejected his last two offers, and there's no guarantee that he'll come up to my price in the next round.  Rather than risk further rounds of back-and-forth, I'll sell the product to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum value and end this negotiation."
