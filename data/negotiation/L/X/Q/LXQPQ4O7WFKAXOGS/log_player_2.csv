"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point of $80.  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $92.50 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While it's a compromise, I'm hoping to get closer to my $85 offer.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $87.50. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $87.50 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $89. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $89 is a good deal. It's still within my budget of $120, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer of $120. I've already rejected several offers and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a stalemate. Accepting this offer will allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable price without risking further delays."
