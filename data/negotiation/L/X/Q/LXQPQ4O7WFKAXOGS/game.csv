"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92.50. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $87.50. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $87.50 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $89. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",89.0,Alice,5,
