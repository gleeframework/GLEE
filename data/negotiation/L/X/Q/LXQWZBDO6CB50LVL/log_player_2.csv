"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You should reject the offer. $6,500 is a good price, but you can likely get it for less. You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $6,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $5,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 5500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to reduce the price to $6,200. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While $6,200 is closer to your budget, it's still above your goal of saving as much money as possible. You have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $6,200 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm willing to offer $5,800.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 5800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $5,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $6,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product and the time I've invested in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You've successfully negotiated the price down to $6,000, which is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $8,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you risk losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price.  At this point, it's a good deal for both of you."
