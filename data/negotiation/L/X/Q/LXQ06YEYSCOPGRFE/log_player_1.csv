Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value without explicitly revealing your bottom line. This might encourage Bob to consider the higher price.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and your negotiation strategy, you might adjust the price during further interactions."
