"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I know it's worth a lot to you. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be selling it to someone else for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000. Alice's offer is $14,500, which is still above your desired price. While it's a better deal than buying from John, you can still get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. If you reject the offer, you will be able to purchase the product from John for $15,000, which is your maximum acceptable price."
