"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I need to be mindful of that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee me my minimum, but I want to explore if a deal with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,750. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $8,750 is still too low. I am confident that I can get closer to $9,000 by continuing the negotiation.  I still believe there's potential to close a deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John would be the safest option, but I'm going to try to push for a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $8,700 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call!  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already given Bob two chances and we're stuck at a price that's still below my minimum of $10,000.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high, and I could end up with a worse deal or lose the deal altogether.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum and minimizes the risk of coming up empty."
