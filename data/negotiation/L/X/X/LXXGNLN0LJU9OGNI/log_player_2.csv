{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'd like to offer $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows you a good profit and stays within my budget."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In light of your latest offer, I am willing to consider $985000 as a fair price for the product. This allows for a good profit margin while being within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $985,000 is very close to your desired price range. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If you reject this offer, there's a chance that Alice will become less willing to negotiate further, and you might end up having to pay more in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Factor:** You've already used up several rounds of negotiation, and buying from John would cost significantly more. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's relatively close to your target and avoids the potential of a higher price or having to buy from John."
