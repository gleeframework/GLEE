"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $12500 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $11500 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $13000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway from your previous offer and propose a price of $12750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12750.0,Alice,5,
