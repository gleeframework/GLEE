"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the value of this product. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let's see if we can make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
