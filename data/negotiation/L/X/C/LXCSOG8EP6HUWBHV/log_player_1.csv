Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the value of this product. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered $1,250,000, which is a decent amount and closer to my desired price point.  While I'd love to get more, I'm concerned I might not get a better offer, and I'm already within a comfortable range. It's time to accept and close the deal."
