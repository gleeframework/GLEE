Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get a good chunk of that. I'll offer him the product for $120.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. Since I have the option to sell the product to John for $100, I'll consider that. However, I'll also think about the potential of getting a better offer from Bob in future rounds.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

Considering the option to sell the product to John for $100, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer of $95.
