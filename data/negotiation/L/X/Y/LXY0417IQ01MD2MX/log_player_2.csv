Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  $75 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $85? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction.

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach my target of $80 or lower.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
