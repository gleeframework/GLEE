Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) and higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and enthusiastic message can encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $110 is a high price, it's not unreasonable. This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, and for me to potentially negotiate down to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:**  The fact that I can sell the product to John for $100 is a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I'm guaranteed to get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $65 is significantly below my minimum price of $100, and even below what the product is worth to Bob ($80). Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it indicates he's still interested in the product. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is a Safe Option:** If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $110 to $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I'm not losing money.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more to him ($80) and that my counteroffer is still a good deal.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm not completely giving in. This leaves room for further negotiation if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $90 is still a little steep for me though. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, $75 is still below my minimum price of $100. Accepting this offer would mean selling the product at a loss for me.
* **John is a Safe Option:** If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell the product to John for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **More Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  $75 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $85? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm continuing to compromise by lowering my price from $90 to $85. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer of $75 and my last offer of $90. This strategy often encourages a sense of fairness in negotiations.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that $85 is a fair price for both of us, making it less about what each individual wants and more about finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum price while still leaving room for Bob to make one last counteroffer if needed."
