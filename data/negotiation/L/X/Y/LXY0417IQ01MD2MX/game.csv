"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $90 is still a little steep for me though. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  $75 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $85? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction.",85.0,Alice,5,
