""message"": ""Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm excited to share this product with you as I truly believe in its value. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,500,000. I think it's a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your belief in the product's value. While I understand your perspective, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a higher price, and it introduces risk. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your minimum acceptable price without further delay or uncertainty."
