Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly exceptional.  $1,400,000 significantly undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product is exceptional, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a higher price than his current offer and we're not extremely desperate yet (we're not below our absolute minimum)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your position."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,580,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for a bit more, Bob has now stated this is his ""final offer.""  $1,580,000 is a significant profit, and continuing the negotiation has a risk of Bob walking away entirely. It's better to accept a strong offer now than to risk ending up with John's $1,000,000."
