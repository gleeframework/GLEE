"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $115.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  How about we split the difference? I'll accept $110 for the product. That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm still at $105.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $105 and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can secure a higher price. There are still six rounds left, and I'm willing to take a risk to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $108. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 108}
