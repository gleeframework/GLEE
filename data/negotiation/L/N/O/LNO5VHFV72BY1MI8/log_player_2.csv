Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm not sure $1,025,000 is quite enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. My counteroffer is $1,075,000 is too low, so I will try to be more aggressive and offer $1,100,000 is also too low, so I will go to $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is trying to push the price higher. Her willingness to go up to $1,150,000 after rejecting $1,025,000 suggests she's aiming for a price closer to your maximum.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal outweighs the potential savings. John's offer of $1,200,000 is your guaranteed best outcome."
