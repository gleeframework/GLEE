"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for a price of $13,000. I think it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to go lower?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $12,000 is lower than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **A compromise:** Alice is willing to meet halfway, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  A counteroffer might result in Alice rejecting it, leading to a higher price or a potential dead-end.  Accepting her offer secures the product for a decent price."
