"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product, and Alice's initial offer is exactly that amount, there's no immediate incentive to accept. You can reject the offer and explore the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice. If that fails, you can always purchase the product from John for the same price."
