"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $11,150. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product.  What do you say?",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,950?",10950.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $10,950 is still too far from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle at $11,050. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",11050.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. I'm willing to make one final concession - $11,000 is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about buying the product, this is our last chance to make a deal.  What's your decision?",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $10,850, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",10850.0,Bob,8,
