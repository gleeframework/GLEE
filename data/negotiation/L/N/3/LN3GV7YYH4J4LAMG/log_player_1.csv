{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering the value it brings, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount for me but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and investment potential of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By setting a price slightly lower than my minimum, I'm leaving room for Bob to make counteroffers while still ensuring I get a reasonable price. 
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.
* **John as a Backup:** Remember, I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing negotiations.
* **Leverage:** I have John as a backup, which gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and push for a better deal. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll carefully consider a counteroffer that balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiations."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being reasonable to keep Bob engaged.
* **Emphasizing Concession:** I'm highlighting that this is a significant concession to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Fair Compromise:**  Framing the offer as a fair compromise appeals to Bob's sense of reason and increases the likelihood of acceptance.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1070000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a balance between the product's value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's counteroffer is now only $10,000 away from my desired price point of $1,080,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get closer to $1,080,000, there's a risk that Bob could walk away entirely or stall negotiations.
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging negotiations could cost me valuable time and potentially lead to a loss in opportunity. 
* **Secure Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's close to my minimum and is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.

**Conclusion:**  The potential loss of time and a better deal are outweighed by the certainty of a sale at a reasonable price."
