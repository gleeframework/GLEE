{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting them, I'll eventually end up with a deal that's significantly lower than John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the $1,200,000."
