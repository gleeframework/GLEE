"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $1,125,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  However, $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in this negotiation.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
