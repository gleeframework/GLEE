"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I value your offer,  $1400000 is below my minimum threshold.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1750000.  This would still allow me to get a fair value for the product, while also giving you a significant opportunity to benefit from it. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
