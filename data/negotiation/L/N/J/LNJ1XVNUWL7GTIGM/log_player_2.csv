# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer is closer to your maximum than her minimum."
