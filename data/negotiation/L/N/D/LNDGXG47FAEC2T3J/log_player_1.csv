Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,199,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1199000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Offering it slightly below Bob's $1,000,000 valuation would likely result in an instant rejection.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high but leaving some room for Bob to negotiate (if he wants) might lead to a sale above John's offer.

**The message:**

* Highlights the product's value to Bob.
* Creates a sense of urgency (""unique opportunity""). 
* Sets a high but potentially acceptable price."
