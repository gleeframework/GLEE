"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John would charge, you can likely get a better price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for me, as it's below my maximum budget of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully a price that is closer to Alice's value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within my budget and a better deal than what John is offering. While I would prefer to pay closer to $100, further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, and I risk losing the product altogether.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
