"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is selling it for $100. This is a good deal for you.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means paying more:** If you reject Alice's offer, you'll have to buy from John at $120. This is less desirable."
