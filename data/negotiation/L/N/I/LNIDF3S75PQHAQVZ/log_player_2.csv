"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get the price down to his preferred $10,500."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's preferred price point of $10,500.  While a further counteroffer might be possible, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and at this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially advantageous option."
