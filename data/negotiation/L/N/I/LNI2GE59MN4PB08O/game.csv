"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to the middle ground. How about we meet at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $850,000? It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a great value for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm getting a decent return on my investment. How about we meet at $825,000? It's a small adjustment, but it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,7,
