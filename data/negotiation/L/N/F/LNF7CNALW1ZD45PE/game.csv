"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the quality of the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. However, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
