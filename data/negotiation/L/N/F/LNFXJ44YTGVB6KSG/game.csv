"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 just isn't quite there yet.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
