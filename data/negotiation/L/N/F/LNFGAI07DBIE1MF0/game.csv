"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,250,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let's make this deal happen.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,290,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
