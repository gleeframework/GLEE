"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is only slightly better than John's guaranteed price. There's room to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's opening offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards. It also signals that we're serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is a better price, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for under $100, and Alice's response suggests she's willing to move further from her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97?  That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential deal.  This offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer and closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal! Alice has reached her minimum price, and we've successfully negotiated a price well below John's offer.  There's no point in pushing further and potentially losing the deal."
