"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle - would $10,500 work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a little too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,500?  That's a fair offer, reflecting both the value and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate your perspective on the value, but $7,500 is still too low for me to consider. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price, but I'd rather make this deal work with you. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500?  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
