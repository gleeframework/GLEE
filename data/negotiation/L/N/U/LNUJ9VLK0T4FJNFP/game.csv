"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my product is worth a lot more. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
