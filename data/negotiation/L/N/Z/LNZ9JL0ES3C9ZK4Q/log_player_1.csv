Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation is helpful, I don't want to start too low. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valuable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,100,000 offer is significantly above Bob's valuation but still below my minimum. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he expressed interest, I have a strong alternative with John. I'll counter-offer to gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Slightly):** I've come down in price, but not drastically. This signals I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The $1,050,000 is still a substantial profit margin for me and keeps the negotiation moving without capitulating to Bob's initial offer.
* **John Remains an Option:**  I haven't forgotten my fallback position. If Bob remains too low, I can walk away and still achieve my desired outcome with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still too far from my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I will counter-offer one more time to test Bob's willingness to move closer to my range.  If he doesn't budge significantly, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can do $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower. This is my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly states that this is my last concession. It puts pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justification:** By saying it's ""cutting it close to my bottom line"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and suggesting there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I've set my price at a point where I'm comfortable walking away and selling to John. This puts me in a stronger position, as I'm not desperate for Bob's acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet my final offer and is incrementally increasing his bids. While $980,000 is a good price, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  The difference is substantial enough that it makes more financial sense to proceed with John, even considering the time spent negotiating with Bob."
