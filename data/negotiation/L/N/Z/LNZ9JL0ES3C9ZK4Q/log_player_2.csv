# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can do $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower. This is my final offer.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I made a mistake earlier. I should have sent a counteroffer instead of just rejecting the offer. Since Alice has already made a final offer, I'll try to make one last attempt to get a better price. I'll send a counteroffer of $980,000, which is still below Alice's final offer.
