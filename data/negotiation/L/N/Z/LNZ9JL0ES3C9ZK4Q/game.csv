"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can do $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower. This is my final offer. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
