"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the value it holds while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still above my limit.  To find common ground, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, showing my genuine interest in this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect that. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $1,700,000 is still too high.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,450,000.  This shows my serious interest in purchasing your product, but I need to stay within my budget.  This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
