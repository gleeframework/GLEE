"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer above your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" the message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point for discussions"" clearly signals that Alice is open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a deal, accepting $800,000 would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident that further negotiation can lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000. This is a substantial concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding (But Not Agreement):** Acknowledging Bob's budget shows empathy but doesn't imply agreement with his valuation.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Re-emphasize that Bob's offer is significantly under the product's worth, subtly anchoring the value in his mind.
* **Significant Concession (But Strategic):**  Dropping the price by $100,000 is a substantial move, signaling a willingness to negotiate. However, we're still aiming well above Bob's initial offer.
* **Framing for Agreement:** Presenting the offer as a ""fair deal for both of us"" encourages Bob to view it positively and reciprocate with a move towards our target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still aim to stay within my budget. Would you consider $950,000 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $950,000 is still significantly below my target price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal by continuing the process. John's offer is always a fallback option if negotiations stall, but for now, I'll aim for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I see you're serious about this purchase. To show my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** Recognizing Bob's movement encourages him to continue negotiating.
* **Smaller Concession:** The $25,000 decrease is smaller than the previous round, signaling that we're reaching our limit.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. This also subtly implies that if he rejects this, we might walk away and consider John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $975,000 is a strong price point that's significantly above Bob's initial offer while still leaving room for him to potentially counter with a more appealing number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $960,000 as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob countered my ""final offer,"" indicating strong interest in the product.
* **Favorable Price:** $960,000 is a significant gain over his initial offer and a reasonable compromise. While not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations or losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids further uncertainty or potential delays."
