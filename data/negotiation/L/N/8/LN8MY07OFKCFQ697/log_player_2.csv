"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth that much to you. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice is offering the product for its maximum value to you. There's no room for negotiation. 

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While it doesn't make a difference in this specific scenario whether you buy from Alice or John (since the price is the same), it's generally good practice to avoid potential pressure tactics from sellers. Alice mentioning another buyer at the same price could be an attempt to rush your decision."
