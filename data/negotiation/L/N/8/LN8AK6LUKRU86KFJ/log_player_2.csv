"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am eager to share it. I propose a transaction where you could own this product for $12,500. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also offers you a considerable savings compared to its true market value. I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition for both parties. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true market value, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal for him."
