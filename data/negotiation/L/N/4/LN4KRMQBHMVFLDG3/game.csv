"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250? It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's make this happen.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my means. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,800 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,800 and $13,000. How about we try $12,900? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to stay within my means.",12900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,900 is still not quite enough for me.  Let's try $13,000 one more time.  It's a fair price, and it would allow us both to walk away with a win. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for your product, but I'm really struggling to justify the cost at $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $12,950, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",12950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $12,950 is still not enough.  This is my final offer: $13,000. If you accept, we both get a good deal. If you reject, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",13000.0,Alice,9,
