"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  Offering $115 allows for a few rounds of counteroffers without falling below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below Minimum:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I can potentially get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Time Remaining:**  I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Within Range:**  $110 is still above Bob's offer, but within my acceptable range and closer to his offer.
* **Show Flexibility:**  Offering a compromise shows a willingness to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's making progress. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  Reminding Bob about the value of the product reinforces the reason for my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $108.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Final Offer:** While Bob states it's his final offer, there's no guarantee he won't budge further. I'm willing to risk it by making a counteroffer.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have 6 rounds left to negotiate, so there's still time to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112, but I can't go any lower.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility Again:**  I'm continuing to show flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but I'm staying within my minimum acceptable range. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm reinforcing the idea that my offer is fair, considering the value of the product.
* **Set a Deadline:**  I'm giving Bob a clear indication that I'm nearing my limit, which may encourage him to accept.
* **Time Remaining:**  I still have 5 rounds left, so I can afford to make another counteroffer if necessary."
