Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher by mentioning a public listing.  
* **Backup Plan:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, there's little risk in aiming higher with Bob."
