{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, aiming to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, allowing for a potential win-win scenario.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and my assessment of his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12000. Would you be open to negotiating a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product, which is good. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still push for a higher offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.

**Next Steps:** 
I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial $15,000, but higher than $12,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $14,000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Negotiation:** I'm countering Bob's offer while still showing flexibility.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  A price of $14,000 represents a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's, making it seem like a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial asking price, demonstrating the value I place on the product.

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to assess whether I'm willing to lower my price further or if it's time to consider selling to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is reasonable, and there's always a chance I could convince him to increase it again in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a guaranteed outcome, but continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving me with nothing. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Focus on Building Trust:**  I'll emphasize that I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate and that I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.
* **Potential for Upselling:** I'll explore if there are any additional services or options I can offer Bob to potentially increase the overall deal value."
