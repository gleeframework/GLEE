"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You know you can get the same product from John for the same price. This gives you the leverage to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be open to negotiating a bit?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $14000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your desired price point of $12,000. While $14,000 is a better price than her original offer, it's still not the best deal you could get.  You can continue negotiating with Alice to try and get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
