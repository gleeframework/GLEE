Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate while still aiming for the highest possible profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to sell to Bob at $780,000 than to sell to John for $800,000, as the transaction with Bob is potentially less hassle and takes less time."
