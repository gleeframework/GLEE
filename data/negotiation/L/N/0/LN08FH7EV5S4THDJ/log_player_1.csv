"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for some back and forth while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better.  While $100 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a fair price, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum, but I'm coming down a bit to show flexibility and keep the negotiation moving.  $110 is a good compromise point and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and ensures I'm making a profit. It's also likely that Bob won't budge much further, so accepting this offer is the best way to secure a sale in this round."
