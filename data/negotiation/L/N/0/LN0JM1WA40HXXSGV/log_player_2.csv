"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value to me and allows you a good profit as well."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. How about $12000?  It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this quickly.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $12,000 is still above his desired price point. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate and there's room for Alice to come down a little further. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a bit more, but $12,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $11,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us and let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 11500}
