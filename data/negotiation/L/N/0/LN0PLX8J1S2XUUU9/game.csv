"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's split the difference and make this happen.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
