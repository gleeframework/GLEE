"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product at a special price of $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it presents a fantastic opportunity for you.  While I value your business, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000, so I need your decision by [date/time]. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. John offers the product at a price that fits within your budget.  There's no reason to negotiate with Alice when you have a better deal readily available."
