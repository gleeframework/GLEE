"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  $1,000,000 remains a fair price for both of us. It allows for a quick deal and a win-win situation. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
