"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can do better.  While $10,000 is a good price, he can likely get it lower by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  This product is worth $12,000 to me, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend around $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a great price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to his target, he can still do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9,000? That's a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This is a fair price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the price of $9,250 is very close to his target of $8,500, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting this offer will save him $2,750 compared to buying from John."
