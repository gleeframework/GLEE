Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his target price of $12,000."
