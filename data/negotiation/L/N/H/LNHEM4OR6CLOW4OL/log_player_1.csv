Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. Would you consider $135?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $135. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While $125 is still slightly below my initial asking price, it's a fair compromise and higher than what John is offering.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with less."
