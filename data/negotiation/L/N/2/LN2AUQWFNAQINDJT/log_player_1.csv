Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its value. I can come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, we are still pretty far apart.  I can go up to $700,000.  But I need to be closer to that number to make sense for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow rate. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us within the remaining rounds. Selling to John now guarantees the $800,000 and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later."
