"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and unique benefits of this product. To move closer to a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still think $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
