Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value and potential benefits for Bob.
* **Flexibility:** This price allows for some room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but also keeps me closer to my minimum desired value. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The potential sale to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for it at this time. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While $850,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below the $1,000,000 I would get from John.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe I can likely get a higher price from him through further negotiation.
* **Time Factor:**  I'm not under immediate pressure to sell, so I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This takes into account the value you place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Slightly Below My Minimum:**  I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the $875,000 price is a fair compromise that considers both our perspectives. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using language that encourages agreement and reinforces the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still wants to counteroffer, but not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $875,000. My maximum budget remains at $850,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has made it clear he won't go above $850,000, and I'm not willing to go below $875,000.  
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's more efficient to sell to John and get my desired price. 
* **Security:**  Selling to John ensures I get the $1,000,000 I need and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a successful outcome."
