"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit for me. I'm confident in the product's value and believe that this price point will spark a productive conversation."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a drastic reduction. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round, giving Bob a chance to reconsider."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'm starting to run out of time, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counter again, hoping to reach a final agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm finally offering my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the deal before I have to sell to John. This is my final offer, as I won't go lower than my minimum value."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing.  While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that John will purchase the product at my minimum price, so I'll choose to sell to him to ensure a guaranteed profit."
