"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It doesn't matter if you buy from Alice or John, as both options cost the same amount.  Since you want to save as much money as possible, and both options cost the same, you might as well accept Alice's offer."
