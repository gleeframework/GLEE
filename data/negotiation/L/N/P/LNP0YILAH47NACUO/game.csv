"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair reflection of its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique aspects of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a significant concession and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which reflects a compromise and shows my genuine interest in this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm proposing $1,650,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
