Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $120. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a small profit."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Unfortunately, I am unable to go above $120 for this product. Would you be able to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've decided to sell the product to John for $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's insistence on $120 means further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher offer. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value without risking further rounds of negotiation."
