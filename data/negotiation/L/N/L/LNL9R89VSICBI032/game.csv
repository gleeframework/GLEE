"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still leaves some room for you to get a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
