"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my own budget constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept.  I'm confident in the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise given our previous offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
