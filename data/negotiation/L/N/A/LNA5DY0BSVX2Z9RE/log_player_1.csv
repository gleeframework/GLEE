Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying well above your minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, pushing for a price too close to that increases the risk of him rejecting the offer. A slightly lower price significantly increases the chances of a successful sale."
