"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you at a competitive price. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $800,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and the potential value this product holds for your business.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I can do $900,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know if we can make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply isn't a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a final offer that still provides a good return for me while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
