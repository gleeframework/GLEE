"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe it's a good compromise considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, reflecting a compromise on my end.  This price still allows me to achieve my goals with the sale. Let's see if we can find common ground at this point.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target price. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. I think this is a fair middle ground considering the value I'll get from it.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your target price.  However, $850000 is still a significant distance from what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer the product for $925000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you'll receive.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
