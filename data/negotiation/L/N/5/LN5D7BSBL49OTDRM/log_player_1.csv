Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

Explanation:  Bob is consistently lowering his offer and is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll come up to $1,500,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
