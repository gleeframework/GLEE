Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, but not excessively high.  It allows room for negotiation while still leaving a good profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is your minimum, you can likely do better. By rejecting and sending a counter-offer, you can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than your initial counteroffer of $135.  It's a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum of $120, and it's likely you won't get a better offer from Bob."
