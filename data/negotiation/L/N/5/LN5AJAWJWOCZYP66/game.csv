"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your price of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
