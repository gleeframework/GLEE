Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable price:** It's a bit lower than your minimum, but still leaves you some room to negotiate.
* **It's a good starting point:** It allows for Bob to counter-offer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's friendly:** This establishes a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but you also want to keep Bob engaged and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $100.  You have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, so it's worth pushing for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87 is closer to your minimum desired price, it's still lower than what you can get from John.  Since you have a guaranteed $100 offer, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, who might continue to push for a lower price."
