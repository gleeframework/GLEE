{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown.  It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a significant amount, Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. She knows the product is worth at least $15,000 to her. Rejecting the offer allows her to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about $17,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14500? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still aiming to maximize her profit.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to her minimum, it's still below her floor. She has a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so there's no reason to settle for less at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is simply too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and settle at $15,750?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still staying within your budget."", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price.  She has a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $15,000.  It's more beneficial for Alice to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
