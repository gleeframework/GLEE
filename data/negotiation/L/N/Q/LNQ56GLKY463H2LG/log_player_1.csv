Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $145 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $155?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $150? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum price, and it's the same price John is offering.  There's no reason to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
