"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's true value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price is fair given my assessment of its worth and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise between our two offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and my target profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for this product. It's a significant investment for me, and this price reflects my maximum limit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your maximum limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll make a new proposal of $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
