"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $120 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $150 is not a good deal. You can get the same product from John for $120. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and proceeding to the next round of negotiation makes sense. You can then try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer of $150, but still a price I'm willing to pay, as it's lower than what I'm willing to pay John.  This counteroffer creates room for negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $130, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay John.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $115 for the product. This is a further compromise from my previous offer and is getting closer to my maximum price point of $120. I believe this offer is reasonable, as it's a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $125, it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay John for the same product. Since John is offering the product for $120, which is my maximum price, it's more logical to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
