"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  It's definitely a good starting point. I'm interested in buying the product, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This would still be a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go quite that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, which would be $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for both of you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's fair considering the value of the product.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,130,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of you. What do you think?",1130000.0,Alice,5,
