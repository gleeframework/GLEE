Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.

Alice is now matching John's price, and there's no guarantee we can negotiate her down further.  It's time to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
