Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a touch above what I had in mind. Would you consider $875,000? I feel that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a price of $925,000. This is my last concession, and I hope you'll meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I can feel your commitment to getting this done.  How about we split the difference and call it $900,000?  That should work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $915,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more by going to another round, it's getting risky. Accepting at $915,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,000,000 price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
