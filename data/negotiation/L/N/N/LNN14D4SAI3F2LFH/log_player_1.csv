Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  You still have room to make concessions. 
* **Reasonable:** It shows you're willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Would you be willing to go up to $95? It's still a great deal for you and gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I am unable to meet your current offer of $95. I would like to continue the negotiation, so I am proposing $92 for the product. I hope this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 is still slightly below my preferred price, it's very close to my minimum and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
