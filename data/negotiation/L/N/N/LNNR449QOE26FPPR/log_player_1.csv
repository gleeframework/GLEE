Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This is a high starting price, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. It's important to start high and leave room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $900,000 is still below my minimum desired value.  I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise but still leaves me with a good profit margin. It also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is still a bit below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum. At this point, the negotiation is taking time, and I don't want to risk Bob walking away completely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
