"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500?  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
