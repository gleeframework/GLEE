Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so he has room to negotiate down from your price.
* **It's a good first offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value the product.

If Bob rejects, you can assess his counteroffer and decide if you want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer. We want to see if we can secure a price closer to our original $13,000.  We can use the next round to make a counteroffer and potentially meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500?  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the middle:** $11,500 is a good compromise, being right in the middle of your last offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000).
* **Profitable:**  It's still a higher price than selling to John, which ensures you're making a profit.
* **Potential for future deals:**  By agreeing with Bob now, you may be able to build a relationship for future potential deals. 

While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential gain."
