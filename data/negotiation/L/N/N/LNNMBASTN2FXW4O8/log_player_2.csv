You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $13,000.  While it's a good deal, Bob has a higher budget and can potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good deal.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $12,000. He can likely get closer to his goal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
