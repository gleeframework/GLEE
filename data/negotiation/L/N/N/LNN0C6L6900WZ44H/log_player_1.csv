Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the value I place on the product. I'll see if Bob is interested in this price, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still gives me a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it. It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and I'm happy to secure the deal."
