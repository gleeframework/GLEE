"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by expressing my belief that he'll like the product.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep the price under $80 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not going to sell the product for less than it's worth to me. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $85? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to your offer."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his counteroffer.  This shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also sticking to my minimum price.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
