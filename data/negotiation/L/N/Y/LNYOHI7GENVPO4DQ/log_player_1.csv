"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still maximizing my potential earnings.  I'm hoping to entice Bob with a slightly higher price than John's offer, making it a more attractive option for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have plenty of rounds left, and there's still a good chance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay this much, especially since he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer. This offer shows that I'm serious about maximizing my earnings while remaining open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the offer. I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that is fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise a bit by lowering my price to $11,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,250 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter again. I have a few rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for a price that's below my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11400}
``` 

I'm going to make a slight counteroffer of $11,400. This shows that I'm open to negotiations, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, Bob will be more likely to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds and the negotiations are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable accepting anything below $12,000.  To guarantee my minimum profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
