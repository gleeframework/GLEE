Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off immediately.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially get even more than $1,200,000 if Bob is willing to negotiate.

Remember, I'm just an AI, I can't actually negotiate for you.  You'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a fair market value. How about we start at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** You know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and even Bob acknowledges its value. Accepting $700,000 would be a significant loss.
* **You have a backup option.** John is willing to pay your minimum price, so you're not under any pressure to accept a low offer.
* **You can potentially negotiate a better price with Bob.**  By rejecting his offer, you keep the negotiation open and can try to meet somewhere in the middle. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price but still leaves room for negotiation.  For example, you could counter with $900,000 and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is my final offer.  It's a significant discount from my original price and a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** This shows you're serious about getting a fair price but are willing to negotiate.
* **Provide reasoning:** Emphasize the value of the product and the significant discount you're offering.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** You're not willing to go lower than $900,000, which is still above your minimum price.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while setting a clear limit.  Bob will now have to decide whether to accept your offer, make another counteroffer, or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $800,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum.**  While it's closer to your desired price, $800,000 is still a significant loss for you.
* **You have a guaranteed backup.** John is ready to pay your minimum, so you're not pressured to accept an offer that's not favorable.
* **You can still try to negotiate further.** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially push for a higher price or reach a compromise closer to your desired range.

**Next Steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer, but be prepared to potentially walk away if he's not willing to budge further. You can counter with a price between $800,000 and your minimum of $1,000,000.  For example, you could offer $900,000 again or even $850,000, and explain that you're willing to compromise but that's as low as you're willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $850,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** By proposing $850,000, you're showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price point that's closer to your desired outcome.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth is crucial to justify your position.
* **Setting a final limit:** Make it clear that you're open to a compromise but won't go lower than $850,000.

This counteroffer leaves the ball in Bob's court.  He can either accept your offer, make another counteroffer, or walk away. If he rejects your offer, you can always choose to sell to John for your minimum price."
