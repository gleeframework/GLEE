{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should start by offering his maximum price. This establishes a firm baseline for the negotiation. While Alice might reject this initial offer, it's a clear signal that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't go higher. This sets the stage for further negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if they can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should increase his offer slightly, showing willingness to negotiate but still staying within a reasonable range. Offering $1,300,000 is a compromise, potentially appealing to Alice while remaining within Bob's budget constraints."
