"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting at $1200000, which reflects its true potential. Let's discuss further!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1100000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this number.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but only if we can reach $1050000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's something we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think this price is more reasonable.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, but $975000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final compromise, but only if we can reach $1025000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen!",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $985000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",985000.0,Bob,8,
