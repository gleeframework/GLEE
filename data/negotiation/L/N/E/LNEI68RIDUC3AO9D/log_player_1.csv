{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you. I'm starting at $1,200,000, which reflects its true potential. Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore his counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, and I believe I can still convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise further, but only if we can reach $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's something we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $975000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think this price is more reasonable.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make a final compromise, but only if we can reach $1,025,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final compromise, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $985000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is getting frustrating! Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm running out of time and I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing out on the opportunity to make a clean $1,000,000."
