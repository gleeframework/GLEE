"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you valuing the product, but $125 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $175 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is a fair price considering my maximum is $100.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",150.0,Bob,4,
