"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $1,200,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This leaves a fair margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. Would you consider $1,230,000? I feel that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,230,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,270,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1270000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  How about we settle this right now at $1,250,000? It's a strong offer, and it saves us both from more back and forth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,250,000. This is getting very close to my minimum and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
