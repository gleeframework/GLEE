"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to pay $700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value considering its rarity and uniqueness. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Considering the value and rarity, I'm prepared to pay $750000 for it. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $750000. I'm counteroffering $800000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's rarity and uniqueness. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
