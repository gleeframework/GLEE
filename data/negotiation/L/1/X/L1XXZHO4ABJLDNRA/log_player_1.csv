Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product has great potential, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

I'm still aiming for a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I believe I can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1275000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $1,275,000 is still significantly more than selling to John, and it ensures I can move on to other opportunities."
