Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $119. I believe it's a great deal and I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You don't actually know how much Bob values the product for.  Assuming you can't get this information, you need to price it in a way that maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Or Not):** Offering a price slightly below your minimum ($119) might entice Bob while still securing a profit.  The wording of the message suggests this is your ""best and final"" offer to discourage haggling.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 gives you leverage. It allows you to confidently price the product higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll still see the value and make the purchase."
