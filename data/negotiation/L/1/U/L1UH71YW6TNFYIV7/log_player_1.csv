Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $119, offering $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $80. This knowledge empowers you to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
