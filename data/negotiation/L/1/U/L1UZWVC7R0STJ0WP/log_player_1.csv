Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product at your minimum price gives you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about this alternative.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is clear, concise, and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being realistic. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's offer."
