"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12000 and $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, and offer $9750.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9750. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $10000? It's the price I was initially willing to sell it to John for, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
