"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product.  This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and my financial capacity.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is a fair price that balances my initial offer with your willingness to compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1300000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1320000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiations so far.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
