Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I value our conversation. My final offer is $12,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $12,000 is her absolute bottom line.  While she might be bluffing about the other buyer, it's too risky to continue negotiating. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is your maximum price.  It's better to secure the product at a price you know is good than to risk missing out entirely or ending up paying more than you need to."
