"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to start the conversation at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted for. I would be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. To be frank, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. If you're serious, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique benefits and my confidence in its value for your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents significant value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my current budget. I can see us potentially closing a deal around $900,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I recognize the importance of finding a mutually beneficial agreement. To show my commitment to making this work, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects its inherent value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. Your willingness to move on price is encouraging.  However, to be realistic, the maximum I can offer at this time is $1,000,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise and demonstrates my serious intent to purchase the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up significantly in your offer.  I'm very motivated to close this deal with you, so I'm willing to make one final concession.  I can let go of the product for $1,300,000.  I believe this price truly balances its value with your commitment.  Let me know your thoughts, as I believe this is a fair and final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. While $1,300,000 is closer to where I need to be, I still can't justify that price. I can stretch my budget to a final offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a strong offer and represents the absolute limit of what I can justify.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
