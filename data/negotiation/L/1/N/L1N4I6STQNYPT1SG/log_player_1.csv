The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob's offer is lower. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,250?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is offering.  Since I have a limited number of rounds and I'm happy with the price, I'll accept Bob's offer."
