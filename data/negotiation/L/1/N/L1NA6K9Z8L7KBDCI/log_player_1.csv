Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great deal for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering $100, which is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $120. This means I have a backup option if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Negotiation:**  By starting with a price that's not my absolute minimum, I create room for negotiation and potentially reach a price that's higher than $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  John's willingness to pay $120 means I'm not under any extreme pressure to accept Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a little closer to my initial price. How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer of $100 and his offer of $90.
* **Remaining Room for Negotiation:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still leaving room for potential negotiation, should Bob reject this offer again.
* **Appealing to Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $90, and $95 is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Deadlock:**  I've already made a compromise, and Bob's offer shows he's unwilling to meet me halfway. Further negotiation is likely to be unproductive.
* **John's Guaranteed Sale:**  John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose any money. 

**Conclusion:** It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale with John that meets my minimum price."
