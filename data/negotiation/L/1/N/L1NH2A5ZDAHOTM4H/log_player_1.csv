Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you a significant buffer for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Clear and direct:**  The offer is presented directly without being overly aggressive. 

**Why not a lower price?**

While starting lower might seem safer, it leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might be willing to pay more than $1,200,000, and starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.  You always have John as a backup."
