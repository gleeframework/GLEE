,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product for significantly less than it's worth to you.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,300,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product and your potential profit.  Let's close this deal and both of us walk away happy!",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer.  We've both been going back and forth, and I think it's time to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
