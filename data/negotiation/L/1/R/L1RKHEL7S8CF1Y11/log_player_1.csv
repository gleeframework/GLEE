Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a calculated risk. It's high enough to potentially incentivize Bob to buy, as he still makes a profit of $100,000. However, it's also a significant discount from the $1,500,000 it's worth to him, leaving room for negotiation if he's inclined. If he rejects, you still have John as a backup, securing your minimum value of $1,000,000."
