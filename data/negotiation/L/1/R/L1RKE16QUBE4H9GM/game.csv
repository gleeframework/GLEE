"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm confident you'll find this offer competitive.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,050,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
