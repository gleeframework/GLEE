Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. It's a fantastic deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could try for a higher price, getting too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer."
