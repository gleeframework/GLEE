,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest. While I do see the potential in your product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1000000 is far too low for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1100000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1150000. This price reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
