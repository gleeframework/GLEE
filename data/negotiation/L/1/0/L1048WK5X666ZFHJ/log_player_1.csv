"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential in your hands. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a price of $1050000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price, and I have 8 more rounds to do so. Selling to John at this point would be settling for the bare minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1075000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a slight improvement, but it's still below my desired price. I'm not desperate to sell at this point, and I still have 6 rounds left to reach a more favorable agreement. Selling to John at this point would be giving up too much potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in this product, but $1,075,000 is still below the true worth.  I'm willing to go a little further and offer it for $1,090,000.  This represents a significant compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,082,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. There are 4 rounds remaining.  I'm hoping to secure a deal closer to my initial asking price. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close. I want to make this work, but $1,082,500 still falls short of what the product is truly worth.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to offer it for $1,085,000. This is my final compromise."", ""product_price"": 1085000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1087500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,087,500 is very close to my desired price.  With only two rounds remaining, there's a high risk that Bob will further reduce his offer, or I'll have to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a deal."
