"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still attractive to Bob, but also leaves some room for negotiation for me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I can likely get a better price if I continue negotiating. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for something closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's unlikely that we'll be able to get a higher price in the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $125."
