"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's try to find some common ground.",115.0,Bob,4,
