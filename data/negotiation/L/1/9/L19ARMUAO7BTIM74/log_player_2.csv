# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This reflects the significant value the product holds for you. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

While Alice is coming down, there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for closer to $8,000."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? "",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is sticking to $10,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower and we're getting close to John's price.  It's better to secure the deal now."
