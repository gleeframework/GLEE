Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose a price of $500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation and allows for both of us to find a mutually beneficial solution.
