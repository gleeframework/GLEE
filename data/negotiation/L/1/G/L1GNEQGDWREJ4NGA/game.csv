"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and increase your profits significantly.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. This product is very interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your organization, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $650,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $550,000.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $550,000 is a bit higher than your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $600,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're firm on the value, but I have to stick to my budget. I can do $575,000 today to finalize this.  Let me know if that works for you.",575000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $620,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $575,000. What do you think?",620000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that $580,000 is your absolute limit, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $620,000 and $580,000, which would be $600,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
