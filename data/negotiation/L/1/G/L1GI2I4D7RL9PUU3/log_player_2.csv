"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I understand it may be a large investment, but I am confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price, so this is a chance to secure a great deal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
