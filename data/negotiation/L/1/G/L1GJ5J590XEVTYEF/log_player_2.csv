It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $650,000."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to go up from here if necessary."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still worth trying to negotiate further. I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer."

Alice has come down to $625,000, which is still a good price.  While I might be able to squeeze out another $25,000 or so, it's likely not worth the additional rounds of negotiation. It's a good deal, and I'm ready to accept it."
