Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $7,500 is too low, but I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher. I'm going to take John's offer of $8,000, which is a better deal for me."
