(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's asking $140. I can probably get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$135 is a good price, as it's within my budget and leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It's also a better deal than buying from John."
