"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $100 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being a reasonable price considering the product's worth to Bob.
* **Setting a positive tone:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Leaving space for counteroffer:**  The message explicitly asks for Bob's thoughts, allowing him to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and I know the product is worth at least $80 to me.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  While $85 is a decent offer, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a better price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $80, I'm not willing to accept less than $85 at this point, as I'm confident I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $95. This would still be a great value for you, considering the product's worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but demonstrating flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Mid-Point:** $95 is a reasonable compromise, being halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to see the deal as worthwhile. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation, allowing Bob to make another counteroffer if he's still not satisfied."
