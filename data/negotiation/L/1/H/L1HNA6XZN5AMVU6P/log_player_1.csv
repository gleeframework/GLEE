Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net.  It makes sense to aim higher with Bob to potentially increase your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he might not be willing to pay that much.  There's a balance between aiming high and not scaring him away.
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation. Be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly if Bob counters."
