"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:** You'll pay $950,000, but the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, so you'll make a profit of $50,000.
* **Buying from John:** You'll pay $1,000,000, but the product is only worth $1,000,000 to you, meaning you'll break even.

It's always better to make a profit than to break even, so accepting Alice's offer is the better choice."
