"I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to the table.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
