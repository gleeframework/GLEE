""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a competitive price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice aims to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value might entice him to purchase, believing he's getting a good deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, providing a safety net if Bob declines the offer."
