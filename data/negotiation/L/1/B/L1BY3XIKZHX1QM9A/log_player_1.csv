Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $20 markup (20% over my minimum) is a common starting point in negotiations and leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value to Bob and a ""limited time"" to encourage quicker decision-making."
