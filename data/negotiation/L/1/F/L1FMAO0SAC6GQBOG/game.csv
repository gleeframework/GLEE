"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Given the product's value to you, I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your own value for it and my budget.  I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
