"Thanks Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you consider $95? ",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $95 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about $105?  This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $105 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
