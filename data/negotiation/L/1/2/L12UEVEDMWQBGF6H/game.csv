"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product,  $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, given my understanding of its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $1000000. Considering its unique features and value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
