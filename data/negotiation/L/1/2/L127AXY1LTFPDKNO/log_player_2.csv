"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since Alice values the product at $10,000, there is room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  It's still a great price for me, and I believe it's fair considering your value for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and closer to Bob's desired price range.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or Bob might have to settle with John's price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
