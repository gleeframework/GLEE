Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, the $2,000,000 price tag reflects the true value and potential this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above Bob's valuation and getting closer to John's offer.  There's room for Bob to come up and it's worth risking one more round to see if he will."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at this price."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** By mentioning John's offer, we signal this is our best price while maintaining a firm but fair stance.  This puts the decision point firmly with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've done some research and found that the market value for this product is closer to $1,400,000. Considering this, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,450,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could hold out for the full $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is a strong strategic move:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate has risks. Bob might walk away, and we'd lose both offers. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we get the money sooner, which has its own value."
