"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you a serious offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,000,000 is simply out of my budget.

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your target price.  It's worthwhile to keep negotiating to see if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still too high. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a substantial amount, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is still a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $800,000.  Given that you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's in your best interest to take that option and secure the product at the lowest possible price.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and you're already within your target range."
