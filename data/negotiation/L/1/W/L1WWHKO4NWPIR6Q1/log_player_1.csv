Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'd like to discuss a more reasonable price. I'm thinking along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, which is my final offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While I could push Bob further, his final offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount and it's better than risking him walking away entirely. It's a substantial profit, even if it falls short of my ideal price."
