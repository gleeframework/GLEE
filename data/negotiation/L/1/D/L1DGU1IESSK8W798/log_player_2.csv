"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $13,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice could become less flexible or the negotiations could drag on. 

By accepting this offer, Bob secures a good deal and avoids potential delays or a higher price from John."
