Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I believe this product is truly exceptional and worth the extra investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,162,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the value you receive.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very invested in getting a price as close to her valuation as possible. While we could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely she'll move much further. Accepting at $1,162,500 is a good deal considering our $1,200,000 limit and the risk of her increasing the price again."
