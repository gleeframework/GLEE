"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.**  You are willing to spend up to $100, so accepting her offer would mean paying more than you're comfortable with.
* **There's a chance to get a better deal.**  Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get the price lower. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price.** While you'd ideally get the product for even less, John offers a safe alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm willing to negotiate further. I would like to offer the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer matches your maximum budget.** You're willing to pay up to $100, and she's offering it for that price.
* **There's no benefit to further negotiation.**  You've already gotten her down to your maximum price.  Going further risks her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John, which would be the same price. 
* **Accepting ensures you get the product.**  There's no guarantee that you'll get a better price in future rounds, and you might end up losing the opportunity to buy."
