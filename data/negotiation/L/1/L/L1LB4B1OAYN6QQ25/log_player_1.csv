"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to the middle of our estimated values ($80 - $120). This leaves room for negotiation without immediately alienating Bob.
* **Friendly opening:** The message is friendly and establishes potential value for Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for both of us to compromise, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob has shown interest, and his offer is closer to my ideal price. This makes further negotiation worthwhile. 
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm happy to come down a bit, but $95 is my lowest price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price but still keeping it above his offer.
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I maintain control of the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $95 allows for a potential agreement while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $95. How about we meet at $92? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my ideal price:**  $92 is very close to my desired price of $95.
* **Time pressure:** We're already in round 4, and the opportunity cost of further negotiation is increasing. 
* **Potential for counteroffer:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer a better price in the next round, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Better than John's offer:** $92 is significantly more profitable than selling to John for $80."
