"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. Let's make this transaction smooth. Would you like to purchase it at the full value of $100?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I would like to offer it to you for $95, which still allows me to cover my costs and ensure a fair profit. I hope this proposal works for you.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. After considering your offer, I am willing to sell the product to you for $93. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",93.0,Alice,5,
