"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
