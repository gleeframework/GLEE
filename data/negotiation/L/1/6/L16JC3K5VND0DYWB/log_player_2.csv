# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers. What do you think?
