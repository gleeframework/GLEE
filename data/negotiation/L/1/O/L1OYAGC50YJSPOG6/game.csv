"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
