"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I stay within my limits.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500. I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a slightly lower price.  I'm going to offer $10,000, my absolute top limit.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a sale and me to get a great deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your top limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10250.0,Alice,7,
