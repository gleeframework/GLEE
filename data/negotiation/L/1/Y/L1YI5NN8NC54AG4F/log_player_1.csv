{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's estimated value but still significantly lower than my minimum value. This gives Bob room to negotiate and increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. However, if he rejects, I have room to lower the price further while still exceeding my minimum. It's also important to note that I have a backup option with John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll counter his offer with a price closer to my minimum."

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for less than what I need. I'll counter again with a price closer to my minimum."
