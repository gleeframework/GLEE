"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to Alice's minimum value ($10,000) as possible without risking losing the deal.  A counteroffer of $10,500 is a reasonable starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000.  This is a better deal for Bob than buying from John, and while Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no other option but to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice at this point."
