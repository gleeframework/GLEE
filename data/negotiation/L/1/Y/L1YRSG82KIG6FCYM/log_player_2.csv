"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's not worth it to buy the product for $120 when you can get it from John for $80. You'll likely get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer and counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

You're starting with a lowball offer, but it's a reasonable starting point considering your maximum budget is $80. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to overpay.  Let's see if she bites!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high. You're willing to pay $80, so keep rejecting and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

You're increasing your offer slightly, showing Alice that you're willing to negotiate. $75 is still within your budget and closer to Alice's potential selling point.  Let's see if this gets the deal done."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're getting closer to your target price, but $95 is still too high. It's time to counter again. You're showing Alice that you're a determined buyer, but you're also unwilling to overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

This is your final offer. You're willing to pay your maximum price of $80, but you're not going any higher.  You've shown Alice that you're serious about buying the product and that you're willing to negotiate, but you're not going to overpay. This is your last chance to close the deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still unwilling to meet your price.  Since this is round 7, you're running out of time to close the deal with her.  You've made it clear that you're not willing to pay more than $80, and Alice is proving stubborn.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John.  You'll get the product for your target price and save yourself further negotiation."
