"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still a significant amount above the product's value to Alice. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Since you're willing to pay less than Alice's offer, there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback.**  You have a backup option, so you're not pressured to accept a bad deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering both of our needs. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your desired price.**  $1,050,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer and within your acceptable range.
* **Further negotiation is risky.**  While you could try to push for a lower price, you risk Alice walking away and leaving you with only John's higher offer.
* **Time is a factor.**  The longer you negotiate, the more likely John might withdraw his offer or another buyer could emerge. 

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price and avoids potential complications."
