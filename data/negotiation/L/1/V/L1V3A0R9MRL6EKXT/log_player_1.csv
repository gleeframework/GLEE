{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing you to make a decent profit.

**Why this strategy?**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you create a sense of urgency and make Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation process. This increases your chances of getting a price closer to your desired amount. 

Remember, the goal is to reach a price that both you and Bob are happy with, while maximizing your profit.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate with Bob further, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price just yet.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than what John is offering. This will keep the negotiation going while still staying above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about $11,500? That's a good middle ground, and it allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that the product is valuable and worth more than $10,000.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a position that is still favorable to me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not comfortable selling the product for that low of a price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will continue the negotiation while still giving me a chance to get a price closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too far below my value for this product.  Let's try $11,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer of $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This ensures I'm not selling the product for a loss.
* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving slightly closer to Bob's offer. This shows good faith and keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to keep the tone friendly and constructive.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us.

This counteroffer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob while keeping the pressure on him to increase his offer.  Hopefully, this will lead to a final price that is closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but no more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $11,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Conclusion:**

The negotiation with Bob has reached a point where it's clear that we can't reach an agreement. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring that I get the price I want."
