"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a special price of $90. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $60. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable selling the product for that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $75? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $67.50?",67.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not ready to give up on getting closer to my target price. How about we try $72? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",72.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, I need to keep my budget in mind. How about $70, and that's my final offer?",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $75, so how about we try $72.50? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",72.5,Alice,7,
