Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $75, so how about we try $72.50? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $72.50. While we could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal at this point. It's more cost-effective to accept John's offer of $80 and avoid further back and forth."
