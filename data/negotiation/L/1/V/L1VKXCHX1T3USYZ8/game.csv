"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's potential while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still significantly lower than the value I see in this product. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
