"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. With that said, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price, but you can still try to push for a lower price. You're still willing to pay more than she's willing to sell for, which means there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can continue to try to get a lower price without losing the deal entirely."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,025,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm willing to stick to it.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,000,000. It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and you may not be able to get a lower price. It's better to accept this offer and save $175,000 compared to buying from John."
