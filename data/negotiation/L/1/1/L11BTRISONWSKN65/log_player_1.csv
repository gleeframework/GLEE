Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get more from Bob if possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and perceive the product as more valuable.

**Important Note:** While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's no guarantee Bob will accept. There's always a chance he'll reject the offer, and you'll sell to John at your minimum price."
