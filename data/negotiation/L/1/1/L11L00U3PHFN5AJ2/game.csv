"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is still higher than $10000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $11000. It's a fair price considering its uniqueness and the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $11000 is a bit high for me. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price closer to $10000? Perhaps $9500? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I think the product's value is still higher than $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $10250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's uniqueness. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, based on my assessment of the product's value, I am not comfortable with the price of $10250. I would like to propose a final offer of $10000. I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, considering the product's uniqueness and my budget constraints. I hope you can accept this offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
