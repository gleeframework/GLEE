Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob is unlikely to go higher than $14,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit of $2,000 over John's offer. Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob and being forced to accept the $12,000 backup."
