"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $18,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This offer reflects a fair compromise and ensures you're getting a great deal on a high-quality product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $16,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the value I'll get from it.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I can do $15,500, and that's my final offer.  I think this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a good deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the value I'll get from it.",14000.0,Bob,6,
