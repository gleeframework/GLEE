"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. That way, we can both benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original price. How about $900,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows us both to walk away happy.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
