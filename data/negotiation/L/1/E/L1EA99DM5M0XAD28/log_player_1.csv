Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's worth a significant amount to both of us, given its value. I'm willing to part with it for $1,700,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  You have no information about Bob's financial limits or negotiation style. There's a chance this offer could scare him off.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, be prepared to negotiate. You have some room to go down while still exceeding John's offer."
