{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for you, and it's a great opportunity for you to gain a substantial asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,750,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I'm starting with a high offer, knowing I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum. This allows me to negotiate from a strong position.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1750000. I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  This will give me a better chance of getting a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's compromise at $1,450,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,750,000 to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and emphasize that I'm willing to compromise but need to remain above my minimum price. I also reiterate the value Bob will gain from the product at this price.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that is both fair to me and still attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to pay $1325000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, I've negotiated with Bob for a few rounds and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. It's time to cut my losses and move on to my backup buyer, John.

I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price, ensuring I get the best possible deal for the product."
