""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the value it brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a significant amount, I believe the product holds even greater value for Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $950,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I believe the product is worth more, accepting Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing the sale altogether."
