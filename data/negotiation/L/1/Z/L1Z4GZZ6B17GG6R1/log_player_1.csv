Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $115 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and positive, aiming to build a rapport and make Bob feel valued as a customer. 
* **Strategy:**  This strategy balances earning a good price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. We'll adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than our minimum acceptable price of $120**.  While it's tempting to accept $105, we can likely do better. 
* **We are confident that we can get a higher price through further negotiation**. This is due to the following:
    * We know John is willing to pay $120, setting a clear floor for our price.
    * We've already established some interest from Bob, so there's potential for a deal.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to control the negotiation**. We can now make a counteroffer that is more favorable to us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** The counteroffer is $110, which is halfway between our initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a price above our minimum.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes compromise, making Bob feel valued.  It also highlights the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to his sense of reason.
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to  secure a deal that is closer to our ideal price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you do $108? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to our minimum acceptable price of $120.**  While we'd prefer a bit more, accepting $108 ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **The risk of further negotiation is higher than the potential reward.**  While we could try for a slightly higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving us with only John's offer of $120. 
* **We have a clear alternative (selling to John for $120) which limits our losses.** This gives us the confidence to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
