Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm open to offers, but I'm starting at $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is quite a bit below what I need to let this product go. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about we settle on $16,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it would be fair for me."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12000? That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm happy with. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if I can get a better deal. I still have time and I don't want to settle for something that is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $12,000 is still significantly below what I need to sell this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I can't go any lower than $14,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk not getting a good enough offer from him. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement."
