"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John or try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $975,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. I'm confident that this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has refused to go any lower than $925,000, which is still higher than the $800,000 John is offering.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice as the price won't likely go any lower."
