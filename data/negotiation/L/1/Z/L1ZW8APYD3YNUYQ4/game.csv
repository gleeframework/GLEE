"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $7800, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. I'm really interested in making a deal, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Can you consider $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $8000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. This is the last offer I'm willing to make, so I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more compromise. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7900, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",7900.0,Bob,6,
