"I can see you're really trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already said I won't go below $125. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus with the purchase, which will make it a great value for you. I'll meet you at $125, and I'll include a free accessory that complements the product perfectly. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,7,
