"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We're aiming high initially, significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though we haven't specified what the product is.
* **Open to discussion:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's perspective, signaling our willingness to negotiate.

By starting high, we gain valuable information about Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $800,000 would leave a substantial amount of money on the table.  It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. We'll proceed to the next round and aim to bring Bob closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value it offers and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but strategic decrease:**  We've made a substantial reduction from our initial asking price ($2,250,000 to $1,900,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement. However, we are still significantly above both his offer and your minimum price.
* **Reiterating value:** The message reinforces the product's value proposition, emphasizing its ""true potential."" This aims to shift Bob's focus away from purely price-based negotiation.
* **Aiming for middle ground:** This counteroffer sets a strong position while still leaving room for negotiation and hopefully bringing Bob closer to a price point acceptable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I appreciate you coming down, but to be realistic, I can't go higher than $950,000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your minimum. His latest message suggests a limit to what he's willing to pay. We need to decide if we want to continue negotiating towards his likely maximum or take John's guaranteed offer.  We'll continue negotiating for now, but we need to be prepared to walk away soon if progress is slow."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $950,000 offer doesn't reflect the true market value of this product. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Negotiation:** We start by recognizing Bob's efforts, which helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm but Fair:** While we significantly decrease the price again, we emphasize that it's a compromise and still represents a fair deal. This reinforces the product's value.
* **Time Pressure:** By Round 5, we're getting closer to the halfway point. We need to apply some pressure, and highlighting the ""true market value"" subtly suggests that other buyers might be willing to pay more.

This counteroffer balances continued negotiation with the urgency of securing a deal closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm sensing we might be at an impasse. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000, but that's really the absolute limit of what I can justify. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is signaling a hard limit at $1,100,000. While this is his highest offer yet, it's still significantly less than your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. 

* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of minimal increases and potentially losing John's offer. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer provides a certain and substantial profit.

It's in your best interest to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob for a potentially small increase."
