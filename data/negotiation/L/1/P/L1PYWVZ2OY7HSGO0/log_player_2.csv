"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $9,500. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum price is $8,000, this is the starting point for the counteroffer. This is the lowest possible price Bob is willing to pay, while still being within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  Furthermore, her counteroffer is even higher than her original offer.  There's no indication that she's willing to negotiate further, making it more likely that she'll continue to push for higher prices. In this case, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at his maximum price, ensuring he gets the product while staying within his budget."
