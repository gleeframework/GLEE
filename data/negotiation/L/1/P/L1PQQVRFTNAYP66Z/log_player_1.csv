Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Bob's offer:

While Bob is moving closer to my valuation, his final offer of $775,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Bob will go any higher, and I risk losing both offers if I continue negotiating.  It makes more financial sense to accept the guaranteed offer from John at this point."
