{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.** You want to save as much money as possible.  
* **It's early in the negotiation.**  You have 9 more rounds to potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have a guaranteed option."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $500 drop from Alice's initial price is significant and shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.  
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** There's still space to bargain if Alice counters."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down in price:** This indicates she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Still room for a better deal:**  $7,200 is a decent price, but you can likely get closer to your ideal price of $7,000 with more negotiation.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have plenty of rounds left to continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but steady:**  A $100 increase from your previous offer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway but still want to save money.
* **Testing for a deal:** This counteroffer is likely close to Alice's acceptable price, making it a strong potential point to close the deal.
* **Staying flexible:** If Alice rejects, you can still adjust your offer slightly higher in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer is only $50 more than your previous counteroffer. This is a very small difference.
* **Limited time:** You have only 5 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal to John. 
* **The deal is good:** Saving $850 is significant, and  there's a good chance Alice won't go any lower."
