"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price you're willing to pay, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price is still fair for both of us and allows me to make a profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price for the product and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $950,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is my final offer. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
