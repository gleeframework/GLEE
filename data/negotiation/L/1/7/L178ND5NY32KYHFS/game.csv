"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $90 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $70? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $70 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you agree.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale.",80.0,Alice,7,
