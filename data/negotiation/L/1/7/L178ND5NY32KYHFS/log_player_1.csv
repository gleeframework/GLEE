"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if there's any room for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to sell, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic drop in price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $90 is getting closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $70? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold.  I'm going to counter again, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $70 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is tempting, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to counter again and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 80}
