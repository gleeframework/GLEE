"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested in the product,  $6,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $5,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $5,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $6,200. This is a fair middle ground, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",6200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $6,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $6,000. This is a fair price considering both our goals.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",6000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,200 and $6,000. How about we try $6,100? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",6100.0,Alice,5,
