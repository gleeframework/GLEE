"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $6,500 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my target price of $8,000.  I have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm interested in the product,  $6,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to offer $5,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 5500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $5,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $6,200. This is a fair middle ground, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I still think I can get a better deal.  $6,200 is still a significant amount above my goal of $8,000. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $6,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $6,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $6,000. This is a fair price considering both our goals.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 6000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $6,200 and $6,000. How about we try $6,100? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $6,100 is very close to my goal of $8,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of reaching a stalemate or running out of rounds is too high.  This is a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the product."
