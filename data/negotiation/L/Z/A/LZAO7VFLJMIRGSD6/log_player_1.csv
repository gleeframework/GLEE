{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $850,000? Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, we're running out of rounds.  I'm concerned we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in time.  To avoid risking losing a sale entirely, I'll accept John's offer of $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
