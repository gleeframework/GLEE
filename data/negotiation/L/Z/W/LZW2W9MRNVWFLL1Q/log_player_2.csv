"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is way above his budget, and he knows he can get it for $10,000 from John. He'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice, but he has the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000? It's a very fair price considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He'll continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get a price closer to his $12,000 counteroffer, but he knows he can always buy from John for $10,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
