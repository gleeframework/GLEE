"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $17,500. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable price for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$14,000 is still a bit low, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $16,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If Bob rejects this, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is just above my minimum and a good deal considering we're on round 6.  I'll accept this offer and secure the sale."
