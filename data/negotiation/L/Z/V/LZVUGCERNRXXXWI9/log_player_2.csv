You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product for less from John. You have a better deal with John, but you should try to negotiate with Alice to potentially get a better deal."

You should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

While $11,100 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target."
