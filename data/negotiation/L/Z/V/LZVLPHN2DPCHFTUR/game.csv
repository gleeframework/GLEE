"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget. I can't go as low as $140, but I'm willing to come down to $155.  This is still a good deal for both of us and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That way we both get a fair deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
