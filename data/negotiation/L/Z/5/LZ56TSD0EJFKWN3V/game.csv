"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a unique piece and I believe it has a lot of potential value for someone like you. I'm asking for $15000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the unique nature of this item. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $10000 to $12000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $11000 is tempting, it's just a bit too low for me to consider right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500? I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of this unique product. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your effort to find a solution. While $11500 is closer to my expectation, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to justify the unique value of this product.  Would you be open to $12000? I'm really hoping to close this deal with you, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
