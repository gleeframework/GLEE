"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1050000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit, and $1000000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 again, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
