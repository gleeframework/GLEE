"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum price. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $9,000? This price is still well below my initial offer, and it reflects the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still higher than John's price. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We're inching closer to John's price with this counteroffer.  We're still aiming to get the best deal possible from Alice before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on the product. It's a win-win for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now small enough that it's worth securing the deal with John at your target price."
