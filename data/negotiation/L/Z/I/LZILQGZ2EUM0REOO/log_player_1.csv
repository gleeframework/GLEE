Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $11,500?  I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price,  $11,250 is a good compromise, and I'm worried that if I continue negotiating, I might lose Bob as a buyer altogether.  It's better to secure a sale at a price that's still profitable than risk getting nothing at all."
