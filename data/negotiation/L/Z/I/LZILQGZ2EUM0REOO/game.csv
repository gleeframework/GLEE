,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $11,500?  I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",11250.0,Bob,4,
