"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $117.50 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $115. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
