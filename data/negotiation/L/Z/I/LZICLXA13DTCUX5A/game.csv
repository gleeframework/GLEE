"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $95? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay under $100.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to compromise, but $95 is still a little too low for me. How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to save some money on this purchase.",98.0,Bob,6,
