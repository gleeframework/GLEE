"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount for Bob while still leaving me a good profit margin. I'm hoping to close the deal quickly, but I'm prepared for negotiations to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my original price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial counteroffer. I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise. It's a decent profit margin for me, and I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, I might not be able to reach a better agreement within the remaining rounds. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
