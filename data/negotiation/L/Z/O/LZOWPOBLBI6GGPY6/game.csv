,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this happen.",88.0,Alice,5,
