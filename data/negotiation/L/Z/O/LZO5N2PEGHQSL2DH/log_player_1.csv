Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While $1,200,000 is below my minimum value, it's a good starting point to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  Mentioning a ""fair price"" frames the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still providing me with a good profit margin. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm willing to accept John's offer of $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.** While it's closer than his initial rejection,  $1,100,000 is still not enough to justify selling to him.
* **There's room to negotiate.** I can counter with a higher price and see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **I'm not desperate.**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a strong safety net if this negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant discount considering the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm raising the price slightly, but not by much. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his initial offer.
* **Appeal to Fairness (again):**  Reiterating the ""fair price"" point helps frame the offer as mutually beneficial.
* **Emphasis on closing the deal:**  This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Still above my minimum value:** $1,150,000 is above my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm still comfortable walking away and selling to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for the product. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.**  While it's closer to my desired price,  $1,125,000 is not enough to justify selling to him.
* **Further negotiation is likely to be unproductive.**  Bob has already rejected two counteroffers, and he's not showing much willingness to compromise.
* **I have a guaranteed better deal with John.** Selling to John for $1,500,000  will yield a much higher profit, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a significantly better outcome for myself while minimizing the time and effort spent on potentially unproductive negotiations."
