"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, and Alice's initial offer of $200 is too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if a lower price is possible.  If negotiations fail, Bob can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to see how willing Alice is to negotiate. It's possible Alice will reject this offer, but Bob can adjust his strategy in subsequent rounds based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $175 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's closer to his budget, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has 7 rounds left, and there's no guarantee he can get a lower offer from Alice in the future. However, he also has the safety net of John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  $125 is still below his maximum budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's latest offer. This counteroffer is a good balance between trying to secure a low price and not risking Alice walking away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is tempting, Bob is still within his budget and has several rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his goal of $150.  If negotiations fail, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to meet Alice halfway. This offer is only $10 away from his maximum budget and significantly lower than Alice's last offer. This is a strong move, putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing a deal close to her asking price."
