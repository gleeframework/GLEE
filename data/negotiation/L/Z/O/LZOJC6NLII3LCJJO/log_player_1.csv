``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $10,000, giving you room to negotiate. It also conveys confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I was hoping for a slightly lower price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $14000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $14,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $14,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still get great value from this product."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. Could we agree on $14250 for the product? I believe this would be a fair deal for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,250 is close enough to my desired price point and is significantly higher than what I would get from John. Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids further negotiation."
