"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth a lot more to you than the asking price. However, if you're not interested, I'm already in talks with another buyer who is willing to pay $12000. So, you have a chance to get a better deal here.",15000.0,Alice,1,
