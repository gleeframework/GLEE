"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth a lot more to you than the asking price. However, if you're not interested, I'm already in talks with another buyer who is willing to pay $12000. So, you have a chance to get a better deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
