Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I could manage $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price considering its value to me.

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob offering $10,000 puts him right at his perceived value, and it matches what I can get from John. It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and I risk him lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds. Accepting now secures the sale."
