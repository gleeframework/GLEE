"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, though. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's split the difference and make this happen.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is right in the middle of our last offers. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
