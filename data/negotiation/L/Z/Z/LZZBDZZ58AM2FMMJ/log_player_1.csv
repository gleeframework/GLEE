"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value of $100 and allows for some negotiation room. It's important to start with a higher price to maximize potential earnings, but I'm mindful of not deterring Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also keeps the price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting close, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a sale at $135 than risk a lower offer or having to sell to John for only $100."
