"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $18,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  How about $16,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit, but $16,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $15,500 and close this deal. This is a fair price considering we're both getting what we want."", ""product_price"": 15500}
