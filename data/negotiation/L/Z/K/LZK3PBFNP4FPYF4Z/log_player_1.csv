Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you (Alice).
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $12,000 if Bob rejects your offer, ensuring you don't lose out."
