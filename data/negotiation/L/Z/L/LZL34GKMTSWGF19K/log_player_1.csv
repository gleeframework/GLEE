Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a starting price of $100, significantly higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and enthusiastic to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the unfolding negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. Here's why:

* **Potential for Better Offer:** There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more than $85. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **Setting a Precedent:** Accepting Bob's offer immediately could signal to him that I'm desperate to sell, making it harder to get a better price later. 
* **Time is on my side:** Since I have the option to sell to John for $80, I'm not losing out by waiting and seeing if I can get a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling my intent to negotiate further. I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer in the next round, taking into account Bob's initial offer and the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. While $85 is tempting, I'm looking for a little closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $95 for the product? I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering a price of $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm thanking Bob for his offer and reaffirming his interest to maintain a friendly tone.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to emphasize why $95 is a fair price.

**Strategy:** 

* **Middle Ground:**  By offering $95, I'm  trying to find a price that is attractive to Bob without compromising my own desired profit too much.
* **Room to Negotiate:** This offer still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob counters again.  I'm prepared to make further adjustments depending on his response.
* **Balancing Act:** My goal is to secure a price as close to my original asking price as possible while ensuring the negotiation continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Progress:** Bob has increased his offer to $90, which is only $5 away from my initial offer of $95.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but it also risks delaying the sale. Given the option to sell to John for $80, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction. 
* **Risk-Reward:**  While I might be able to get a slightly better price, the chance of Bob completely rejecting my next offer is real.  Accepting his current offer minimizes that risk.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value and allows me to close the deal without further delay."
