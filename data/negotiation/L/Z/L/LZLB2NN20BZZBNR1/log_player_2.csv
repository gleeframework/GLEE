"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be very beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a lower price. $13,000 is too close to our maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. $11,500 is too close to our initial offer."
