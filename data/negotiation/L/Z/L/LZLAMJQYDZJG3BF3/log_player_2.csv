"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for both parties. It leaves room for further negotiation while making it clear that I'm looking for a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good value and allows me to get closer to what I need.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

We're inching closer.  This counteroffer shows willingness to move from my initial offer while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I might accept, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'm willing to push a little further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your last offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,800. That would make the decision easier for me."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between our last two offers, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a competitive price. It's getting close to the point where I might concede and accept a slightly higher offer if she doesn't budge much."
