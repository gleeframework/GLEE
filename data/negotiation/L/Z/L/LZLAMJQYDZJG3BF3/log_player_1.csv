Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $7,000 is too low. I'm still hopeful to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good value and allows me to get closer to what I need. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer than before, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $8,000.  I'm not desperate and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your last offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,800. That would make the decision easier for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm running out of time and need to secure a sale. Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
