"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good value and allows me to get closer to what I need. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",8200.0,Alice,5,
