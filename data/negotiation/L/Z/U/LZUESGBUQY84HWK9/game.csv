"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you consider $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle - how about $14,500? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
