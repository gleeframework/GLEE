Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I believe this is a fair offer reflecting the significant benefits this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Bob values the product at $800,000, giving us room to negotiate above that.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,300,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's valuation but still offers a substantial discount compared to our guaranteed offer from John.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for further discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within a range that's still highly profitable for us.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the fallback option with John."
