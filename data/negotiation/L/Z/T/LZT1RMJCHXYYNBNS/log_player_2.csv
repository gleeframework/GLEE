"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I understand it might seem pricey, but let me assure you, it's worth every cent. Considering its worth to you, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both our interests. Would you be open to exploring an offer between $120 and $130? I'm here to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product from John for $100, which is less than Alice's offer of $125.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $25."
