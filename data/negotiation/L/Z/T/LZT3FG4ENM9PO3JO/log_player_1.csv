Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum of $15,000 but still higher than Bob's perceived value. It leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price that benefits both of us. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I always have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, it is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500? This is a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
