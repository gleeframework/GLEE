"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product. However, to be candid, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product's potential warrants a higher price, but $1,950,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
