Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, your initial offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product. However, to be candid, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair deal considering the long-term benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While she has come down from her initial price, it's still well above my budget.  I'm going to try and push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product's potential warrants a higher price, but $1,950,000 is still beyond my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
