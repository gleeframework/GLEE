Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm afraid $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, and I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob or by selling to John.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This price is still well above your offer and closer to the product's true value. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good opportunity for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair middle ground and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired amount. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also not completely ruling out selling to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your potential for profit.  I believe this is our final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. I hope we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm running out of rounds, and the risk of ending up with a less than ideal price is too high.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I meet my financial goals."
