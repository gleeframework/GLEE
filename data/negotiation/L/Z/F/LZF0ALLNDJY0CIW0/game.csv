"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800000 is far below the value of this product. I'm prepared to come down to $1700000. This reflects the unique features and potential benefits this product offers.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1700000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000, which reflects the value I see in the product and my financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm prepared to come down to $1550000.  This offer is closer to your range, and it still allows me to reach a price that makes this deal worthwhile. Let's close this deal, and you can start benefiting from this unique product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
