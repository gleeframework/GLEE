"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $12000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to getting this product, but I need to stay within my limit. I'm prepared to pay $9500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $10000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution.  While your offer is closer to my budget, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go below $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you halfway between $10000 and $9500. I'm offering the product to you for $9750. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
