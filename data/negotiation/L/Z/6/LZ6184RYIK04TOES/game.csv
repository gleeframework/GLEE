"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you while still allowing me to earn a good profit. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
