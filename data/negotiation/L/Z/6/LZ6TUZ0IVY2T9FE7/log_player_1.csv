Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've outlined, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000, which reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. I still believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
