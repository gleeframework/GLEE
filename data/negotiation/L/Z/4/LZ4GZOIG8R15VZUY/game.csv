"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While I can't go down to $10,000, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $10,500?  That's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose an offer of $10,200.
