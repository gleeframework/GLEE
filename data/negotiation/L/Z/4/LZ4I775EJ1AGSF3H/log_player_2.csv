It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:** We're in round 9, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Diminishing returns:** Alice is conceding very small amounts now. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal in the last round. 
* **Significant Savings:** Even at $890,000, we're saving $310,000 compared to John's offer.

Waiting any longer carries the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation falling apart entirely, forcing us to buy from John at a much higher cost."
