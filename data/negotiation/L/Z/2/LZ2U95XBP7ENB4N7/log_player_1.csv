"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but it's also above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident I can close a deal with John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm worried about running out of time.  It's also a good amount of money, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale by being too stubborn.  I'll accept his offer."
