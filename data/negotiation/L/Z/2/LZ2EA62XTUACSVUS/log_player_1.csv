"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still within the range where Bob is likely to find it a good deal. I'm also trying to build some rapport with him by highlighting the value of the product and expressing confidence in a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm going to try to get a better price. I'm confident that I can still get closer to my ideal price of $100.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm confident that I can get Bob to budge a bit further, and I still have 6 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again.  How about $92.50? This is a great price for you, and it's a good compromise for me.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
