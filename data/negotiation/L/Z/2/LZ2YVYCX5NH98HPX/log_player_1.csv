Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High but Reasonable:**  This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a range that might be considered, especially if the product offers unique advantages.

**Important:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down slightly or accept John's offer, ensuring you never sell for less than your minimum."
