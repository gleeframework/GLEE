"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you're offering, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I propose we settle on $95 for the product. This is still a fair price considering its value, but it leaves room for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still above my budget. Let's try $85. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Bob. How about we set the price at $90? That's a bit higher than your last offer, but still below my initial asking price. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,5,
