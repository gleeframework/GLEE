"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $110.  Would you be willing to do $140? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $140 is still more expensive than John's offer of $120. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
