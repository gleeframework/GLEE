Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is higher than the $120 Bob values the product at, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still higher than your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear opening:** The message is friendly and sets the stage for a potential deal. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John if the counteroffer is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm confident this product is worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $132 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's within a reasonable range and I don't want to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for less."
