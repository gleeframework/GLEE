Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $85. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial goal, it's only $2 less than what John is offering. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price close to my minimum, minimizing risk and potential loss of profit."
