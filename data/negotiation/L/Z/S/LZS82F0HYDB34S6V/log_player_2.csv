Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $20000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?

Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 15000}
