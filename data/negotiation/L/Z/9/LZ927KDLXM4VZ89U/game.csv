"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,200,000. My revised offer is $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's more than your minimum and still within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. My revised offer is $1,180,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,

My revised offer is $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me, so I will offer you $1,200,000 - 50000 = $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
