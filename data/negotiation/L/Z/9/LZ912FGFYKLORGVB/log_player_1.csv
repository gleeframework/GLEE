Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000.  Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, as that's my minimum value for the product.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $14,000 gives Bob a good deal (better than $15,000) while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum.  This increases the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer. 

If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum value."
