"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is still below my minimum. I'm going to continue negotiating.  I'm getting closer to my target with each round, so I'm optimistic I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering my absolute minimum price, $1,200,000.  This is my last chance to get a price from Bob that meets my needs. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob won't go higher than $1,050,000, and I won't go lower than $1,200,000. I don't want to risk another round and potentially lose out on the sale to John. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
