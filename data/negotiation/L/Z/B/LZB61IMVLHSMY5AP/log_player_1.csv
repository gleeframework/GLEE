{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's also polite and engaging, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $11,500?  I believe this price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $9000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a price I'm comfortable with, and I'm not sure I can get Bob to go higher."
