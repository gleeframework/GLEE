Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,190,000.  I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it just below John's price creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying within a profitable range. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, potentially swaying Bob even if he was initially hesitant."
