"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price above that.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This would still give you a significant value over your minimum price. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price of $12,000.
* **Further negotiation could be risky:** Bob might not be able to get Alice to go lower, and then he would have to pay more or buy from John at a higher price.
* **The value is still good:**  $13,000 is still significantly less than John's price of $15,000. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome."
