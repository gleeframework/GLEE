"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:**  I'm confident in the product's value and believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than its worth to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes I'm open to discussion and want to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $85 for this item. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price from Bob.
* **John is a Backup:**  While John is a guaranteed sale,  I'm not in a rush and can try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to lower the price to $95.  It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" Bob is getting at $95,  emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintaining Margin:** While $95 is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell below my desired threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time is a Factor:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and continuing to reject offers could lead to me having to sell to John for $100. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I'd ideally get closer to $100, it's possible that Bob won't go higher. Accepting now allows for potential counteroffers in future rounds. 

I'm willing to accept $90 as a reasonable compromise, given the time constraint and the potential for further negotiation."
