"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to accept this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer of $80, it's still my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not ready to accept just yet. I believe the product has value beyond that, and I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more than $80. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and closer to the price I believe the product is worth.  I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale."
