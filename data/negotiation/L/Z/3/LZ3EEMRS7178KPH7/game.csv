"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a good deal for myself. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for the best price, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm serious about buying this product, but I need a price that works for me. How about $10,250? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm willing to compromise.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to $11,250 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close to a price that works for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget one last time and offer you $10,500.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if we have a deal.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,9,
