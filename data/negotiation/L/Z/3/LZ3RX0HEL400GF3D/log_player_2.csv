"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really love! I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130,  what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. $135 is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $150 and John is selling it for $150. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
