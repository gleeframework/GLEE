"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in selling me the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, the lowest I can go is $950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the value this product brings. Please let me know your decision.",950000.0,Alice,5,
