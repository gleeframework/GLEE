Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant amount, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's important to start high, as I can always come down, but I can't go up once I've offered a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'll see if I can get a little more from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale."
