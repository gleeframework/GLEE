Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he shouldn't pay more.
* **Your Power:** You have the leverage because you have a guaranteed buyer.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the product's value.
* **Ambitious Price:**  The $1,750,000 price aims for a 16.6% profit margin above your guaranteed sale. 
* **Confident Justification:** You connect the price to the product's worth and potential benefits, rather than seeming arbitrary.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive opening might be preferable. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your $1,500,000 guarantee. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
