"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. My initial offer for the product is $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe the product's value is worth it, but I'm open to negotiations.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $880,000. This would allow us both to benefit from a fair transaction. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I'm happy to see we're getting closer, $900,000 is still slightly out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $890,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $895,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",895000.0,Alice,7,
