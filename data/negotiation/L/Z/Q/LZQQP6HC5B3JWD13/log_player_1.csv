"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if it's somewhat general) can make it seem more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to make significantly more with Bob. We need to leave enough negotiating space to make continuing with Bob worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am currently working within a tighter budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,500,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer was a significant jump down, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We have room to push for a higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,500,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?"",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate by making a counter-concession. However, we're still holding firm above the $1,500,000 mark. 
* **Middle Ground Tactic:** Suggesting a ""meeting in the middle"" can be a persuasive negotiating tactic, even if the middle ground still leans in our favor. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By staying engaged and countering, we keep the negotiation moving and gauge Bob's flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my current financial situation, could we possibly agree on a price of $1,600,000? This would allow me to secure the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,600,000 is a substantial profit over our minimum and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, and the increments are getting smaller. This suggests he's nearing his limit.
* **Time Value:**  We've already secured a great deal in just four rounds. Prolonging the negotiation for a potentially small gain isn't worth the risk of Bob decreasing his offer or stalling."
