{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:**  $1,100,000 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for bargaining:** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, allowing for potential counteroffers.

By starting with this offer, you create an opportunity for a back-and-forth negotiation while ensuring you remain above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price of $1,200,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a slightly lower price."
