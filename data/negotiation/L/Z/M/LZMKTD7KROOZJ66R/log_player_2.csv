{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, there's still room for negotiation. You're looking to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay from John.  You're close to your target price, but there's still potential to negotiate further and see if Alice will drop her price even lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer increases your offer slightly, showing your willingness to compromise while staying within your budget. It also sets the stage for a possible agreement in the next round, as the difference between your offer and Alice's last offer is now smaller."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $80,000 more than what you can buy the product for from John.  Considering there's only 5 rounds left, it's likely that Alice won't drop her price further, making this offer a reasonable compromise. You're still saving a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer, and it's worth accepting to avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
