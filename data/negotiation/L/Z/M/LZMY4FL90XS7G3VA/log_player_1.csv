Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Starting at $15,000 gives room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Highlighting exclusivity:**  Mentioning that Bob has an exclusive opportunity might make the offer more appealing and encourage a quicker decision.
* **Leaving room for counter-offer:** I'm open to Bob negotiating, and he might be willing to pay a bit more than $12,000 if he values a smooth and immediate transaction. 

**Worst-case scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
