"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the potential benefits the product could bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to compromise slightly. I'll accept $1,050,000. This allows for a fair margin for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I still believe $950,000 is a reasonable price for the product. However, I am willing to meet her halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a fair profit for Alice. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
