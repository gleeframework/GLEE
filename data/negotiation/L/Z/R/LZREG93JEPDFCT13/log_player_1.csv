Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering what you could gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, maximizing profit means getting the highest price possible from Bob first.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" it might make Bob more inclined to accept before he potentially loses the opportunity.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while still leaving room to ensure a deal is made."
