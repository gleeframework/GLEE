Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:

Bob has reached his absolute limit and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant increase. Accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss compared to John's offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
