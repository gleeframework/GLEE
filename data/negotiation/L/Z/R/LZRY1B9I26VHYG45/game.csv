"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  I could do $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still very far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I need you to come down significantly to make a deal possible. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000.  I believe this is a significant concession and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but we still have a long way to go to reach a fair deal.  I can go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
