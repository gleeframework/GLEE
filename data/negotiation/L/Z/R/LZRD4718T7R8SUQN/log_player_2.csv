Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,150,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 with John."
