"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $120.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was a bit too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which would be $100. That's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $100 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's target price of $80.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $80, it's in his best interest to buy from John."
