"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. Let me know if that works for you.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was a bit too high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which would be $100. That's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
