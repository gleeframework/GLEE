I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point given the unknown value to Bob. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I make a profit. However, I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a higher price."
