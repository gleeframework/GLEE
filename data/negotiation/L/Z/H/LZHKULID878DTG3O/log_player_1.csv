Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
