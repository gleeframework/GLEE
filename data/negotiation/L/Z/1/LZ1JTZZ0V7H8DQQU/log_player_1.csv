{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and you know it's worth $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but also lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's becoming clear that he's not going to meet my price point.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
