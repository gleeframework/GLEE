"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $80? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting your offer, but I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we try $82?",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $82. Can we try $79.50? I'm willing to make a small compromise, but I really want to stay under $80.",79.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay under $80, but I'm still not comfortable with $79.50. How about we meet in the middle again? Can we try $80.75?",80.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if we're getting anywhere with these offers. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I need you to meet me at $80 exactly, not $80.75. Can you do that for me?",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your request, but I'm not willing to meet you at $80 exactly. I'm willing to meet you at $81, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",81.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable going above $80, and I don't think the product is worth $81. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm going to make a final offer of $80. If you can't meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",80.0,Bob,10,
