"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me as a buyer.  However, I'm looking to pay a bit less than that.  I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still above your value for it, making it a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for $920,000, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $885,000 for the product.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and it's a good deal for me considering the product's value to me.",885000.0,Bob,4,
