"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is unfortunately way beyond my budget.  Given my research, I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value while remaining within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, so I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the value it holds.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,650,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about staying within budget.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,525,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while hopefully being manageable for you.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,525,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product while staying within my financial capabilities. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
