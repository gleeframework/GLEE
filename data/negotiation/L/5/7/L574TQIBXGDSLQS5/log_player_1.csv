Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is lower than Bob's value of $15,000, giving him an incentive to buy. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still higher than your minimum and closer to your desired price. It's a good deal and worth accepting to avoid further negotiations and potential complications."
