Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so the offer needs to be enticing but leave room for profit.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position.

By offering the product at $950,000:

* **High Chance of Acceptance:** There's a good chance Bob will accept as it's significantly below your minimum and allows him to gain $50,000 in perceived value. 
* **Significant Profit:** If accepted, you earn $950,000, which is very close to your maximum potential.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you want to sell to Bob if possible. If you were solely focused on the absolute highest price, you would simply sell directly to John. However, offering it to Bob first at this price point balances profit potential with the risk of losing the sale."
