"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $15000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, so how about $14250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $14000? That's only $500 more than your last offer, and it would allow me to make this sale worthwhile. Let's try to find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle at $13750? That's the best I can do, and I'm really interested in making this deal happen.",13750.0,Bob,8,
