"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe is of great value. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  I'm confident this product can be a great asset for you, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Building value:** My message highlights the product's value and potential for Bob. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** I make it clear that I'm willing to discuss the price. 

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest while leaving myself room to adjust the price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm confident this product is worth it to me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's positive that he's interested, $800,000 is too low. 
* **I have room for negotiation.** I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, but $800,000 is a non-starter.
* **Selling to John is still an option.**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price without risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you, and I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and demonstrating flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value, which justifies a higher price.
* **Seeking a middle ground:** I'm proposing a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while remaining firm on my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1200000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer matches John's offer.**  This means I can secure the same amount of money by selling to Bob or John. 
* **No further negotiation is necessary.** There's no potential to get a higher price from Bob, and the negotiation has already taken a few rounds.
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks running out of rounds and being forced to take John's offer.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure the desired price without further risk."
