"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is significantly higher.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potential for a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still allows me a good profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. There's still some room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get the price down even more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go lower than $1,340,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000.  Further negotiation may result in a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob spending more time negotiating is high.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible option, as it provides a good deal and avoids the potential for complications."
