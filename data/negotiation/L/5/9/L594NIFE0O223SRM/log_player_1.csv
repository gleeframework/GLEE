{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I believe it provides significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her own valuation but still higher than Bob's. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, who will pay $15,000. This gives her leverage to push for a higher price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but the framing (""significant value,"" ""competitive price"") could make it seem reasonable.
* **Profitable for Alice:**  While not the full $15,000, $14,000 is a strong profit margin. 

If Bob rejects this offer, Alice can still sell to John without losing money."
