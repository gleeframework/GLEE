Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1450000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth more than $1450000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $1550000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.
