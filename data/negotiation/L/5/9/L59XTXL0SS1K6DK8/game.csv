"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle somewhere around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
