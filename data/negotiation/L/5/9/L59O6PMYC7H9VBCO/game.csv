,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  That's closer to what I can afford right now.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $122. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $122 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $118.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $118 is getting closer to what I'm looking for. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $120. I think this product is worth it, and I'm willing to stand firm on the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll throw in a bonus feature that's not included in the standard package. This will make the product even more valuable to you. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,7,
