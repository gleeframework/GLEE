"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $10,000 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations. Let's aim for a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us. How about we start at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to pay more than what most would expect. Considering the value of the product to you, let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I propose we meet halfway between our last offers. Therefore, I suggest a price of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,750.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I propose we continue to narrow down the gap. My counteroffer is $8,900 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget constraints.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  However, $8,900 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, given my budget constraints. I'm willing to go up to $8,800 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also working within my budget.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
