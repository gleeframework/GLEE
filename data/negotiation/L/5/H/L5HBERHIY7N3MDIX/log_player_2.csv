"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can get a better price than $95, even if it means a few rounds of back-and-forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $90, especially since you know her bottom line is $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $87.50.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
