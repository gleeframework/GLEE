"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start our negotiation at a price of $2000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

While $1,500,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go below $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be confident that it's worth it. I'm counteroffering at $1400000, which is $100000 below my minimum. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $1,400,000 is still above my preferred price point.  Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to go with that option and save myself $400,000."
