"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 is simply not a viable option for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This price reflects a significant reduction from my original offer and is the lowest I can go.  Let's settle this and make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
