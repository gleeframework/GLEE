"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $20,000 price point. Would you be willing to consider $12,000 as a fair offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider meeting somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17,000 is closer to my budget, I still find it a bit high. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
