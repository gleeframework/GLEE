"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her initial asking price, it's still above your budget. You have room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to your $8,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her previous offers, it is still above your budget. You still have room to negotiate, and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $10,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above your budget, and you've already negotiated several rounds.  It's likely that further negotiation will not get you closer to your target price of $8,000. It's better to accept John's offer and secure the product within your budget."
