"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1500000 to me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a price of $1175000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her first offer, he's still closer to his goal of buying from John for $1,000,000. He should continue negotiating and try to get closer to that price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original price.

I'm proposing a price of $1225000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's latest offer is still too high for Bob, and the negotiation seems to be getting nowhere.  John's offer is the best option for Bob to reach his goal of getting the product within his budget."
