"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $82.50 is still above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That way we both get a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
