"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $82.5 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your budget and John's offer. You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $82.50 is still above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
