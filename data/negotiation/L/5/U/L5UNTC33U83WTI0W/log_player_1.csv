Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, knowing that my minimum is $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. If he rejects, I can always go back to my fallback option with John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd rather sell to him than John, I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully it'll be more appealing to him while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd like, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  Since I'm already at the final stage, I'll accept his offer. It's better to get $110 than $120 from John."
