"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $11,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little lower.  How about $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and keeps things moving.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by going down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about $10,500? It's still a good price for me, and I think you'll be happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
