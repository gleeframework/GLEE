"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $11,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,500:** This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum price of $15,000. 
* **Alice is likely to be firm at this price:** Alice has already rejected a lower offer, showing a willingness to walk away. 
* **Risk of going further:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will walk away entirely, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
