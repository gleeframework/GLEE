{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $115 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and the chance to increase the price further. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $100 and doesn't reflect the product's true value. It's worth pushing for a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $105? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
This counteroffer does the following:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:**  It shows Bob that you're not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **Offers a compromise:** It presents a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlights value for Bob:**  It reminds Bob that even at $105, he's still getting a good deal. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $98. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is closer to your minimum, it's still below the $100 you can get from John.  At this point, the negotiations with Bob seem to be going in circles, and you're not likely to get a significantly better offer.  

It's time to cut your losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
