"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's better than John's price, we have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, we can send a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:** We're aiming to get a good deal, so we're starting with a significant counteroffer, lowering the price by $100,000 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Staying within our budget:**  This offer is still within our maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer gives us room to negotiate further in future rounds if Alice rejects our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While she's lowered her price, it's still above what we'd ideally like to pay.
* **More room for negotiation.** We can likely get Alice to come down even further with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Avoiding unnecessary expense:**  We're not yet at a point where buying from John is the best option.  We want to see if we can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round to show we're willing to negotiate but not going too high.
* **Balancing price and progress:** This offer is a good middle ground. We're closer to Alice's desired price but still within our budget and leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Keeping the pressure on:** We're showing Alice that we're serious about getting a deal, but also willing to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer.** Her offer is now within $40,000 of our target price.
* **Still room for improvement.** There's still a possibility of negotiating a better deal.
* **Avoiding unnecessary expense:** We're not yet at a point where buying from John is the best option. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** We're increasing our offer by $5,000, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Closing the gap:** We're now only $10,000 apart from Alice's offer, making a deal seem increasingly likely.
* **Pressure tactic:** This offer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing a deal close to her desired price."
