"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximize my profit. I'm also mindful of the time limit and want to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet it.  I'm confident that with the time limit and John's offer as a backup, I can secure a deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'm also getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,300,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still firm in my desire to get a better price than his last offer. I'm hoping this will make him realize he needs to come up a bit higher. If not, I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price than Bob's last offer.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a difficult decision. Bob's offer is still below my desired price. However, I've already made several compromises and only have two rounds left.  Given the limited time, I'm concerned about Bob's willingness to negotiate further, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price,  and it's the safest option at this point."
