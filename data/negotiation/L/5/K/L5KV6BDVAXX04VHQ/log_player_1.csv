Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I want to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'm offering a price that still leaves him with a significant profit margin. This increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Leaving room for negotiation (in this case, $200,000) allows for potential counteroffers and keeps the negotiation going.
* **Alternative Buyer:** By mentioning John's offer of $1,500,000, I subtly imply a sense of urgency and my willingness to walk away if I don't get a reasonable offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $1,200,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Room:** By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to continue negotiations. This creates leverage.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to walk away just yet, as I still see potential in getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my ""final offer"", I add pressure and urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $1,250,000 is still above Bob's initial value of $1,000,000, ensuring that he gets a good deal while I still get a reasonable price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**   While I haven't explicitly mentioned John's offer, the ""final offer"" statement subtly implies my willingness to walk away if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I would like to counter with $1,225,000 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Difference:**  Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is only $25,000 less than my previous counteroffer. At this point, the potential for further negotiation is limited, and the risk of losing the deal to John becomes more significant.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, and there's no guarantee I'll get a significantly better offer.
* **Reasonable Profit:** While $1,225,000 is less than my ideal outcome, it still represents a substantial profit and a reasonable compromise.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations. Selling to John is still an option, but it might not be worth the potential loss of a sale to Bob."
