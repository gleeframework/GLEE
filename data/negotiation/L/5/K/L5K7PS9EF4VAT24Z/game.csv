"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $8,200, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",8200.0,Alice,5,
