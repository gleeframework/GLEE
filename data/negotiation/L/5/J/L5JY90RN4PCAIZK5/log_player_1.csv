"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:**  This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This allows room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer, highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation. I'm willing to go lower if necessary, but I want to see if I can get a good starting price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is still within my acceptable range, but it's lower than I'd like. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This is a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility while also trying to get a better deal.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's counteroffer and expresses my willingness to compromise. It also re-emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

*  Show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
*  Test Bob's commitment to buying the product. 
*  Push for a price that's closer to my initial asking price.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider whether to accept his next offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to sell for a higher amount, I need to consider the risk of further negotiation. If I reject this offer and Bob makes another lower counteroffer, I might end up selling to John for $10,000.

**Strategy:**

This round is about risk assessment. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale at a price that is still profitable. Continuing the negotiation risks ending up with a lower price or even selling to John for a lower price. 

**Decision:** 

Given the circumstances, I am choosing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $12,500."
