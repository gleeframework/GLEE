Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but leaving room for Bob to counter-offer allows for potential negotiation towards a mutually beneficial price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000)."
