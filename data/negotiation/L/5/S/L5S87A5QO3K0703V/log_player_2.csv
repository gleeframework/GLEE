Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your target price, and you have a few rounds left. You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price than buying from John at $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

You're increasing your offer again, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet in the middle. You're still below Alice's price but getting closer to a potential agreement. You have a few rounds left, so you can afford to be a bit more assertive."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've reached a point where you're close to your maximum price, and you only have a few rounds left.  While ideally you'd get it lower, accepting Alice's offer of $110 is the best option to avoid buying from John at a higher price. You still get a better deal than buying from John and only need to negotiate one more round."
