# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than her initial value, it's still more than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $800,000, saving yourself $400,000."
