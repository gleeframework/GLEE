"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:** $13,500 is still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  While a lower price is always better, there's a risk that further negotiations with Alice will break down, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations takes time and effort. Accepting Alice's offer is a reasonable way to close the deal quickly."
