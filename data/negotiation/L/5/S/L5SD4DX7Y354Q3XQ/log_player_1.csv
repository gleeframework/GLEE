{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It allows for negotiation while still leaving a good profit margin for myself.  I'm also being upfront about the value to Bob, which might encourage him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter based on his offer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can come closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
