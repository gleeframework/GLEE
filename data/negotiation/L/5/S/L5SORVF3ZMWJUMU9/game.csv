"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to buy it for $10,000, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,500?  This is a good compromise for us both, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
