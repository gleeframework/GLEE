"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly below the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $170? This offer reflects the quality and benefits you'll be receiving.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering.  I can go as low as $155, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
