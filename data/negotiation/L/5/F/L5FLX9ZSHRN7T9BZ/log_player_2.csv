"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $16,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $16,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  While our budget is $8,000, we want to aim lower to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **Respectful Tone:** We want to maintain a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $10,000? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $10,000 is still above our $8,000 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice indicated she's willing to be flexible, meaning there's likely still room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Backup Option:** We have John as a backup option, so we're not desperate to accept an offer above our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could possibly do $7,000.  That's a pretty significant increase from my side, and I think it's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $1,000, showing Alice we're willing to move, but not too drastically. 
* **Justification:** We're framing the increase as significant and emphasizing our perception of fairness.
* **Staying Below Budget:** We're still below our $8,000 budget, maintaining room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Above Budget:** $9,000 is still $1,000 over our budget, and we want to see if we can get closer to our target.
* **Alice is Negotiating:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've made good progress from her initial offer.  There's likely still some wiggle room.
* **Limited Risk:** We still have John as a backup, so we're not in a desperate position."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally honest, my budget for this is $8,000. That's the absolute most I can do. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're being transparent about our budget limit, signaling that this is our best and final offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating we're ""ready to close the deal,"" we're adding a bit of pressure and showing Alice we're serious.
* **Respectful but Firm:** We're maintaining a respectful tone but standing firm on our budget limit. 
* **John as Backup:**  We're still okay if Alice rejects this offer. We can always buy from John at $8,000."
