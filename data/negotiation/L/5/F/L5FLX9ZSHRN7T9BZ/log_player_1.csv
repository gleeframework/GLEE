"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $16,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $16,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $10,000? I'm willing to be flexible to reach a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I could possibly do $7,000.  That's a pretty significant increase from my side, and I think it's a fair offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move up. However, $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant compromise on my end."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally honest, my budget for this is $8,000. That's the absolute most I can do. If you're able to make that work, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Bob has shown his hand:** His latest message indicates $8,000 is his absolute limit. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Time is a factor:** You have fewer rounds left, and continuing to push for more could result in losing Bob without securing a better deal elsewhere.
* **Profitable Sale:** While $8,000 is less than your ideal, it's still a profit over your minimum ($12,000 value minus likely selling costs to John)."
