Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe can significantly benefit your business. My asking price is $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is closer to my desired value than Bob's. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's benefits for Bob and emphasizes a ""fair"" price rather than simply stating a number. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $400,000 gap allows for a reasonable negotiation without me having to immediately accept a low offer. 

**Plan:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll counter with a lower price, still aiming for the highest value possible.
* If he counter-offers, I'll carefully consider the offer and counter again if it's too low.
* I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall apart or become too time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While I want to maximize my profit,  $1,200,000 is well below my desired value.
* **There's room for negotiation:** I believe I can push for a higher price.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob fall apart, I can still sell to John for a much higher amount. 

**Plan:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value and potential of the product for your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my offer to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential benefits for his business, justifying the price.
* **Keep the door open:** I'm using language that encourages further discussion and a potential agreement.

**Plan:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider another counteroffer. I'm prepared to go down slightly further, but I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John. 
* If Bob accepts this offer, I've achieved a satisfactory price, considering his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, especially considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and his expressed interest in the product.
* **Selling to John is always an option:** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option.

**Plan:**

* I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000. I'll reiterate the product's value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* If Bob continues to reject, I'll weigh the potential for further negotiation against the time and effort involved. If things become too drawn out, I'll likely sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 still falls short of the value I've placed on it. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it also recognizes your desire for a fair price. I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's offer ($1,250,000), demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Finality:**  The message states this is my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Recapping Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value and potential of the product to justify the price.

**Plan:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've secured a price that's close to my minimum while still maximizing my profit.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  The negotiation has gone on for a while, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price."
