Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** While not essential in this specific scenario (since Bob values it at $120), a little justification for the price can make it feel more palatable. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
