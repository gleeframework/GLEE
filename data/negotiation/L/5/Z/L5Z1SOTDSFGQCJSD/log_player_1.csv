Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $13,000 or $13,500 is still significantly better than John's $12,000 offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob tries to negotiate. However, don't go below $12,000, as you have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
