Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go much lower than $8,500, and you have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000."
