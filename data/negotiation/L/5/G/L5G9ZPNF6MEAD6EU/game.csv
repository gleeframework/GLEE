"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what the product is worth. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,
