"Alice, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $700,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is substantial.  I could consider coming down to $925,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably manage right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This seems like a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
