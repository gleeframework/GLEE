Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $12500. How about we split the difference and go for $12250? I'm sure we can reach an agreement at this price.
