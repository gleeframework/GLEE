Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000.  While it's still a bit lower than my initial target, it's a decent profit and I'm not sure I can get a better deal through further negotiation. There's always the risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be forced to sell to John for less."
