"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm already compromising on the price. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.  I'm prepared to offer $12,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the compromise we've both made.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the product's value to me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
