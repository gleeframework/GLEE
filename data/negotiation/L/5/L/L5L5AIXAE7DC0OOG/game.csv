"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you at a special price of $11,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to meet at least $10,000. I'm thinking we can do $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm serious about buying this, but I have a budget.  $10,000 is really my limit.  Take it or leave it.",10000.0,Bob,6,
