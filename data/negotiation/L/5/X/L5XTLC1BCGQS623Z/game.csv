"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $900,000 is a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I think we are getting closer. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence! $975,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we compromise at $1,025,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $1,000,000 even?  This way we both walk away happy.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
