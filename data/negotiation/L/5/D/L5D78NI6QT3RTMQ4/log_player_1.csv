"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'll keep in mind the minimum I'm willing to accept ($8,000) and John's offer as a safety net. Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a bit closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and John's offer.  I don't want to risk going further and potentially ending up with nothing. It's better to secure the sale now and get a decent profit."
