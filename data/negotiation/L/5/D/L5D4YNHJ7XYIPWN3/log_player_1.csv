Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit margin.  I'll see how Bob responds before deciding whether to adjust my offer or go with John's guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $100. While it's better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum price, and hopefully attractive enough to Bob to keep negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $115. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's $120 offer, especially since Bob seems willing to pay almost that much."
