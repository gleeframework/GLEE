"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$6,000 is significantly less than my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to offer my minimum price to Bob.  I think this is a fair offer given that I'm willing to sell to John for this price.  Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $10,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully incentivizes him to come closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum, and I'm getting tired of this back-and-forth. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is a sure thing at $12,000."
