"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I need at least $1,000,000 for this product, so I'm starting high.
* **Bob's value:** Knowing Bob values it at $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:** I have a backup option with John, but I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **First offer strategy:**  A bold first offer can establish my negotiating position and force Bob to make a counteroffer, revealing his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $1,200,000 is lower than my desired price, but it's closer to my minimum.
* **My minimum:**  I still need at least $1,000,000, so I'm not willing to settle yet.
* **Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, I'm willing to risk it for a higher price. 
* **Next steps:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $1,200,000 is still a bit too low, but it shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **My target:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.
* **Compromise:** $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **John's offer:** While I still have the option to sell to John, I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.

This counteroffer gives Bob a clear indication that I'm flexible but still aiming for a higher price. I'm hopeful that this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $1,300,000 is now very close to my desired price and well above my minimum requirement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a higher price, the risk of further negotiation is significant. 
* **John's offer:**  I have the guaranteed $1,000,000 with John, but Bob's offer is a substantial increase.
* **Closing the deal:**  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal.

Given the circumstances, it's a smart move to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
