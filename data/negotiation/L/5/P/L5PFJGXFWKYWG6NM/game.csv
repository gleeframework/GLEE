"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $10,000 price point.

"I understand your desire to keep costs down, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $11,000 price point. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my desired profit. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still pushing to save as much as possible, though. How about $11,250? That's a fair compromise between our last offers and gets us very close to closing the deal.  What do you say?",11250.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $11,250 price point. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
