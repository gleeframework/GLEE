"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $900000. Considering your offer of $750000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $800250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",800250.0,Alice,5,
