Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment, but $10,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price once you see all it can do for you.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm on a price well above my $8,000 limit. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly from $14,500.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for a guaranteed good deal."
