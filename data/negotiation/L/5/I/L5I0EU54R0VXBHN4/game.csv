"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment, but $10,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price once you see all it can do for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,500.  This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",14500.0,Alice,5,
