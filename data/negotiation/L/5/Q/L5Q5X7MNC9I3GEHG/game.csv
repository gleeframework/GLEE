"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $82.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78?",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $78 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $80.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",80.5,Alice,5,
