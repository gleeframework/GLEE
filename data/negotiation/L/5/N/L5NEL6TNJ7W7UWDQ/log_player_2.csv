You can do better than $950,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."

I'm offering $850,000, which is still above your maximum budget but closer to what I'm willing to pay.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but it also shows I'm serious about buying the product."

I'm going to offer $875,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to go up from my previous offer but still staying below Alice's current price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Alice to accept."

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is within my budget. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure I'll get a better price, and it's getting close to my maximum. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product without risking losing it to another buyer."
