# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,750. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and at $8,750, we're getting a good deal compared to John's $12,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome and could risk losing the deal altogether."
