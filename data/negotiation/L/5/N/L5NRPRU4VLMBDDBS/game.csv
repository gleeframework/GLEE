"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $8,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on the deal. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,750. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",8750.0,Alice,5,
