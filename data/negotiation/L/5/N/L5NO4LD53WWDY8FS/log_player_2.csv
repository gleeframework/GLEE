Round 3

Alice is coming down slowly, but we're still above John's price. We are getting close to the end of negotiations where we may have to choose between her last offer and John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, I have another offer for $8,000.  To make a deal with you, I'd need you to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $7,750?"",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. It's time to start putting a little pressure on Alice by revealing that we have an alternative option.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer is essentially splitting the difference between her last offer ($8,250) and our previous counteroffer ($7,500). This can signal that we're willing to compromise but still want a significant discount. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** We are still leaving some room to negotiate up to our $8,000 limit if Alice completely rejects this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. Considering the value you're seeking, I am willing to adjust my price to $7,900 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Beating John's Price:** Alice's offer of $7,900 is finally below John's price of $8,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. We've successfully negotiated a significant discount.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have a few rounds left, but the potential savings from further negotiation are small compared to the risk of Alice not budging."
