Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $150. It's a fantastic deal you won't want to miss!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $150 offers a potential 25% profit margin if Bob accepts.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the goal is to get $150, this initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob if he counter-offers. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
