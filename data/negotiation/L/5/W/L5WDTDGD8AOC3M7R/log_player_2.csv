"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and $900,000 is more than your maximum budget.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is an option, but not the best one right now.**  While John's price is your limit, you might be able to get a better deal with Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting low:** I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to create room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $750,000 is still within my budget, and it leaves room for a compromise.
* **Building a baseline:** This counteroffer establishes a starting point for negotiations, and I'll adjust my offers based on Alice's responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to my budget, I'm still aiming to save more money. 
* **Rejecting allows further negotiation.**  By rejecting, I can continue to try and push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option, but not yet the best move.**  I'm hopeful that I can get a better deal with Alice by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  While $800,000 is my limit, I'm hoping Alice will accept it, as she's already lowered her offer. 
* **Preparing for John:**  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll proceed to buy from John, as I've reached my limit."
