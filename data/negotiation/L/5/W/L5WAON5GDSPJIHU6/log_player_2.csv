"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm willing to offer $650,000.  I think that's a fair deal that leaves us both with some benefit."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly lower than your target. This gives room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (even if simple) makes your counter-offer seem more considered."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This still reflects the significant benefits the product offers and leaves room for a profitable venture on your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down, but $975,000 is still significantly higher than your $800,000 walk-away point and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are several rounds left, indicating space to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair return, and I believe this product has potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This represents a significant investment on my part while still acknowledging the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** This counter-offer is your maximum acceptable price (and John's offer).  
* **Signal of Seriousness:** By moving directly to your target, you signal seriousness and a desire to close the deal.
* **Leaving No Money on the Table:** While there's a chance Alice might accept a slightly lower price, you risk her walking away if you go too low too quickly. This offer aims to secure the best possible deal without jeopardizing the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer. 
* **Above Budget:**  $900,000 is still above your $800,000 limit and what John is offering. 
* **No Guarantee of Further Movement:** Continuing the negotiation has no guarantee of success. Alice has shown a willingness to walk away, and you risk losing John's guaranteed offer. 

It's time to secure the product at your target price from John."
