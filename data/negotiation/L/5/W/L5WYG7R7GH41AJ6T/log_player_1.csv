I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price that's higher than what he's willing to pay, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This will allow for some room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product for $14,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'd rather secure a guaranteed sale with John at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
