"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $950,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $925,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a fair compromise. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",940000.0,Alice,5,
