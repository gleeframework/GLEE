"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
