"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a bit more, while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $160.  While it's not my ideal price, it's better than my minimum and we're getting close to a deal.  I don't want to risk losing him entirely and having to settle for John's $150."
