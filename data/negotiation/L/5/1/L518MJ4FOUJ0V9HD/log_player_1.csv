Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
