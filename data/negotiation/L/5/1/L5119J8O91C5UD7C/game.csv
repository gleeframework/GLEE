"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $10,250, which would be $10,875. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,7,
