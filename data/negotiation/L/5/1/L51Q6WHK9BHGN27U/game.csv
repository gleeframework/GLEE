"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you significant value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
