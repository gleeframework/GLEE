""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Considering its unique benefits, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential it holds."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's important to demonstrate that we're serious about finding a fair price, but not so quickly that we undervalue the product. We will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still far out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This represents a substantial commitment from me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at a very low price.  We need to signal we're willing to walk away if he won't move significantly. We will counter, but we're getting closer to John's offer being the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront.  While I'm open to negotiation, the gap between our valuations is too large. I'm willing to consider $1,750,000 - this is a significant move on my part. However, if we can't find agreement at this level, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I understand you need to consider other options, but I believe $850,000 represents a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to stick with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is not budging, and we're now getting dangerously close to our walk-away point.  We'll send one more counteroffer to signal there's a small window left, but John is looking more appealing by the round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered.
