,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still acknowledging the value this product holds.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still far out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This represents a substantial commitment from me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront.  While I'm open to negotiation, the gap between our valuations is too large. I'm willing to consider $1,750,000 - this is a significant move on my part. However, if we can't find agreement at this level, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I understand you need to consider other options, but I believe $850,000 represents a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to stick with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, this is my final offer. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for the product. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. However, I need to be clear: if this offer isn't acceptable, I will be moving forward with other opportunities.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
