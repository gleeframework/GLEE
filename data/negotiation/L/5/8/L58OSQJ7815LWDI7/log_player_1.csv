Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows for negotiation and the potential to secure a higher profit margin than selling directly to John.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message frames the offer as exclusive and emphasizes the product's value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. Even if Bob counter-offers, Alice is likely to land on a price higher than $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a small risk of Bob rejecting the offer and having to sell to John at $15,000."
