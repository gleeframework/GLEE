Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't commit to $9,500. I'm willing to pay up to $8,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to try to get closer to my target price. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but I'll see if I can negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my target, $8,800 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm hopeful that I can get Bob to come up a bit more, but I'm also aware that I have limited rounds left before I have to consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still too far off from what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $9,200.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9200}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting closer to my goal, but I'm not ready to settle for $8,900. I have a few more rounds to try and get him to come up to a price that's more comfortable for me. I'm also concerned that if I sell to Bob now, I'll be regretting it later when I realize I could have gotten a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to pay $8,950 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We're running out of rounds, and while Bob has come up a little, his offer is still below my minimum. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John. It's time to move on!"
