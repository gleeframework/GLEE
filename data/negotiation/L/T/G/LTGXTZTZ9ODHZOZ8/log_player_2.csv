# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,000 is more than his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product from John for $8,000, which is a better deal than $8,500.  While a counteroffer might work, there's no guarantee Alice will accept it, and it risks delaying the purchase.  Since John is offering a better price, it's the safest option."
