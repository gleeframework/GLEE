Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $150,  I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Considering Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values the product at $100, I don't want to start too close to that amount, as it might make him less likely to negotiate upwards.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own stated value for the product. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. It's clear there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $75 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** By reducing my price from $150 to $130, I signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Still Aiming High:** While I'm open to negotiation, I don't want to concede too much ground too quickly.  $130 is still a substantial profit margin and leaves room for further bargaining if needed.
* **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** By proposing $130, I'm aiming to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired range, hopefully above his initial offer of $75."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $75 is quite low.  I could meet you halfway at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's no guarantee Bob would be willing to go higher, and I risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I get a fair price for the product."
