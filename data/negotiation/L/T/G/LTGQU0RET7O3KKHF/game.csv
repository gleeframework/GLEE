"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10500?  This is a fair price that allows me to continue negotiating with you and gives you a great deal on a valuable product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800 for the product?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9800 is getting closer, it's still just a bit short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $10000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
