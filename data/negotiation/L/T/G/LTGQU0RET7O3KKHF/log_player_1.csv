{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  It's well below his perceived value of the product. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially go higher if Bob rejects your offer.

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, you increase your chances of securing a good deal while still being open to a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and what you could potentially get from John.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Continue negotiating with Bob:**  There's still a chance you can get closer to your desired price.
* **Show Bob you're serious about your value:** This demonstrates that you won't settle for just any price. 

You can make a counteroffer closer to your initial price to see if Bob is willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This is a fair price that allows me to continue negotiating with you and gives you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to sell to Bob right now.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Keep the negotiation going:** You might be able to get a higher price with another counteroffer.
* **Avoid selling too low:**  You still have the option of selling to John for a much better price. 

It's time to make a counteroffer that shows you're still serious about your value, but also willing to compromise slightly."
