"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a good deal for myself. Would you be willing to consider this price?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low.
