Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do see value in the product, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum but still  considerably more than John's offer.  There's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While we could push for a bit more, $11,000 is a strong offer and well above our minimum. It's better to secure the deal now.
