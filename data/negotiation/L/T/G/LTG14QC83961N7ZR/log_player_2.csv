"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high, close to your maximum budget. There's a good chance to negotiate a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do see value in the product, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and establish a lower price point early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice moved down in price, which is a good sign, but we're still significantly above her value. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a better deal."
