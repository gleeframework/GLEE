"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $8,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,800. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $8,000.  While $7,800 is tempting, I'm going to counter with a price closer to my target.  I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is my final offer, as I'm really hoping to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're close, Alice! However, I was thinking I could get it for a bit lower. How about $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've made several concessions and we're only $100 apart.  However, it's getting late in the negotiations and I'm running out of time.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's safer to sell to him and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my final offer."
