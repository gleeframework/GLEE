"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting at a price of $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it holds, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $8000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counteroffer at $12000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product offers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget constraints still limit me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $13000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, but I'm still unable to meet you at $13000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $12500. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12500, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've thought about it and am willing to go up to $13000 for the product. I hope this is within your acceptable range.",13000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $13000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
