"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is likely worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment and shows my genuine interest.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product to your business is significant and I can't quite let it go for that price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While she's lowered her price, it's still well above Bob's initial offer and closer to John's price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $885,000. This price reflects a significant investment from my end and shows my commitment to this deal. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's getting closer.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can secure a lower price. It's important to remember that John's offer is still a backup option if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $890,000, which is a substantial investment and shows my strong interest in this product.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
