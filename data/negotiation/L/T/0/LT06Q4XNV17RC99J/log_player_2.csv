"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, Bob. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above my maximum budget of $80. While it's closer, I'm still better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate. I'll try to get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable paying $95, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $95 is still below my minimum. Let's try to meet each other in the middle again. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my maximum budget of $80.  While we're getting closer, it seems like the negotiation is getting stuck.  It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80, as I'm guaranteed to get it at a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already rejected multiple offers, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $100, which is still too high for me."
