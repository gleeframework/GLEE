Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) while ensuring he accepts the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $110 leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Starting too low (e.g., $90) might make Bob suspicious or feel like he can get away with a much lower price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $80 guarantees Alice won't be left with nothing if Bob declines."
