# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $950,000 is still quite a distance from what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a workable price.  However, the gap between $975,000 and my bottom line is still too significant. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,012,500.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product brings. Let me know your thoughts.

I've already made a serious offer of $975,000, and I think that's a fair price. Since Alice's new offer is not significantly lower, I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800,000 might be the best option.
