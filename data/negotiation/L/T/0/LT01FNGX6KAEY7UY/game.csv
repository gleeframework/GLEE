"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $8100 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $7500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Bob,6,
