"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but also reflects the product's value to me.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's interested and to gauge how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $80, I'm going to try to get a little more. Bob's offer is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm going to see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold and closer to my initial asking price than his first offer.  I'm happy to accept this and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
