Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to confidently negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $850,000?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even below the value of the product to Bob ($800,000).  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation potential:** While I could counteroffer, there's a risk Bob might not budge further, and the negotiation could stall. It's safer to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a great price for you, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within reason:**  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a clear minimum.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:**  Emphasizing that this price is a ""great price"" for him reinforces the perceived value and incentivizes acceptance.
* **Finding a solution:** The message focuses on finding a ""solution"" that works for both, promoting a collaborative tone.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price still leaves room for further negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer, while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a considerable distance away and significantly below the value I place on the product.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks dragging out the process and potentially ending up with a lower final price than I'm comfortable with.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, providing a secure and profitable outcome.  

Considering the risks of further negotiation and the certainty of a good outcome with John, selling to John is the most strategic decision."
