"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I'm thinking of a price of $20000 for it. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is far outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Is this something you'd be interested in?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $16000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12000? I'm confident we can close a deal at that price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm thinking of a price of $14500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $14500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that satisfies both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $13500, which is just $500 above your latest offer. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay for the product?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to have to stick to my offer of $13000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.  If not, I'll have to go with another option.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I'm making a final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
