Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. Bob is incrementing his offers by $25,000 each round. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Bob has stopped increasing his offer amounts.  It's unlikely he will go much higher. Accepting his offer of $850,000 is the best decision to maximize profit at this point."
