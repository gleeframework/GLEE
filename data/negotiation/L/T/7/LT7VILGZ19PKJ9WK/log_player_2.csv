{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see how Alice reacts.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully sets the stage for further negotiation."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is trying to push the price up. It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  While $920,000 is closer to my limit, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is a good compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest price."

Alice seems to be sticking to her initial offer. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering the alternative."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her original offer.  If she rejects this, I'll likely move on to John, as we're getting close to my limit."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stubborn and not willing to budge much.  We're getting close to my limit, and with only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely. I'll buy from John, as it's a known price and guarantees I get the product."
