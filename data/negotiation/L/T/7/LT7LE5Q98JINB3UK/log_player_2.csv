# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You want to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have multiple rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value this product holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. You have several rounds left, and you can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth trying to push for a lower offer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the potential value of this product, I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price that works for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $1,020,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $1,020,000, which is still above your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, you've already reached a point where you're not likely to get much lower.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, so it's more financially beneficial to accept his offer."
