Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a fair price considering its quality and rarity.,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $90 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get close to the price I'm comfortable with, but $110 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay $95, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a small increase, but it's still a good compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if we're going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $95. I'm willing to make one final offer of $95. If you can accept this, I'd be happy to make a deal.",95.0,Bob,8,
