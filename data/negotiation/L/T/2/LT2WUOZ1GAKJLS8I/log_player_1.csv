Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that your asking price is justified.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Letting Bob know you have another buyer (even without mentioning John specifically) creates a sense of urgency and competition. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always lower your price slightly, but remember your bottom line is $15,000."
