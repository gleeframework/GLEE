{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should offer the absolute minimum he's willing to pay, which is $12,000. He knows John will sell it to him for that price, so there's no reason to go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can still get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept anything higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should counter with $13,000. This is a slight increase from his initial offer, showing he's willing to negotiate but still keeping the price lower than what Alice is offering. It leaves some room for Alice to counter if she wants to, but it's still well within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. He can secure the product for his target price from John, so there's no reason to risk going higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should offer $14,000. He's been consistent in his counteroffers, slowly increasing his price to show he's willing to negotiate. This offer is still below Alice's latest price, but closer to a potential compromise. It also leaves room for Alice to counter if she's willing to drop her price further. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can go to John and buy the product for his target price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. 

Alice's price keeps dropping but it is still above Bob's budget. There is no guarantee that Alice will agree to Bob's next counteroffer and it is a risk to continue negotiating.  John offers a guaranteed deal for Bob's desired price."
