Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,""  you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply that Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act now.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" keeps the conversation open and invites Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potentially mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net, aiming higher with Bob is strategically sound. You can always negotiate down to $12,000 with Bob if needed, ensuring you don't leave money on the table."
