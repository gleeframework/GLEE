"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","While $18,000 is significantly less than my initial ask, it's still a substantial profit over my minimum. I'll counter, but I'm also keeping John in mind if the negotiation drags on. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, $18,000 is a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is clearly very interested and is slowly moving towards my price. While I could push for a bit more, accepting $19,000 guarantees a good profit without risking the deal with Bob falling through entirely."
