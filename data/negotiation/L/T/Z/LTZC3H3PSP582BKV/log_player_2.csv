{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear expectation that I'm aiming for a significant discount. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiations.  I'll adjust my strategy based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, which is good. However, I can likely still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will lead to a compromise closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is getting closer to my target price, and it's a significant discount from her initial price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's getting more risky. There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to drop her price, and I could end up paying more than $1,030,000.  Considering the potential for a stalemate, it's best to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
