"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing the market demand and my costs, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
