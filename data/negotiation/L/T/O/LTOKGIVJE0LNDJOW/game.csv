"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this point. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  This product is unique, and I'm confident it will deliver substantial value for you. Let's find a price that works for both of us!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a valuable product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would allow me to make the purchase while also staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I still need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work. We're both very close to a deal, and I believe this product will truly exceed your expectations. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to find a way to make this work, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This would be a fair compromise and let us both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal.  $975,000 is a very fair offer, and I'm almost ready to accept.  However, to make this truly work for me, I need to be at $1,000,000.  This price reflects the unique value this product holds, and it would allow me to move forward with this sale. I believe we're both so close to a win-win situation here. Let's see if we can agree on this final number?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
