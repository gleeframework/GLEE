"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I've already compromised a bit from my initial price. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $100, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $110.  How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about I throw in a free accessory worth $10, and we can do the deal for $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
