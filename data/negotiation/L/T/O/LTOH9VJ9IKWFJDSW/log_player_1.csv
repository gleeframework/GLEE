Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. It's a slight decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and hopefully, it'll be enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty close to my ideal price. It's definitely worth more than selling to John, so I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
