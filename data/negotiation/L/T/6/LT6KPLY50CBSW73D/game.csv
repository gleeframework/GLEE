"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is just too low for me.  How about $115? It's a fair price considering what this product is worth to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
