"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to give you a bit of a discount, but I still need to make a profit.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Would you be willing to settle at $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one last push. I can meet you at $12,500. It's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,7,
