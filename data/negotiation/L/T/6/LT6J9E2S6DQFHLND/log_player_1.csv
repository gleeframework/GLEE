{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $11,500, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Not too high:**  It's also below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, making it a potentially attractive offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message conveys I'm open to discussion, which is important for building a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price of $11,500. 
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to stand my ground. This could potentially lead Bob to offer a higher price in the next round.
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option,  I'm willing to take the risk of further negotiation to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** By suggesting a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not completely conceding, but offering a smaller compromise keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Positive framing:**  My message emphasizes a fair price for *both* of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $10,800 is only $200 away from my desired price of $11,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk of Bob backing out or John potentially making a higher offer than $10,000 if I stall too long.
* **Maximizing profit:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale at a price significantly higher than what I'd receive from John. It's a good compromise that balances potential gains with the risk of a deal falling through."
