Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Strong Incentive:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and positions the offer as a time-sensitive deal, encouraging him to act quickly.

By aiming high but staying realistic, this offer increases the chances of Alice securing a price significantly higher than her fallback option of $10,000 from John."
