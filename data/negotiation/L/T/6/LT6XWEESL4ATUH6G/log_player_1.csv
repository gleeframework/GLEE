Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price slightly above my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm willing to push for a slightly higher price. I can still get a better deal than selling to John, and I want to see if I can convince Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? This would still give you a good deal, and I wouldn't have to sell to John."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum price and still leaves some profit for me. It's not worth risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
