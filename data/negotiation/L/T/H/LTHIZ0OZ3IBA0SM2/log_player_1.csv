Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
