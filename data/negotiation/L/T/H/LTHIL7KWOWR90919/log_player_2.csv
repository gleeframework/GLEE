It's always worth exploring options, and $750,000 is a good starting point but not necessarily the best deal.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within the range of what the product is worth to me.  We'll see if Alice is willing to budge."

I'm going to raise my counteroffer slightly to $650,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not willing to accept her full price. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful negotiation in the next round."

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's try one more counteroffer before we have to make a more serious decision."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer and counter with $675,000. This shows good faith while still staying within my budget. If she rejects this, I might have to consider buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stuck on her price, and I'm not willing to go any higher. While it's a shame to not get a better deal, I'm running out of time and the risk of failing to get the product at all is too high. I'm going to buy from John to guarantee I have the product."
