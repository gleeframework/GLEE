"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a good price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $100. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me closer to my target price.  I think this will encourage Bob to accept, as he's already shown a willingness to go up from $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $92, which is close enough to my desired price and a better deal than selling to John for $80. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
