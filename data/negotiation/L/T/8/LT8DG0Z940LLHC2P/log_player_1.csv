Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise: 

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making $200,000 more than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **It's lower than Bob's valuation:** Bob still gets a $200,000 discount on his perceived value.

This approach maximizes your chances of securing a sale with Bob while still getting a good price. If he rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer."
