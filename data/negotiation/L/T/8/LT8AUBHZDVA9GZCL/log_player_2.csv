"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really value. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $100, which is still within my budget of $100, and I'd be saving $5 by buying from John.
