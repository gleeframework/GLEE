"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I capture a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I believe I can secure a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a profit while showing flexibility to Bob. I believe this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still within a reasonable range for me.  I'll accept his offer to close the deal and secure a good profit."
