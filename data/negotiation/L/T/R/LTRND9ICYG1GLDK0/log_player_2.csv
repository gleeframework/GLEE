# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth $12,000 to you, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
