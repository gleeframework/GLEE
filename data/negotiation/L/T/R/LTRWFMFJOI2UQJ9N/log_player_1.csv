"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this truly valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justifying the Price:** By highlighting the ""true worth"" and ""benefits,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of value at a high point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $2,000,000 offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, allowing space to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's time to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects a more accurate assessment of its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Justification:**  By politely rejecting Bob's offer and providing a reason, I'm establishing that his initial valuation was too low.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** The $250,000 decrease from my initial offer signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Anchoring to My Value:** By emphasizing the ""true worth,"" I'm keeping Bob's focus on a higher valuation, closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my $1,500,000 minimum. However, he's clearly showing more willingness to negotiate.  There's room to bargain further and potentially reach a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me.  To show my commitment to making this work, I'll come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Starting by recognizing we're getting closer helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Smaller Concession:** My price reduction this round is smaller ($150,000) than the previous one, signaling I'm reaching the limit of what I'm willing to concede.
* **Finality and Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this offer is a significant move on my part and framing it as a win-win solution to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I feel like we're close to a deal.  While $1,600,000 is closer, I can't justify going that high. Could we settle at $1,350,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point.  Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum price. However, $1,350,000 is still a $150,000 difference. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer in hopes that he'll meet me closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're absolutely right, we are very close! I appreciate you recognizing the fairness I'm offering. How about this: let's split the difference and call it a deal at $1,425,000. That reflects a willingness to compromise from both of us and gets this valuable product into your hands."",
""product_price"": 1425000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm starting by agreeing with Bob and reinforcing that we're nearing a deal. 
* **Splitting the Difference Tactic:**  This classic negotiation technique makes the offer seem very appealing, as it appears to offer equal concessions from both sides.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm implying that this is a final offer by framing it as the solution to close the deal now. 
* **Positioning:**  This offer is only slightly above my absolute minimum, increasing the likelihood Bob will see it as a win and accept."
