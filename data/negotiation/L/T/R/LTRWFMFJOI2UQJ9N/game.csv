"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this truly valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects a more accurate assessment of its true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me.  To show my commitment to making this work, I'll come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I feel like we're close to a deal.  While $1,600,000 is closer, I can't justify going that high. Could we settle at $1,350,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're absolutely right, we are very close! I appreciate you recognizing the fairness I'm offering. How about this: let's split the difference and call it a deal at $1,425,000. That reflects a willingness to compromise from both of us and gets this valuable product into your hands.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
