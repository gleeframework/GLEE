{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price.  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This is still a good profit for me and I believe it is closer to a price that Bob might be willing to accept.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will get us closer to a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial target. I'm confident that I can get a slightly higher price with one more round of negotiation.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $12,500, which is a significant compromise but still allows me to make a decent profit. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm ready to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire. Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk going another round and potentially getting a worse offer.  I'm confident that selling to John is the best option to ensure I get a decent profit and avoid further negotiation."
