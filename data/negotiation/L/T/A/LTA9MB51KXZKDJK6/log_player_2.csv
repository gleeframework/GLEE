{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above your budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, you only have one round left.  It's wiser to take the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept your counteroffer in the final round, and you risk losing the product altogether."
