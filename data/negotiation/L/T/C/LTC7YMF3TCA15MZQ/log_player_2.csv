"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After considering your interest and the market value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price that I believe reflects the product's true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice is selling it for $900,000. This means you'll save $300,000 by accepting her offer.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal.** While you might try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.  It's better to secure this deal and save the $300,000."
