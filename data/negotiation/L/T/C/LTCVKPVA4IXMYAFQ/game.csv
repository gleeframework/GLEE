"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $92.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference again. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $90. Is that a price you're comfortable with?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to offer $87.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. ",87.0,Bob,6,
