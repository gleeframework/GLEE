Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, giving Bob room to negotiate. However, it's still below Bob's perceived value, making the offer attractive to him.  

This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open a negotiation if he's willing to counteroffer. If he rejects, I can either adjust my offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum of $8,000, and while not as high as my initial offer, it's still a profitable deal.  It's also likely that further negotiation would result in only a small increase in price, so accepting his offer is the most logical choice."
