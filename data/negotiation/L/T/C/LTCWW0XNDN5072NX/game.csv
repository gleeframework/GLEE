"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still well above my minimum. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we try $1,250,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
