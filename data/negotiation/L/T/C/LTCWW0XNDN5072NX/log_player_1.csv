Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That feels like a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is still a good deal, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we try $1,250,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's well above my minimum, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
