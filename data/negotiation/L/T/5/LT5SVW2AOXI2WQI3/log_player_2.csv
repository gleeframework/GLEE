"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
