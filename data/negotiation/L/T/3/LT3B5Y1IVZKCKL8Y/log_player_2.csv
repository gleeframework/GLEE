"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to explore if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still not within Bob's ideal range. There's still some room for negotiation, so rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'm offering $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is favorable:** While Bob's ideal price was $1,000,000, Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 he'd pay John. 
* **Risk of escalation:**  Further negotiation could risk Alice walking away or potentially increasing the price again.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of running out of time."
