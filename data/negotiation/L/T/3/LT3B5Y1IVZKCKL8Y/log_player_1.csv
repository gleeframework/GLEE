"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from Bob's estimated value, but still leaves plenty of room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, it's still below my minimum of $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still rounds left, so I have time to work with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is close to my minimum, I still want to try and squeeze out a bit more profit. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price and see if Bob is willing to meet in the middle. There's still time and I don't want to sell too low if I can avoid it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'm offering $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
