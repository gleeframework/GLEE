"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a significant discount while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'm offering $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,
