"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's  above my minimum threshold of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $105.  While it's above John's offer of $100, it's still below my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's last offer, and hopefully we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $102 is better than John's offer of $100, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round, as there are still several rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

I'm countering with $108.  We're getting close to a compromise, and I think this price is fair considering our previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $103.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and while it's not my ideal price, it's better than John's offer and a decent outcome."
