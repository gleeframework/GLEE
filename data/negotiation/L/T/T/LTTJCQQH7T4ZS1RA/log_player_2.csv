"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price or buy it from John for $80 if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?"", 
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's asking price. Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying within our budget.
* **Polite and Interested:** We want to keep the negotiation going and signal that we are serious about buying, just not at the initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $90, which is my lowest price for this product. Would you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is better than the initial offer, it's still above our target price and Alice indicated a willingness to negotiate. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:** We know we have a backup option at $80, which gives us some leverage to push for a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, $80 is the highest I can go for this. If that works, I'm ready to buy right now."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at our maximum price but being clear that this is our limit. This avoids unnecessary back and forth.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating we're ready to buy ""right now,"" we add a bit of pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Leveraging John's Offer (Implicitly):** We're not explicitly mentioning John, but by offering our absolute max, Alice might infer we have an alternative option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I think I can do a bit better. How about $85? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While $85 is slightly above our target, it's a reasonable compromise and better than John's $80 offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled this is her best price. Further haggling is unlikely to result in a better deal. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations for a small difference in price."
