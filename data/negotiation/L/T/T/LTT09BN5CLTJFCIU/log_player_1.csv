Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. It's a steal at this price!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while ensuring he's more likely to accept than reject.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob declines, we have a guaranteed sale at $120.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 makes it appealing to Bob (as it's below his perceived value) while leaving room for a small profit above John's offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
