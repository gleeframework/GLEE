Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room for negotiation.
* **Motivating Bob:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential profit he can make.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm keeping the option to sell to John open if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself. I'll aim to gradually decrease my price, while still keeping it above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, it's still not a deal I'm willing to accept right now.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $800,000, which indicates some potential for compromise.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm still hoping to get a better price through negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $900,000 and my initial offer of $1,400,000. I'll try to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is too low for me to accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make some progress towards my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm aiming for a price in the middle between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, reminding him that $1,200,000 is still a good deal for him, considering his initial valuation of $800,000.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not accepting his offer outright, keeping the negotiation open and suggesting there's still room for some back and forth. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent!  We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. If his offers continue to be significantly below my target, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,000,000 is still significantly below my desired price of $1,500,000. I'm not yet ready to accept such a low offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation of $800,000.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I believe I can still achieve a better price through negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price higher than $1,000,000 but lower than my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my target price."

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer brings me closer to Bob's offer, creating a smaller gap that might encourage him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! We've reached an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has come closer to my desired price,  $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems we've reached an impasse.  Bob's offers consistently fall short of my minimum. 
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  I'll contact John and finalize the sale, ensuring I receive $1,500,000 for the product."
