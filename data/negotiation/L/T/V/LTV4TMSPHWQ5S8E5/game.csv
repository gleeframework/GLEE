"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is too low for me to accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make some progress towards my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, to show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
