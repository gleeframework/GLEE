"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is considerably higher than similar items on the market, and  $1,050,000 doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
