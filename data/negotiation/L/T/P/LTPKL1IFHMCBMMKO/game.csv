"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? ",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
