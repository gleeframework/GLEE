Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. Its inherent worth is substantial, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob is worthwhile. The potential gain from a successful negotiation outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer. 
* **Perceived Value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than my minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob is highly price-sensitive, he might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of a significantly higher sale price makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
