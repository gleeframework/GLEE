"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
