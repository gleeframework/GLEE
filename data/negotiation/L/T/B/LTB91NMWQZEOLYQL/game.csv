"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my current budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value this product brings is truly significant, and I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a wise investment at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a bit stretched at $1,100,000, but I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is my absolute limit, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
