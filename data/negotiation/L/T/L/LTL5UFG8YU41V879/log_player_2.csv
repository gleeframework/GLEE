"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not even worth negotiating with her at this point.  You should immediately reject her offer and explore either counter-offering or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is still a very competitive price given the potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than my budget of $1,000,000.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'll need to see a more substantial reduction before I'll consider accepting.  I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,600,000 is still above my budget. While it's a lower price than her previous offers, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us. I'm going to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as it's the most cost-effective option for me."
