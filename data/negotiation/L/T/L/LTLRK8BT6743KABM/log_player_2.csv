"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $10,500? It's a great deal for a product you value at $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above your ideal price, but it's a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  It's also worth noting that Alice is willing to negotiate, indicating a potential for further price reduction in the future.  At this point, it's better to secure the product for a slightly higher than expected price, rather than risk losing the product to John."
