"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider $10,500? It's a great deal for a product you value at $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
