I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 through negotiation.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to evaluate his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal through further negotiation. I'm confident I can convince Bob to pay closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm dropping the price to $1,850,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  It seems we can't agree on a price.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially losing more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I meet my minimum price and don't risk getting stuck with a lower offer."
