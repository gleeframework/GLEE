"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $900,000 for it. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential. I'm confident that this purchase will be a sound investment for you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. If you decline, I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a bit of a bargaining game, trying to create urgency with the mention of another buyer. However, you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. There's a chance she'll come back with a lower offer closer to her $800,000 valuation. Even if she doesn't, you can always fall back on John's offer."
