"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know the product is worth at least $800,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to my target, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I'd like to sweeten the deal by adding a $20,000 bonus on top of that. This way, you'll still get a great price, and I'll get the product at a price that works for me. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is getting closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,500,000.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,450,000.  This price would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize the transaction.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to save as much as possible. I'll offer $1,350,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1350000.0,Bob,8,
