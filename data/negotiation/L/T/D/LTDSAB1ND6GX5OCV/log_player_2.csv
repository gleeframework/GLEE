It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  Since Alice is motivated to sell (the product is worth more to her), there's a chance we can get a lower price."

{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to land somewhere in the middle between our desired prices.  Let's see if Alice is willing to budge."

We're getting closer to my target price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Let's try another counteroffer."

Round 4

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay the price John is selling for, but I'd prefer to buy from Alice if she's willing to meet me there."

Alice's offer is only $25,000 more than what John is offering. It's a reasonable price considering the potential for further negotiation if I reject."
