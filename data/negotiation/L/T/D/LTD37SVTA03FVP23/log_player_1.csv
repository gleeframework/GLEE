Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. 

Here's why:

* **Higher than your minimum:** It's $500 above your minimum acceptable price, which is good for you.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  It's lower than the value he places on the product, making it a good deal for him.
* **Minimizes risk:** While a higher price could potentially get you more money, it also increases the risk of Bob rejecting your offer.  

This strategy aims to find a sweet spot where you gain a decent profit while still encouraging Bob to accept the deal."
