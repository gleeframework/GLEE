"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. $87.50 is a good offer, but I need to make a bit more. Let's meet in the middle again at $90. It's a fair price that's a good compromise for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $88. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",88.0,Bob,6,
