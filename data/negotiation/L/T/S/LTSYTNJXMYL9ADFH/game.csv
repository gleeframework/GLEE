"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's well below what it's worth to you, and it's my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering your budget constraints. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, and $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  However, I need to make sure I get a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a very reasonable price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
