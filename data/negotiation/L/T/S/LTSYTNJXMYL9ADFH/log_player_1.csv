{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:**  You still have wiggle room to make a profit. 
* **It shows you are willing to negotiate:** This is more likely to get Bob to engage in a conversation.

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's well below what it's worth to you, and it's my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** 
* **We have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay our desired price.**  It's not worth risking a loss by accepting a significantly lower offer.

**Next steps:**

We'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to our desired value, keeping in mind we can always sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering your budget constraints. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price closer to our desired value:** This demonstrates our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.
* **Acknowledge Bob's budget constraints:**  This shows empathy and helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Frame the counteroffer as a fair price for both parties:** This emphasizes the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** We're not willing to take a significant loss just to close a deal.
* **We have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay our desired price.** This makes the risk of accepting Bob's offer even less appealing.

**Next steps:**

We'll counter Bob's offer again with a price closer to our desired value, but still showing willingness to negotiate. It's possible we'll need to make several counteroffers before reaching an agreement or deciding to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, and $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  However, I need to make sure I get a fair return on this product.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a price slightly lower than our previous offer:**  This shows continued willingness to compromise, but we're still aiming for a price closer to our desired value.
* **Emphasize the fairness of the price:** We're framing the offer as a good deal for both parties, which can increase the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Express a desire to finalize the deal:** This encourages Bob to make a decision and potentially close the negotiation.
