"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice:**  You pay $900,000, saving $600,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John:**  You pay $1,500,000.

It's always better to accept Alice's offer, even though it's not the absolute lowest possible price. You're still saving a significant amount of money."
