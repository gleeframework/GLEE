"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) than my actual budget ($80) to leave room for negotiation. This gives me space to potentially meet in the middle and still get a good deal. 
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important in negotiations. I'm directly stating my counteroffer while acknowledging Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $75 is still above my target price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate while proposing a price that's closer to her counteroffer.  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to appeal to her sense of fairness.
* **Target Price:** $70 is a good price point for me â€“ it's within my budget and offers significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $70 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $78? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:**  $78 is very close to my maximum budget of $80. 
* **Time Investment:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation. Continuing to push for a lower price (which might be rejected) could result in me paying the full $80 to John if I run out of rounds. 

It's a good deal at $78, and I'll accept to avoid the risk of missing out on the savings."
