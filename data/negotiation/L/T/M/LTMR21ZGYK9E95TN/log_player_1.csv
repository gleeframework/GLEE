"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  I'm offering a price that's below Bob's perceived value but still gives me a significant profit.
* **Opening the Dialogue:**  I'm using a friendly tone and opening the dialogue for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Profitable:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $10,000, but it's not drastically low. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  I can counteroffer with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John at $10,000 is my last resort. I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's still within my acceptable range.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but also demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The counteroffer of $13,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
