"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is still a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's still within my acceptable range.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:** At $13,000, Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better price. Alice has already shown she's willing to compromise.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob keeps rejecting offers, he risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures a decent price while minimizing the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
