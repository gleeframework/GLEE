# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering your needs. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers ready to purchase at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.
