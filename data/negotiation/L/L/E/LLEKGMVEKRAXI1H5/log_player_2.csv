"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting (saving $300,000), Bob can potentially do better.  He has a clear advantage knowing the product's value to Alice is $1,000,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay closer to the product's actual value, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for less than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay more, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to negotiate.  Alice is still willing to sell for more than her actual value ($1,000,000). Bob should continue to counteroffer, aiming to push the price lower.  It's better to try and squeeze out more savings rather than settling for a price that's still above her ideal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At this point, Bob should accept the offer.  The savings are significant compared to buying from John ($1,500,000), and Alice is still making a profit.  Continued negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John outweighs the potential small gains."
