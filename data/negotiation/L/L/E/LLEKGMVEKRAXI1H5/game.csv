"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential savings, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This is still a great deal for you considering your valuation and allows for some profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay closer to the product's actual value, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for less than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay more, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,150,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
