"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a high benchmark and leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects. It also allows me to assess his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming higher. I'm confident that I can get closer to my initial asking price by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not ready to accept $17,500. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting very close to my floor price, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. With only two rounds left, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. This is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't risk getting a worse offer from Bob in the next round."
