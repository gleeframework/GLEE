Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is quite limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and while his message suggests some flexibility, I'm not going to reach a satisfactory price this way. I'll aim closer to my minimum and see if he bites.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
