"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget is quite limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could be flexible, but I need a price closer to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm sorry but $12,000 is still quite out of my reach. I'm looking for something around $8,000. Could we perhaps find a compromise?",8000.0,Bob,4,
