I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a significant profit over the $1,000,000 I would receive from John, while still leaving room for potential negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Ambition:** I want to maximize my earnings, so I'm aiming higher than the guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Risk Assessment:**  I'm aware there's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, I'm willing to take that chance for the potential higher payout. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Offering a price that's not too high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

This strategy balances my desire for a high profit with the need to secure a sale."
