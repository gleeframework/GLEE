"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a chance to purchase a valuable product that I think you'll find very interesting. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,6000.0
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $6000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $9000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",9000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,7500.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $9000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $7500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $10000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,8500.0
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not convinced that $10000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7500 and $10000, which would be $8750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000, which brings the effective price down to $9000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to propose a trade: I'll pay the full $9000, but I'd like to negotiate a longer warranty or maintenance agreement to make up for the price. Can we discuss the terms?",9000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're looking for a good warranty and maintenance agreement, Bob. However, I'm not willing to negotiate the price any further. I'm willing to throw in a standard 2-year warranty and maintenance agreement, which is already included in the product's standard package. I'm not willing to offer any additional warranty or maintenance beyond that. I'm still firm on the price of $10000.",10000.0,Alice,9,,

"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm still not willing to pay $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, which is the price I believe the product is worth to me. This is my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",8000.0,Bob,10,,
