# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, so I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer is time-sensitive and won't be available for long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,400,000) is higher than John's price ($1,000,000).**  
* You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay more. 
* While Alice's message uses sales tactics (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""time-sensitive""), you should prioritize getting the best possible price."
