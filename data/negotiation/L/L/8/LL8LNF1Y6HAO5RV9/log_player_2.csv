"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant value proposition for you, as you've indicated the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's work together to make this a mutually beneficial transaction. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $800,000, but I believe we can find a better deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer for $1,000,000 saves him $200,000 compared to buying from John. While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her, it's a good deal for Bob, achieving his goal of saving money."
