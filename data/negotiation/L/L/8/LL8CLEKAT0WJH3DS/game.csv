"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than $90, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $90. Let's see if we can make a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on a good deal. Can we meet at $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is closer, but still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! I can see you're making a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $92.50, so how about we go with $97.50?",97.5,Alice,7,
