"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I appreciate you moving down in price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,200? I feel that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,200 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8000.0,Alice,5,
