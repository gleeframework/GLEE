"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious starting point:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's willingness to move down from her initial price. 
* **Polite and interested:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and expresses genuine interest in the product.

This counteroffer aims to understand Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to negotiate significantly, we can likely reach a deal well below John's $8,000 offer. However, if she's firm on a price close to $10,000, we can consider buying from John later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $8,500 is still higher than John's $8,000 offer.  We've successfully brought her down from $10,000, so there's still room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer, pushing for a price closer to $7,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I appreciate you moving down in price. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,200? I feel that would be a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** We're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. Alice came down $1,500, so we're countering with a decrease of $1,300.
* **Staying above John's price:** Our offer of $7,200 keeps us below John's $8,000 price, providing leverage in case Alice is unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Positive and respectful:** We acknowledge Alice's compromise and maintain a collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly.

This counteroffer tests Alice's flexibility further. If she's willing to go below $8,000, there's a good chance we can secure the product at a price lower than John's. If she remains firm above $8,000, we can then decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or taking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,200 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our bottom line. It's unlikely we'll get a better price from her, and John's offer is also $8,000. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at the best possible price."
