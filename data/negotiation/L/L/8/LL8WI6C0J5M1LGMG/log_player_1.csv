Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is below my minimum, and I'm confident we can find a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is too low for me.  I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,000?  This is still a great price for the value of the product, and it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer. How about $12,500? That's a fair price for the value of this product, and it allows us to both move forward. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about we settle on $12000?  It's a small step down from your offer, but it would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum, but I've already been through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned we might not reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's safer to sell to him now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
