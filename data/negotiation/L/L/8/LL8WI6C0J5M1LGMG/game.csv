"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10000 is too low for me.  I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13000?  This is still a great price for the value of the product, and it's fair to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both save some money.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offer. How about $12500? That's a fair price for the value of this product, and it allows us to both move forward. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about we settle on $12000?  It's a small step down from your offer, but it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",12000.0,Bob,6,
