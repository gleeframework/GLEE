"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still gives you a great value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,000. This is a good deal for Bob. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might increase her offer again, or Bob might end up buying from John for $10,000.  $9,000 is a reasonable compromise and still saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
