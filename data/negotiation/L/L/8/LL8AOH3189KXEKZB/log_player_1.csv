{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with it.  I'm confident that I can still get a good price from Bob, but I also have the backup option of selling to John for $8,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price by counteroffering. I'll aim for a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still gives you a great value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
