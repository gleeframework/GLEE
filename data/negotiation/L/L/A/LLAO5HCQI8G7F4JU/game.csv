"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your own valuation.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
