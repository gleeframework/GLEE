"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to formulate a counteroffer that is attractive to Alice but still within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your own valuation."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $850,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Better than buying from John:**  This offer is significantly cheaper than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** While you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will continue to push back and you'll end up paying more.

**Next Steps:** You've secured the product at a good price. Now you can focus on the details of the transaction."
