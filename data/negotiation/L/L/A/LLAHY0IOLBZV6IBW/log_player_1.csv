Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that I know you value highly. Given its worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering its value and the fact that I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly leverages John's guaranteed offer, adding weight to the price.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid him rejecting it and going with John's offer."
