"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  I think this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
