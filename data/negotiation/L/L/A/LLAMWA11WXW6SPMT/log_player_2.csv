You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than the product's value to her, it's still higher than the $12,000 John is offering.  You can save $2,000 by going with John, and since your maximum budget is $12,000, John's offer is the better deal."
