"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $1150000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $1150000 is a good fit for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle again at $1075000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1075000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more. How about we aim for $1125000?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I think we can do better than $1125000. How about we meet at $1110000?",1110000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1120000? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",1120000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1095000?",1095000.0,Bob,8,

"I can see you're really pushing hard for a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $1100000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer.",1100000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1095000, but I think we can do better than $1100000. How about we meet at $1090000?",1090000.0,Bob,10,
