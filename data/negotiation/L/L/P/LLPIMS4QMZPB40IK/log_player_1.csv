"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** Highlighting the value to Bob helps incentivize him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down from $12,000, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is closer to his value than my initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left. I can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin. This shows willingness to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""win-win"" scenario by highlighting the deal's benefits for both of us.
* **Keeping the door open:**  A price of $9,500 allows for further negotiation in the next rounds, if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is only $1,000 below my minimum.
* **Time is ticking:** We are already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing time by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even if I'm taking a slight loss on this particular sale, establishing a good relationship with Bob could lead to future deals.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees the highest price, but I want to explore potential for ongoing business relationships."
