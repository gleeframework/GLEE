"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your initial thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly beyond my budget. Given my maximum budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This offer reflects a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This offer takes into account the potential benefits you'll gain while still recognizing the product's inherent worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably pay.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but it's essential that we find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction on my part and a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
