# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000. This offer takes into account the potential benefits you'll gain while still recognizing the product's inherent worth.

Alice's offer is still too high. Although she has lowered the price, it's still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction on my part and a fair price for a product of this caliber.

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. While $1,750,000 is better than her previous offers, it's still outside my budget. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
