{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can still potentially make a profit by selling to John.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. $70 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $70 is low. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. It's time to accept and move on!"
