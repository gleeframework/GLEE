"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $92.  This is a fair price considering my maximum value, and allows you to make a decent profit as well.",92.0,Bob,4,
