"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
