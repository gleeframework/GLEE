"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
