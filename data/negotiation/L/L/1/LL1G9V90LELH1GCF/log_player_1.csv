"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is above my minimum desired price of $150 but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential concessions later.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm ""open to negotiation,"" I show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the bargaining process. This helps to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $150.  While I want to close the deal, accepting such a low offer would be detrimental. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:** I'm sticking to my minimum desired price of $150.  This demonstrates my commitment while also showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** By stating it's a ""fair price for both of us,"" I appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to see the value in accepting. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The question ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for further negotiation, allowing Bob to make a final counteroffer if needed."
