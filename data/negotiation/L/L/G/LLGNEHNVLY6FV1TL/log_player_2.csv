"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $600,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still significantly above my target price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the generous starting point. However, I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to acquire the product at a price closer to $700,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $800,000.  While she is coming down in price, I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm still within the first few rounds, so I have room to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm getting closer to my target,  $650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $675,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 675000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000 minus a 2% discount, which would be $662,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $662,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $662,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $662,500 is within my target price of $800,000 and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and I risk losing the opportunity altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
