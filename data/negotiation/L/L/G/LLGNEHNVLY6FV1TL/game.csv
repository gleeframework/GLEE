"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the generous starting point. However, I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to acquire the product at a price closer to $700,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm getting closer to my target,  $650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $675,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",675000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000 minus a 2% discount, which would be $662,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",662500.0,Alice,5,
