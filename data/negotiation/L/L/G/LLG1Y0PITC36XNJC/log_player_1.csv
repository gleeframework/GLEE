Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but still leaves me with a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or if I should move on to John's guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I'm not comfortable with that low price. I believe the product is worth more and want to see if I can get closer to my initial ask. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $15,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a decent profit while potentially being more appealing to Bob.  If he rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,500 more than what John is offering, and it's close enough to my desired price point.  I'll accept his offer to secure a sale and a decent profit."
