{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and your potential gain. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This allows for some negotiation space while still aiming for a profit.  I'm also highlighting the potential gain for Bob to make him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go as low as $15,000.  Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'd be willing to come down to $16,000. This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $15,000 would be a fair price for both of us. Could you consider coming down to that amount? It would allow me to purchase the product at a reasonable cost while ensuring you receive a fair return for your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to budge from $15,000, and while that's my minimum, I'm not willing to continue negotiating for a lower price.  John is offering me my minimum, so it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
