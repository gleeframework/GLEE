"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I've done some research and this product is truly unique. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
