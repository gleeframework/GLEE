"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
