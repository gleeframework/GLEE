"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  Rejecting allows you to try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm offering you $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can still get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to make this work.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to what we're looking for.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to your target, you can still get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice one more time before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to my budget, but I'm still hoping to finalize this deal. How about $8,250?  This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll accept $8,500 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this.  If you're not comfortable with this offer, I'm really going to have to start thinking about selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you can still buy the product from John for $8,000, you're only saving $500 by doing so.  Alice has come down to $8,500, and it's likely that you won't be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds.  Accepting the offer will save you some time and potential hassle."
