Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below our minimum price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it keeps the door open.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob."
