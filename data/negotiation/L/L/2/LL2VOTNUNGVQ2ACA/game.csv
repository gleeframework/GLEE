"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great value for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
