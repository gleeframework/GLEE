"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is better than Alice's asking price of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are 9 rounds remaining, and Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000 if he can't secure a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great value for you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is closer to his desired price, he's still willing to push for a lower price.  He has 7 rounds remaining, so there's still time to negotiate.  He also has the option of buying from John for $8,000, so he's not under pressure to accept Alice's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 9000}
