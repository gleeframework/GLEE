Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a great price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is slightly above Bob's estimated value. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, but also sets a strong starting point. It's important to remember that you have a backup buyer in John, so you don't need to accept any offer below your minimum value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to accept a sale, it's best to hold out for a better price. You have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no need to settle for less than your minimum. You can counteroffer Bob and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  This gives us both a fair price and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered your minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal considering your backup buyer (John) is also willing to pay $10,000.  There's no reason to continue negotiating further and risk losing the deal."
