"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a great price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $11,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  This gives us both a fair price and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
