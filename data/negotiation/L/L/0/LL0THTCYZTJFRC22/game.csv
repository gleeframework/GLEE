"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good price for you, and I'm able to make a profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, as you'd get a good deal on a valuable product, and I'd still be able to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10900.0,Bob,6,
