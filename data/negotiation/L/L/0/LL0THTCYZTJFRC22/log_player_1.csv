{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good price for you, and I'm able to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than Bob's value:** $11,500 is higher than Bob's $10,000 value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Lower than my minimum:** It's lower than my $12,000 minimum, making it attractive to Bob but still allowing me profit.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. It's worth one more counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to my desired amount. I'm confident that I can push for a slightly higher price before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $11,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, as you'd get a good deal on a valuable product, and I'd still be able to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum. While I'd prefer to make a profit closer to my initial goal, selling to John at $12,000 ensures I don't lose out and secures a solid deal."
