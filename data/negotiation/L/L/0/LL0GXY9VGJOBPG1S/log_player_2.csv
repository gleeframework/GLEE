Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still above your budget and your maximum value for the product. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can reach a more agreeable price.  You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're getting close, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value I bring to the table. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This price reflects a compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, $1,050,000 is still higher than your budget and slightly higher than your maximum value for the product.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price.  You can make a counteroffer closer to your budget and see if she's willing to meet you there."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has finally dropped her price to $990,000, which is within your budget and slightly above your maximum value for the product. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go lower. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $800,000, but this deal with Alice is only $10,000 more.  Accepting her offer is the most logical choice, as it's still a good deal for you and you've reached a compromise."
