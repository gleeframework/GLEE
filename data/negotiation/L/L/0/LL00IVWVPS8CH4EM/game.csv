"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it has immense potential value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still significantly below what you're willing to pay, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,000,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you.  Let's settle on $950,000. This allows us both to make a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
