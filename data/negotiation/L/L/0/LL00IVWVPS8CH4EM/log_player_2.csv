Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still significantly below what you're willing to pay, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.
