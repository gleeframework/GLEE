"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to my target price. I can try to counteroffer with a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me and the potential for a mutually beneficial relationship.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's latest offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation, as there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  I'm better off buying from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
