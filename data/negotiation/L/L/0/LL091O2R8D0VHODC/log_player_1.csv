Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly,"" Alice subtly implies there might be other interested buyers, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Alice starts at $15,000, the phrasing ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement somewhere above Alice's minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob tends to be very price-sensitive, she might lower the initial offer slightly to avoid scaring him away.
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are readily available at lower prices, Alice might need to be more aggressive in her pricing."
