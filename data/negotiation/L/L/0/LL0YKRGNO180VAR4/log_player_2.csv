"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  There's a chance she's willing to sell for less, and rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to explore that possibility. Buying from John offers no advantage, as Alice is already offering the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a substantial drop from $1,500,000, but it still leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This shows she's willing to negotiate. It's still worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you have multiple rounds left. Buying from John at this point would be a loss compared to Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a significant increase from my last offer, but still lower than Alice's latest proposal. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $1,150,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,100,000. Accepting this offer saves me $350,000 compared to buying from John. It's also possible that if I reject this offer, Alice might not come down further, or she might become less motivated to negotiate. It's a good deal, and with limited rounds left, it's wise to close the deal."
