"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know would be incredibly valuable for your needs. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, but it's still a significant markup from Alice's perceived value of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob signals that he's looking for a better deal.  This might prompt Alice to make a counter-offer closer to Bob's acceptable range."
