"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise, and still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product at a good rate and me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",1250000.0,Alice,5,
