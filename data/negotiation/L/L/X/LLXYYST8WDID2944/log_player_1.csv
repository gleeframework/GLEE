I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $750,000 is a decent sum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially considering the product's value to me."

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired value than what John is offering. It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk losing out on a good price."
