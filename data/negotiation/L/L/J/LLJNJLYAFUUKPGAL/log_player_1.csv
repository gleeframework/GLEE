This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while keeping the possibility of selling to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm going to counter with a lower price to see if we can find a middle ground.  If that fails, I'll still have the option of selling to John."
