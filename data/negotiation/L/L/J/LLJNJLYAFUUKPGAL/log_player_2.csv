"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a better price from John, so there's no reason to accept anything above his maximum price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This would allow us both to make a good deal. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than the price John is offering.  Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or simply buy from John at his target price."

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's slightly higher than his target price of $1,200,000, it's still a better deal than buying from John. This is especially true given that Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of losing the deal entirely."
