{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to incentivize him.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible.  Since Bob values the product at $80, there's a potential for a win-win situation where we both get something we want.  I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I'm willing to take a bit less than my ideal price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85.
* **Better Outcome Possible:**  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my original offer, aiming to find a middle ground.  I will also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to offer unreasonable prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is a bit lower than I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my original offer and his offer.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that allows me to make a profit while also making a deal with Bob. $95 is a price that is closer to my ideal price, and I believe there's a good chance that Bob will accept it. I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to offer unreasonable prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  It's a fair price and I'm happy to buy it at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for $100, which is a less favorable outcome.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate takes time, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, $90 is a reasonable compromise and a good outcome for me."
