"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm confident you'll find it quite compelling, but I'm also realistic about the potential price range.  I'm starting with a price of $1800000.  What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $1400000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1600000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
