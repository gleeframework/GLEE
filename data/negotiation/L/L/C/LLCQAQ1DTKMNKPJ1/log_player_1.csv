Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently incrementing his offers in smaller amounts. This suggests he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond the $960,000.  Accepting his offer represents a $240,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
