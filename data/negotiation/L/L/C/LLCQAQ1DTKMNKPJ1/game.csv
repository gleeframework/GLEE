"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd like to offer you $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept $980,000 â€“ but that's my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $980,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go to $960,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",960000.0,Bob,6,
