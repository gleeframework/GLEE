"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product to you and my goal to maximize the earnings. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $5 more from John, but it's still within your budget and saves you $5 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
