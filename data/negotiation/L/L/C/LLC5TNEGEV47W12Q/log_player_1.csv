Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting fairness:** Emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to both of us helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) as possible.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob as long as he makes counteroffers that are within my acceptable range. However, I'll also be mindful of the time spent negotiating and will be ready to accept John's offer of $1,200,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also far below my initial offer of $1,000,000, which indicates he might be trying to take advantage of the situation. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price and try to work out a deal that is fair to both of us. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to switch if the negotiations with Bob drag on or become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Consider the value of the product and the fact that I could easily sell it to another buyer for a much higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** I'm firmly rejecting Bob's low offer, emphasizing that it's below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting my options:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options (selling to John) and that he's not in a position to dictate the price.
* **Offering a compromise:** I'm suggesting a price ($800,000) that is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our initial offers.  
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I'm framing the price as a ""win-win"" for both of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  By offering a compromise and emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal, I hope to convince Bob to accept a price closer to my desired price. I'll continue to monitor the negotiations and be prepared to switch to John's offer if necessary."
