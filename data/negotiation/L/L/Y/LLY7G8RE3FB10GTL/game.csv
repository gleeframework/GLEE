,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm motivated to sell.  Would you be willing to do $12,000? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about $10,500?  That's a firm offer from my side.",10500.0,Bob,6,
