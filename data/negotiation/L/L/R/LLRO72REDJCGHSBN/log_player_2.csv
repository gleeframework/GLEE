Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to pressure me, but I'm not budging. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're serious about getting this deal done, I expect you to meet me at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.

Alice is clearly holding firm and is unlikely to go much lower. While it's not the $800,000 you initially aimed for, $915,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away entirely."
