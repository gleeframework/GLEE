"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
