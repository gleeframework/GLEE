"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as 115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for 125. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product!",125.0,Alice,5,
