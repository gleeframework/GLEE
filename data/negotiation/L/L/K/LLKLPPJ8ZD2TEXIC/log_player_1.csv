Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This gives me a bit of wiggle room for negotiation while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $115 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $115 and my previous offer of $130. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $118 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough. I'm satisfied with the offer from John, which guarantees me my minimum desired price of $120."
