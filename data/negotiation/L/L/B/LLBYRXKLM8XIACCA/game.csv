,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet in the middle.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $85 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $75? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
