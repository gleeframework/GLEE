"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, potentially worth far more than $1000000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I believe it could be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1500000.  This is a price that reflects both the product's inherent worth and a desire for a mutually beneficial partnership. Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested party who is willing to pay $1000000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
