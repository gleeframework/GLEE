{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting close to the $1 million mark. Accepting $980,000 provides a significant profit over my minimum ($800,000) and John's offer. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
