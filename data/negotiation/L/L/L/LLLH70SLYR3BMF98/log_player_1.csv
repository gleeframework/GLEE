Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted price from his perceived value might incentivize him to close the deal quickly, providing Alice with a certain and immediate profit."
