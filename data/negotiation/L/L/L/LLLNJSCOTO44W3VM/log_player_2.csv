Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I have to be honest, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the value I placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if this works for you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Given my initial offer of $850,000 and your valuation, I believe a price of $900,000 would be fair and allow us to close the deal. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and meet you at $925,000.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'm determined to get the price down further.  We've reached a point where I think it's worth making one more counteroffer to see if we can strike a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly above my budget.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to my minimum price.
