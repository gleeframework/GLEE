I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's fair for both of us."

$1,000,000 is too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to what I know the product is worth.  I think this is a fair offer, and hopefully, Bob will agree."
