"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it holds significant value for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to you is substantial.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $1,175,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like. I can continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price. I'm still comfortable with the possibility of buying from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept this offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,112,500?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my limit. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions, but it's also a risk that she might decide to walk away and I'd have to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a price that's still within my budget and saves me the hassle and risk of further negotiations."
