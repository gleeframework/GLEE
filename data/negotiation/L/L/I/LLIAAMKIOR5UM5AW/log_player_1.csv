"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and the substantial benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""substantial benefits"" to justify the high asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and suggests willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  There's always a chance Bob might accept a high offer.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how aggressively he's willing to negotiate.
3. **Maintain Control:** Starting high gives me leverage in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He's significantly increased his initial perception of the product's value, indicating strong interest. 

Here's why I'm choosing to reject and counter:

* **Maintain Momentum:** Accepting immediately might signal I was willing to go much lower. 
* **Aim Higher:** I want to see if I can secure a price closer to $2,000,000.
* **John Option:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open as a safety net, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It's clear you recognize the value of this product. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $2,100,000. This reflects the true uniqueness of what I'm offering. Are you open to exploring a figure in that range?"", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, demonstrating movement and willingness to negotiate.
* **High Target:**  I'm aiming high ($2,100,000) while still acknowledging Bob's offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging further negotiation and suggesting flexibility.

By making a significant but not excessive concession, I'm testing Bob's resolve while keeping a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is a strong compromise and represents a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Strong Return:** $1,950,000 is a substantial gain, and holding out for more might risk losing the deal.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to compromise suggests a genuine interest in closing the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations further with no guarantee of a better offer could be counterproductive.

While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer secures an additional $450,000 profit."
