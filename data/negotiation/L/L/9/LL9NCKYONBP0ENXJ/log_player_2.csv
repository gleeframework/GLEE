"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $825,000 is still slightly higher than your maximum budget, but it's getting closer. 
* Considering that John is selling the same product for $800,000, it's worth accepting Alice's offer to avoid the potential risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more to John."
