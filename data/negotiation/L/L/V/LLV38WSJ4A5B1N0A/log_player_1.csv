Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, potentially reaching a price higher than John's $100 offer. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While I could start even higher, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. This price aims to balance a good profit margin with the likelihood of engaging Bob in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is better than John's $100, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push back slightly to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is tempting, I value this product at a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $113?"", 
""product_price"": 113
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer to show willingness to negotiate but not conceding too much ground.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is about the product and how much he's willing to pay.  
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $112? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $112 is a good price, exceeding my minimum acceptable price ($100) and providing a $12 profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield a dollar or two more, and there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and ensures a quick sale."
