Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While I need to secure a good price, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. $1,200,000 is too low, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,400,000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John at a lower price."
