# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly what Bob is willing to pay, but no lower.  This means there's no benefit to accepting her offer. Bob can get the product for the same price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
