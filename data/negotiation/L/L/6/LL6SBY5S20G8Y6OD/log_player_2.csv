"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Bob ($8,000). 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob can counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** By rejecting the offer, Bob risks losing the product to another buyer. However, the potential savings outweigh this risk."
