Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and how far he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his value range and can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my target value by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum and significantly higher than selling to John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of losing the deal altogether isn't worth it at this point."
