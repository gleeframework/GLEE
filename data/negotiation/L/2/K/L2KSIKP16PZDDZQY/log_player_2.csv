"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal as it's worth significantly more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'll pay $9,500, which is better than your backup option of $10,000 from John.
* **Value:** You value the product at $10,000, so even at $9,500 you're still getting a good deal."
