Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds significant value. I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point considering the product's potential."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 at this time. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement within our budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my floor price, I believe the product is worth more. Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the chance to counter and hopefully secure a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have 9 rounds to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and provides some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1125000. This seems like a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I'd ideally prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
