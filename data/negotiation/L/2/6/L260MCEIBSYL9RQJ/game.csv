"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 at this time. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement within our budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and provides some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1250000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1125000. This seems like a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can strike a deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
