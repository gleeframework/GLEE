{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $155 is closer to my budget than previous offers, it's still too high. I'm not willing to pay that much, especially since I know I can buy the product from John for $120.  I'll continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price or at least get her closer to my desired price point. I've got a few more rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer.  I'm going to offer Alice my maximum price of $120. If she accepts, great! If not, I'll buy the product from John. I've already shown Alice I'm willing to negotiate, and this is my absolute limit.  I'm running out of rounds and need to make a decision."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $152 is still higher than my maximum budget. With only one round left, I don't have time to negotiate further.  It's better to buy the product from John for $120 and save myself the risk of Alice continuing to ask for a higher price."
