Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,900,000.  I'm confident it will more than prove its worth."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer anchors the negotiation in my favor. Even though it's significantly higher than both our valuations, it gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,500,000? I believe this would still allow both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a significant jump down, indicating potential for further negotiation. While $1,500,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still push for a higher price before settling or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,750,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:** 

I've come down from my initial offer but not by too much. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a significantly higher price than Bob's counteroffer. The message also reinforces the value proposition, reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see you're looking to keep the price within your budget, Bob. I understand your constraints. How about we aim for $1,600,000? This still reflects the product's value while staying within your financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a strong price. It represents a significant profit margin above my minimum ($1,000,000) and continuing to negotiate for a potentially smaller gain carries the risk of losing Bob altogether. It's best to secure a good deal now."
