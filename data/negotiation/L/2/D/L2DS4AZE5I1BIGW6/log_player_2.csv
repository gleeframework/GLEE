"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but also wants to stay within a reasonable range.  $1,050,000 is a strong counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also leaves room for Alice to make a counter-counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to profit.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and potentially moving closer to John's price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal for Bob while minimizing risk."
