# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. That's a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
