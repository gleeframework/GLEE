,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $9,750 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a bit higher. Let's try $10,250.  It's closer to my original price and  still represents a good deal for you. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
