Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible while still getting a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum value, but I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial asking price and $5 more than what John would pay.  It's not my ideal price, but it's worth accepting to avoid risking losing the sale altogether."
