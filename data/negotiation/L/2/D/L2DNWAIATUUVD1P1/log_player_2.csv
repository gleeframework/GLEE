Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $920,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $915,000?

Alice is clearly very attached to that $920,000 mark and unlikely to go lower.  $915,000 is a good price, and it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiations falling apart."
