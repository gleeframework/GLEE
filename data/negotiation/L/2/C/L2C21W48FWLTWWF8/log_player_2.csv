"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875

Alice is now offering a price that's within your acceptable range.  Since you're getting a decent deal and have a limited number of rounds left, it's best to accept the offer."
