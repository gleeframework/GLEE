"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll derive from the product, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This offer is a significant step toward finding an agreement.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a $50,000 increase from your last offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your potential return on investment.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your point, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This offer is right in the middle of our last two proposals and I believe it's a good starting point for a fair deal. Let's aim for a quick resolution and finalize the agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. I think this price reflects the product's value and your potential return on investment.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
