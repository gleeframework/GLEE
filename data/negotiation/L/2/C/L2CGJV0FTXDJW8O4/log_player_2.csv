"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product to you. It's a game-changer in its field and I believe it could be incredibly valuable to you, given its worth of $12,000 to you. I understand the importance of value alignment when making such significant purchases, so I would like to offer you the opportunity to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $10,000. This represents an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality asset at a price that is still significantly above market value but below its perceived worth to you. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $12,000 and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's a good deal, even if it's above Alice's valuation.** You're still getting a good price even though Alice values the product at $8,000.  You are willing to pay more because you value it higher."
