"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,750?",9750.0,Alice,3,
