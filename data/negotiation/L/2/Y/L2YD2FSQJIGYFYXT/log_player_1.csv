Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I believe a fair price for me would be $1,500,000. This acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob landing at $1,500,000 puts him exactly on par with John's offer. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiations falling apart."
