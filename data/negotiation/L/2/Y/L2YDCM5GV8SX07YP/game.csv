"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm serious about buying the product.  Let's make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
