Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and moving closer to our desired price point. It's worth another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob seems anchored at $1,200,000. It's time to show him we have other options and are serious about our valuation.  This might push him closer to our $1,375,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I've already received a firm offer for $1,000,000 from another interested buyer.  I'm prioritizing our negotiations, but to be transparent, I need to see a price that reflects the product's true value.  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000 as a final offer. This gives you a significant advantage over the other potential buyer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning John's offer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. Bob may be more likely to budge knowing he's not the only option. 
* **Finality:** By framing it as a ""final offer"" we're signaling this is our bottom line.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down to $1,300,000 shows flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still the one with the cash in hand. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product. I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** We've pushed Bob close to his limit. It's unlikely he'll move significantly beyond $1,200,000.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging out negotiations further has a cost. Accepting now gives us the sure thing. 
* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is still a $200,000 profit over our guaranteed offer from John. 

While we could try to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing Bob and settling for $1,000,000 is likely not worth it at this point."
