"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob needs to make a significant counteroffer to get the price closer to his ideal range. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This initial counteroffer is a relatively aggressive move, but it's designed to establish a lower starting point for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** The offer still acknowledges the value of the product to Alice, while also pushing for a price that aligns with Bob's budget.
* **Next Steps:** Bob will need to be prepared to counter-counteroffer if Alice doesn't accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still above Bob's target of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob wants to continue negotiating to see if he can get Alice to come down further.
* **Next Steps:**  Bob will counteroffer again, trying to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $10,750?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Bob is moving incrementally closer to Alice's offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. 
* **Midpoint Compromise:**  $10,750 is closer to the middle ground between the two offers. This approach shows flexibility and can encourage Alice to meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a desire to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice towards acceptance."
