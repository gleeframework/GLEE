This offer gives me a significant profit, while still leaving room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on this product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $1 million, accepting his offer is still a significant profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
