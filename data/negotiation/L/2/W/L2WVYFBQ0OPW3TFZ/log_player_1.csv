Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to him than to you, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While I would prefer to sell for $115,  Bob's offer of $110 is still a good deal for me, exceeding my minimum of $100. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
