"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $8,000? I think that's a fair offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I'm getting closer to your price range, but $8,000 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I could meet you at $9,500. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
