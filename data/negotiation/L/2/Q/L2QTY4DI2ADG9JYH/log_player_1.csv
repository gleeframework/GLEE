"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe it's a bit high, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially from John if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $7,500 is simply too low. It's not even close to my minimum price.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value you've stated.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,500 and $8,500. How about we try $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I believe I can negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob has already indicated that he's willing to go above his initial offer. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $7,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  Let's try $8,250. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to meet us halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
