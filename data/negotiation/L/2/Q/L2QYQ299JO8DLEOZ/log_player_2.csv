"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This strategy employs a few tactics:

* **Polite and Appreciative:**  Acknowledging Alice's offer maintains a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a low offer ($6,000) sets a lower anchor point in Alice's mind. Even if she doesn't agree to this price, it can influence her subsequent counteroffers. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The large gap between the initial offer and counteroffer signals that you're willing to negotiate, but only if the price comes down significantly.

It's important to note that this is just one approach. You might have a different strategy based on your risk tolerance and how much you value time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still more expensive than John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my current budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this purchase if we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

Here's the breakdown of this counteroffer:

* **Positive Reinforcement:** We acknowledge Alice's movement and continue to express a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Incremental Increase:** We raise our offer to $7,000, showing willingness to compromise, but not overly large jumps.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning eagerness to purchase can sometimes encourage a quicker agreement.

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price.  $8,000 is my bottom line.  If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met your maximum price.  There's no point in trying to negotiate further or going with John, as they both offer the same price."
