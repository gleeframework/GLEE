"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but not too far off.  This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping a positive and friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the product's value can make Bob more likely to see the price as reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but my budget is limited. Could you consider lowering the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have 10 rounds, and Bob has already shown interest. There's a good chance I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John if I need to walk away. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and increases the likelihood of an agreement.
* **Focus on value for Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing his potential benefit. 
* **Maintain my minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it's a significant concession to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Keep the door open to John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a better solution. Would you consider selling the product for $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $8,200 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:** Bob is coming closer to my desired price.  There's still potential to get a better deal.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John if I need to walk away. This gives me the leverage to continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you to find a solution.  Let's try $8,300. It's a small step up from your offer, and it keeps us moving towards an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  I'm making a small increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my minimum.
* **Focus on Progress:** I emphasize the movement towards an agreement, making Bob feel like we're getting closer.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  $8,300 is still above my minimum, so I retain the option to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. How about we aim for $8,100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even though it's a small increase, $8,100 remains below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We've reached Round 6 out of 10, so we need to be strategic about the remaining time. 
* **John's offer is a safe haven:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob has been increasing his offers, suggesting there's still room for a higher counteroffer from him.
* **My counteroffer will be close to John's price:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer close to John's price ($10,000) to push Bob to make a final decision. If he doesn't, I can sell to John and still achieve my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm getting close to my deadline. To make this work, I'm going to need to come up to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure and Finality:** I'm emphasizing the time constraint and presenting this as my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Significant Counter-Offer:** By increasing the offer significantly, I'm putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying the price increase.
* **Close to John's Offer:**  $9,500 is closer to John's offer of $10,000, leaving less room for Bob to counter. This makes selling to John a more viable option if Bob rejects my offer."
