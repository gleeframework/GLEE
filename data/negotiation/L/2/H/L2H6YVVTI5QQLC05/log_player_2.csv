"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000). There is ample room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget for this product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only offer $5,000 at this time."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a low offer ($5,000), we establish a strong negotiating position. Even if Alice rejects this outright, it gives us more room to counteroffer upwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer acknowledges Alice's desire to sell while clearly signaling that her initial price is unacceptable.  There's a significant gap between our offer and her asking price, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup, so we are not pressured to accept a deal outside our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $5,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $12,000 is still above both our target price and John's offer.  We should continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $8,000?  That would be a price I'd be very comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** We are moving closer to a potential agreement. By countering with $8,000, we are signaling that we are willing to meet Alice close to our maximum price. 
* **Direct and Clear:** This offer is straightforward. We are clearly stating our preferred price and implying that we might not be willing to budge much beyond this point.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  By holding firm at $8,000, we subtly put the pressure on Alice. She now needs to decide if she is willing to accept a lower price or risk losing the sale entirely (since we have John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has made it clear that $10,000 is her absolute lowest price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **John's Offer is Better:** We have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000. Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying by $2,000.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not be worth the potential savings. Accepting John's offer gives us a sure thing and allows us to move forward."
