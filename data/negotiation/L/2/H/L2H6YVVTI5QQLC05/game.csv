"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget for this product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only offer $5,000 at this time.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $5,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $8,000?  That would be a price I'd be very comfortable with.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
