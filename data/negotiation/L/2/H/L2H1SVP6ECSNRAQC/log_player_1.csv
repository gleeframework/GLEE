"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm setting the price high enough that Bob is likely to counteroffer, allowing for a back and forth negotiation.
* **Being friendly and open:** I'm using friendly language to establish a positive tone and encourage a good negotiation experience."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity to improve:** I still have 9 rounds left to negotiate, and there's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps me in control and allows me to counteroffer, potentially driving the price up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Given the product's unique value, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price is fair and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's offer but below my minimum:**  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the product's value:**  Reminding Bob of the value of the product strengthens my position.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and open tone is crucial to keep the negotiation constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and am willing to increase my proposal to $1,550,000. This is my final offer within my budget constraints. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:** $1,550,000 meets my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited time and risk:**  While I could potentially negotiate higher, there's a risk that further rounds could result in a lower offer or even a complete breakdown of the negotiations. 
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a satisfactory price. 

Selling to John would result in a higher price, but I'm taking into account the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and the potential for a longer negotiation process."
