Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.  How about a price of $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $1,250,000 is a significant profit margin for me (over the $1,000,000 value it holds for Bob) while still being potentially attractive to him. It leaves room for negotiation if he counters. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and expresses confidence in reaching a deal, which can be persuasive."
