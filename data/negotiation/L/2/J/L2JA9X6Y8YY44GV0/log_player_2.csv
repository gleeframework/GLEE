"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer right away. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price, so it's better to try and negotiate.  Buying from John right now also provides no benefit as Alice's offer is the same."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price, but not the full asking price. This initial counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal. Since there are still rounds left, Bob can try to push for a lower price.  Buying from John right now would be a waste since Alice is offering a lower price, even though it's not the ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer while still staying within his budget.  The offer of $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but still wants a fair price. This counteroffer should further encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price again, and it's now within a reasonable range for Bob. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate.  While there are still rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will offer a price lower than $13,000. Buying from John would be more expensive and unnecessary."
