"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm very interested in the product, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $820,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",820000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $820,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm happy to offer you $780,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I can do $810,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",810000.0,Alice,5,,
