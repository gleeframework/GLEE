"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $820,000. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $820,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm happy to offer you $780,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the purchase. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 780000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I can do $810,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $810,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. It's more advantageous to buy from John at $800,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
