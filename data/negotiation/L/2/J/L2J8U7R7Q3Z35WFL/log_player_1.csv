"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $120 is a good starting point. It's significantly above my minimum value of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive to Bob:** Offering a price close to Bob's perceived value makes the deal seem attractive and increases the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  It allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects the offer, giving me 9 more rounds to potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer closer to my desired price and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value of this product for you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  My counteroffer of $100 moves closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum price.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to make my price seem fair.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, ensuring I have more flexibility in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $95 is very close to my minimum desired price of $80. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and prevents potential losses if I keep negotiating and end up selling to John. 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $100, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gain in this scenario."
