"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's better than John's price, I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $750,000,  which is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Focus:**  Highlighting the value for both of us emphasizes that this is a fair deal for both parties.
* **Clear Next Steps:**  The message invites Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $850,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident I can negotiate further and secure a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still above my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing Towards Agreement:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Emphasizing ""mutually beneficial"" further reinforces the idea of a fair deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly suggests that we are getting closer to a decision, potentially prompting Alice to consider accepting the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm not sure I can go any lower than this, so I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000. This is only $25,000 more than my last offer, and I'm getting closer to my target price of $800,000.  There's a chance I could negotiate further, but with only 5 rounds remaining, it's a risk to keep pushing.  Accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice, as it secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice ending negotiations."
