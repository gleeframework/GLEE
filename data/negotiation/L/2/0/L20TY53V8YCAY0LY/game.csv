"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? I'm willing to make a fair offer, and I think this is a good compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
