"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from what you're asking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
