"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for something worth much more. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $100 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $98. Can we do that?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $98 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  Let's compromise at $99.  It's just one dollar more, but it makes a big difference for me.",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $99. I'm willing to meet you at $96. Can we do that?,96.0,Bob,8,
