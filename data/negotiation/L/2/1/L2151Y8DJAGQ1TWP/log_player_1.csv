"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for something worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still below my minimum but higher than Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and try to push for a higher price. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm determined to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm trying to be flexible and find a solution that works for both of us. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm also showing willingness to compromise to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $100 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $98. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $98 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I have a few more rounds left, so I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $98 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  Let's compromise at $99.  It's just one dollar more, but it makes a big difference for me."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

I'm trying to get closer to my minimum price while still being reasonable. I'm hoping that the small increase will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $99. I'm willing to meet you at $96. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8, and Bob's offer of $96 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've only got two rounds left, and I'm not confident that I can get Bob to accept a higher price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum price."
