While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal of $200, I've reached a point where the potential of further negotiation is diminishing. Bob's offer of $160 is still more than what I'd get from John, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting his offer seems like the best option to secure a sale at a decent price."
