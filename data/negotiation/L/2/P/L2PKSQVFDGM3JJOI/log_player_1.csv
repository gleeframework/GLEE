{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($15,000), but I'm also aware that Bob's valuation is lower.  Offering $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while also demonstrating my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value and barely covers a fraction of what I need to get.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find some middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is unfortunately far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $5,000 is a big difference, Alice.  Let's try to make this work - would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll counter-offer again, trying to push for a price closer to $9,000. I want to make sure I get a good deal without jeopardizing the sale completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's compromise at $8,500. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
