,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still below what I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $105? It's a fair price that respects both our needs.",105.0,Alice,5,
