"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can come up with a fairer price. How about we aim for $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $15,000 to me, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. It's worth exploring further negotiation before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the worth of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can reach an agreement closer to my previous proposal. How about $10200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for a more favorable deal. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,200 is still a bit below what I consider fair.  Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,700. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10700}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10500. This is a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $10,600? It's a fair price that shows we're both willing to compromise, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10600}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $10450 for the product. This price respects the value of your product while also staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,450 is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a higher price.  It's more prudent to sell the product to John for $15,000 and secure a much better return."
