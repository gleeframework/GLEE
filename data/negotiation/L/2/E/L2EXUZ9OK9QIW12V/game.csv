"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can come up with a fairer price. How about we aim for $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9500 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price that reflects the worth of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can reach an agreement closer to my previous proposal. How about $10200 for the product?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10200 is still a bit below what I consider fair.  Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10700. This price acknowledges the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.",10700.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $10500 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $10600? It's a fair price that shows we're both willing to compromise, and it gets us closer to a final agreement. What do you say?",10600.0,Alice,7,
