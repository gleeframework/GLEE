"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can get it for $8,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the market value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget. He can get the product from John for a lower price. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Even though Alice has lowered her price to $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for a price that fits his budget."
