"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product looks great, $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle on $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $6,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $7,250. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,6,
