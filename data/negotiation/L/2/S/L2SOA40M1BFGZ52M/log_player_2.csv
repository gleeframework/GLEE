"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget:**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,000.
* **You have room to negotiate:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.
* **John is a fallback option:** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can always buy from John. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, you can try to get Alice to lower her price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  You're aiming for a price that's closer to your ideal maximum of $15,000.
* **Testing the waters:** By offering $13,000, you're gauging Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Negotiation strategy:** This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Next steps:** Based on Alice's response, you'll adjust your strategy accordingly. If she rejects your counteroffer, you'll need to consider whether to offer a higher price, or if you're getting closer to your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging much:** While she lowered her price, it's still above your ideal.
* **You have room to negotiate:** You've only had 3 rounds, and you still have 7 rounds left.
* **John is your safety net:** You can still buy from John if you can't get a better deal.

**Strategy:** Continue to counteroffer and try to push Alice towards a price closer to $13,000. You're still in a good position to negotiate, but you need to be assertive in getting the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer is halfway between your previous counteroffer ($13,000) and Alice's latest offer ($14,500).
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but still want a fair price.
* **Strategic positioning:** This offer gives Alice a chance to accept without losing too much, while also giving you a chance to get a better deal than her previous offer.

**Next steps:** Based on Alice's response, you can decide whether to make a higher counteroffer if she rejects it, or consider buying from John if you think you're getting close to your limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at your limit:**  Her offer is your absolute maximum, and further negotiation likely won't yield a better price.
* **John offers the same price:** You're not losing anything by going with John, and you're avoiding further negotiation rounds.
* **Time pressure:** You've already had 5 rounds, and you don't want to waste more time if you can get the product at the same price from John.

**Strategy:**  It's not always about getting the absolute best price. Sometimes, it's about making a decision that's efficient and avoids unnecessary risk. In this case, John offers a secure option, and there's no reason to gamble on further negotiation."
