"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $800000 or more. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
