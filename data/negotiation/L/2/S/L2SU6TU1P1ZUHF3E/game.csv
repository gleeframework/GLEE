"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $700,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $600,000?  That's a significant price, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  However, I'm sticking to my budget. I'm willing to pay $625,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to accept $625,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the product's true value to me. I'll sell the product to you for $675,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",675000.0,Alice,7,
