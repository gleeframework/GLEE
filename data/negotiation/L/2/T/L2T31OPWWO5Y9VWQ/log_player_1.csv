"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a good starting point considering my minimum acceptable price is $150. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable offer. I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob but I'm also keeping John's $150 offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm rejecting his offer and will attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with $175.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 and represents a compromise from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and may be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have liked to get more, accepting his offer is the best option at this point. It avoids further negotiation and ensures I get at least my desired price. Selling to John would get me the same amount, but accepting Bob's offer means I get to keep the negotiations open with him for potential future deals."
