{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

While $90 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I am too.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $92.50 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really close to your price, but I'm still a little hesitant at $92.50.  How about we settle on $91?  It's a fair compromise for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $92.50, $91 is a good price and  a fair compromise.  We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less."
