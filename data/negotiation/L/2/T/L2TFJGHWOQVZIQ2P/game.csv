,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  I'm confident you'll still get a good deal at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,750 isn't quite enough for me. Let's try $11,000 again. It's closer to your offer and still a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but no higher. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,800.  Let's meet at $11,000 one last time. It's a fair price for a high-quality product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to budge on the price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll offer $10,600, but that's my final offer.",10600.0,Bob,8,
