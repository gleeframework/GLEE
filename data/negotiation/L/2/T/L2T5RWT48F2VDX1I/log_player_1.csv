{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think it's a great value considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's some wiggle room for you to increase the price if he counters.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price slightly below what you know Bob is willing to pay, you show that you are open to discussion and a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $13,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your ideal price. You have some leverage here.  Rejecting his offer gives you the chance to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $13,500, and I'm definitely open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $14,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,750?  It's a fair middle ground, and it would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,750 is a good compromise. It's still a profit for you and a good deal for Bob. It's time to finalize the deal and avoid risking a further counteroffer that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
