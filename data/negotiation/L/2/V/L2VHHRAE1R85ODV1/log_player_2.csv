"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer leaves room for negotiation. While $11,000 isn't a terrible price, it's worth seeing if you can get it closer to Alice's valuation of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming low:** Starting with a low offer of $10,000 (Alice's valuation) gives you the most room to negotiate upwards while still staying under your $12,000 limit. 
* **Polite and direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time and clearly states your desired price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for further discussion and counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $10,800 is closer to her valuation than yours. However, there's still room to haggle. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to $10,000 without being unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle on $10,400? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10400
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice in the middle between her last offer ($10,800) and your previous offer ($10,000).  
* **Maintaining politeness:** The tone remains respectful and collaborative, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic positioning:** You're still well below your $12,000 maximum and have left yourself room to negotiate slightly higher if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $10,600. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has, once again, met you in the middle. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. This offer gets you the product for $1,400 less than John's price and $600 less than her initial offer.  It's a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
