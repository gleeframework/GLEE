"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us â€“ you get a valuable product for a price that's well within your budget, and I get a fair price for something I've invested a lot in. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have the option to buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer to my asking price, it's still not enough for me to be comfortable letting go of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it for $925,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $800,000. You have a better alternative in John, who is willing to sell for your maximum price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, hoping she might come down further, but if she doesn't, you can always go with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in her price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John, who is willing to sell for your target price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as you might end up paying more than you're comfortable with.  It's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
