""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $1,700,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you consider $1,600,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It provides a significant profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
