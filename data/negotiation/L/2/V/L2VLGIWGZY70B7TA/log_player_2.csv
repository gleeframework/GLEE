"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $11,500. This is slightly below the market rate but still offers a great deal considering the benefits it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the market rate, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are more rounds, and Bob can counteroffer, potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the lower price, but I'm still looking to save a little more. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a competitive offer. Considering your budget, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still higher than his target of $10,500. Bob should continue to negotiate. There are still several rounds left, and he could potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to pay $10,750 for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial price. My counteroffer for the product is $10,900. I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $400 above Bob's counteroffer of $10,500.  Considering there are only 5 rounds remaining, it's likely that further negotiation will only yield minor savings. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price close to his target and avoids potentially getting stuck with John's higher price."
