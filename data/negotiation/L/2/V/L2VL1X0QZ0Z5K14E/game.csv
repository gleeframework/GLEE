"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to sell for. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $92 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know what you think.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $92, which would be $91. Can you consider that?",91.0,Bob,6,
