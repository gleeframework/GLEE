"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door to counteroffers, but still emphasizes my desired price. 

This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while keeping the option to sell to John if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is willing to go up, $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I haven't exhausted my rounds yet.
* **Staying firm:** By rejecting the offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 

This approach gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially bringing the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to sell for. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm using this round to make a counteroffer, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation but still upholding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $95 is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive framing:** The message is still positive, highlighting my desire to make the deal work.

This strategy continues to build upon my earlier approach, pushing for a price that is closer to my target while keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's still a gap, and I haven't exhausted my rounds yet.
* **Staying firm:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

This strategy continues to prioritize getting closer to my desired price point, while keeping the option of selling to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $92 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the gap:**  I'm coming down a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Setting a firm bottom line:**  $92 is my absolute lowest price, communicating that I'm serious about this offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message stays positive and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us.

This strategy continues to build on my previous approach, pushing for a more favorable price while leaving room for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $92, which would be $91. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the rounds, and we're only $1 away from Bob's final offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $91 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. The risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price outweighs the potential reward. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is significantly better than what I can realistically expect from Bob at this point.

This decision prioritizes a guaranteed profit over the risk of further negotiation with Bob, especially given the limited number of rounds remaining."
