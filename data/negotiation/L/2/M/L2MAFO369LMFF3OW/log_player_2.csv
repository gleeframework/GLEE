"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800000 to you. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. While $700,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to secure a better deal. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident the product's value is worth more than $650000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to pay even less, accepting her offer at $675,000 is a good deal for me. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it avoids further negotiation rounds that could potentially lead to a higher price."
