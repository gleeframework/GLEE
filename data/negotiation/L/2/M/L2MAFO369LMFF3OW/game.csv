"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. While $700000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to secure a better deal. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident the product's value is worth more than $650000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
