"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I want to find a price we both feel good about, I can't go as low as $9,800.  Would you consider $10,200? It's a small adjustment but shows I'm serious about closing this deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $9,900? It's a small adjustment from my previous offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground.",9900.0,Bob,6,
