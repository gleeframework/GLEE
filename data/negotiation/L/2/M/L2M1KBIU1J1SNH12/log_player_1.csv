Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it provides significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):**  While $119 is a strong offer, there might be a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering it at $120 or more risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. By pricing it slightly below his perceived value, I increase the chances of a successful sale and avoid having to sell it to John for $100."
