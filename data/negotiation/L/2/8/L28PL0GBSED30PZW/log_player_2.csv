"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item holds immense value for us, but we believe it would be an incredible addition to your collection or business. We are offering this remarkable product to you at a special price of $2000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far above his budget and he can get the product for less from John.  The next step is to counteroffer Alice and see if he can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We appreciate your offer, and while we understand your current budget constraints, we would like to present you with a more flexible option. We are willing to consider a price of $1600000 for the product. We believe this offers a balance between our valuation and your financial considerations.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his maximum budget.  He should counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. We're glad to hear that you're still considering our product. We've carefully reviewed your offer and are willing to negotiate further. We propose a price of $1550000 for the product. We hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still above his target price and while he could counteroffer again, there's no guarantee that she'll accept.  John is offering the product for the same price as Bob's maximum budget, so it's the safest and most efficient option to avoid further negotiation."
