Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still over his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate further with Alice, or consider buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my last offer.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still over Bob's budget, and further negotiation is unlikely to get her down to a price he's comfortable with. John is offering the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best option available to him."
