"I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is the highest I can go at this point. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my final offer in this range.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,000. This is my last offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
