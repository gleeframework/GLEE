"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $12,000. This is my maximum price, and I'm confident it's still a good value for you considering your own valuation. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're hoping to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and within my budget. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think $14,500 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14500.0,Alice,5,
