"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm firm on $11,250.  It's a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product valuable.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,
