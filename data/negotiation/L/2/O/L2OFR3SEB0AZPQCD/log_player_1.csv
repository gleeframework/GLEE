Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but not excessively so allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  The $11,500 offer surpasses your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) by a significant margin, ensuring a profitable outcome even if Bob negotiates down slightly."
