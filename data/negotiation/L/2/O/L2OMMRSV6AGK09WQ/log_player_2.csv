Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $850000? This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's closer to the value I need. Let's find a middle ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $800000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.
