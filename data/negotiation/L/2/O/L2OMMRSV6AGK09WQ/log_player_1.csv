"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price, and a solid value for you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum value, but I believe there's potential to get more from Bob with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $850,000? This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's closer to the value I need. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $750000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to a deal, $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I need to keep negotiating to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point.  There are still rounds remaining, and I believe there's more room for negotiation. Selling to John would guarantee my minimum value, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $800,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it will be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $800000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I can only go up to $780000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $780,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe there's potential to get a slightly higher price from Bob. We're only a few rounds away from selling to John, and I want to make sure I'm not leaving any money on the table.  I'm confident that with one more counteroffer, I can get Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $790,000 as a final concession. This is a great price for both of us, and it's the best offer I can make. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 790000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $790000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I can only go up to $780000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's counteroffer is still significantly below my minimum value.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close a deal with Bob, I need to ensure I secure a price that meets my financial needs.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum value of $1,200,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  It's time to move on and secure the best possible deal."
