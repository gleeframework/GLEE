"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us,  $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique benefits, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects the value you'll gain from the product. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting closer to being comfortable with the price, but I'd like to get even closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,275,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
