Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to you, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives us a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Setting a High Anchor:** Offering a price of $925,000 sets a high anchor. While it's ambitious, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still securing a great deal for Alice. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly justifies the high price by mentioning the ""potential value"" to Bob, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice still has the safety net of selling to John for $800,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit by appealing to Bob's perceived value while having a backup plan."
