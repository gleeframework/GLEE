Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it provides.

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need, and I want to try to get closer to my target.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is simply too low for this product.  It's worth a lot more than that, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to show my commitment to a deal.  This price is still very fair, considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price, but $950,000 is still too far off from where we need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

I'm still determined to get as close to my minimum price as possible. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I want to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence.  To be honest, $975,000 is still below my target. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer, but not quite to my minimum price.  I've tried to be flexible, but it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement.  To avoid risking getting less than my minimum, I'll go with the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
