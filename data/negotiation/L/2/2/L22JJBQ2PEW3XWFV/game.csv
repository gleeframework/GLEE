"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is tempting, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your perspective.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the slight reduction, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,025,000? This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
