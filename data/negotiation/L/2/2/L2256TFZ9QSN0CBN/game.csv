"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to keep my expenses within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work for both of us.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to cover my costs.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly settle on $8,500? This would allow me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still well below my initial offer. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $8,750. This is my best offer given my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your efforts to compromise. However,  $8,750 is still a bit too far from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $9,000. This is a significant price reduction from my previous offer, and it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for everyone. We're so close!",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to offer $8,875 for the product. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with my budget while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair compromise that meets both our needs.",8875.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product and the progress we've made, I'm willing to offer one final compromise.  $9,125. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on! If you don't accept, I will have to consider other offers, and we may miss this opportunity.",9125.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to accept $9,125. My last offer is $8,875. This is my final offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to you. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while keeping it within my financial limits.",8875.0,Bob,10,
