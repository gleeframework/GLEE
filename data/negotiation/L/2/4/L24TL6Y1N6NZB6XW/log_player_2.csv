"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, higher than John's offer. You can save $200,000 by going with John."
