"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is tempting, I'm not able to let it go for that price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to exceed $8,000 for the product. Could we perhaps find a common ground at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find that sweet spot! I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? It's a small step up from your last offer, and I think it would make both of us happy.",8750.0,Alice,5,
