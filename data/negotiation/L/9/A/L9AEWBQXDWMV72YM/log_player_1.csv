{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point.  It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers. If he rejects, I can adjust the price down slightly while still earning more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your effort. However, I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is tempting, I'm not able to let it go for that price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to exceed $8,000 for the product. Could we perhaps find a common ground at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for below $9,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find that sweet spot! I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? It's a small step up from your last offer, and I think it would make both of us happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
