**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a lower price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still not satisfied. I can try to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1,050,000, but I need you to meet me at $1,050,000, not just get close to it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,050,000. While I'd prefer a lower price, it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice backing out entirely. It's better to secure the product at this price."
