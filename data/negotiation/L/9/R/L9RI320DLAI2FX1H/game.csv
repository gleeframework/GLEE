"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $8,250. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",8250.0,Alice,5,
