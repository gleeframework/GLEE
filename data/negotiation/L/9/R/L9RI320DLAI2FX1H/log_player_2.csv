Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $8,100. It's the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $8,100 secures a good deal for you while avoiding the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
