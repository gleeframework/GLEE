Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer allows you to benefit from it at a price below your perceived worth."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the slightly lower price than $120 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Securing a Deal:** We don't want to price it too high and risk Bob rejecting the offer. This price point makes it very appealing to him while still netting you a significant profit."
