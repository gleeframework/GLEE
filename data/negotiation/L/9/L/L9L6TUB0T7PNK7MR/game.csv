"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $18,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Let's try $17,000.  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",17000.0,Bob,4,
