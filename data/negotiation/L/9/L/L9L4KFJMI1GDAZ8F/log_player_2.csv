Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for this round. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me closer to the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell for $1,000,000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. What do you think?

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $1,025,000.  At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is the safer option now."
