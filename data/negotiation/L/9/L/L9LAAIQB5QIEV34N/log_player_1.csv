Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000, as I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,750. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not ready to accept his offer.  I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.  I'm also not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise. This way, we can both get a good deal.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. I'll offer $10,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. There's only a $400 difference between his offer and what I'm willing to accept. I want to see if we can bridge the gap further, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $10,000. There are still 4 rounds left, and I believe I can get a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,600 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,700. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10700}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. I'll offer $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price. It's only $200 higher than John's offer, and there's a significant chance Bob will continue to counteroffer at lower prices. With only two rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a lower price, especially since I can get a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
