,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,750. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,750 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise. This way, we can both get a good deal.  Let's close this deal!",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,600 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,700. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",10700.0,Alice,7,
