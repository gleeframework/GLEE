"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high that it seems unreasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I can still make a profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to reach a price that's more favorable for me.
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation and can potentially extract a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This product is really high quality, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintaining control:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's high quality to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a great product Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below the $12,000 I could get from John.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I have the option of selling to John, so I don't need to settle for a price that's below my minimum.
* **Possibility of a better offer:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. He has shown a willingness to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $10,250? This would give you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it would be a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By offering to split the difference, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Appealing to logic:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing the value Bob would receive.
* **Finality:**  I'm not mentioning a ""final offer"" yet, but the wording subtly suggests that this might be my last concession."
