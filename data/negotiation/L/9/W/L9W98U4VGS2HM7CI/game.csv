"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today.",85.0,Bob,4,
