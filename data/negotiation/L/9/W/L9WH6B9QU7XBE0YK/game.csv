,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $18000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $10000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but $10000 is not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $18000, which would be $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12000, which is a good compromise and allows for some profit on your end. Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $12000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $18000 again, which would be $15000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
