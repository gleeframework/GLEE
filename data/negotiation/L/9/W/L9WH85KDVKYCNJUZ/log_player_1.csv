Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal on a product you'll love, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $115 is a good price, and I'm confident I can make a profit. It's better to close the deal now than risk going through more rounds and possibly having to sell to John for less."
