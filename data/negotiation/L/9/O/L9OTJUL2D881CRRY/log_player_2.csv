"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You get the product for $9,000, which is within your budget and saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John:** This costs you $12,000, which is your maximum budget but doesn't offer any savings. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to achieve your goal of buying the product while saving money."
