"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still lower than its value to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing message:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a good deal. 
* **First Round:**  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much room I have to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,300,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. It's also closer to the product's value to Bob, which means he has more leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I have 8 rounds left and  I have a strong fallback position with John.
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and I am willing to walk away if necessary. This will likely encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:** I'm showing willingness to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much.  $1,600,000 is still above the product's value to Bob but closer to his offer. 
* **Emphasize value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob that this price still represents a significant value to him, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about $1420000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,420,000 is still well below the product's value to me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 
* **Negotiation is progressing:** While Bob's offer has improved, there's still room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I can still sell the product to John for $1,500,000, giving me a solid fallback option. 
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer again demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a good price and not simply settling for the first acceptable offer. 

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,550,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my last offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,420,000). This shows a willingness to compromise further.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair to both parties.
* **Maintain confidence:** I'm expressing confidence that we can reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating. 

This round is about finding a price where both Bob and I feel like we are getting a good deal. By meeting him halfway, I hope to get closer to closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, $1,400,000 is still significantly below the product's value to me. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We've made progress, and I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **John is a strong fallback:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer again shows my commitment to getting a fair price. This could encourage Bob to increase his offer even more. 

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1,475,000.  This would be a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  I believe we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1475000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and maintain value:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my last offer ($1,550,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,400,000).  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm emphasizing the need for both of us to compromise in order to reach an agreement.
* **Time is running out:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a move that could close the deal.
* **John is a strong option:**  I'm still confident I can sell to John for $1,500,000 if necessary. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's, I hope to encourage him to accept and avoid losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1475000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1475000, which would be $1437500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,437,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,437,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to the final two rounds of negotiation. 
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,437,500 is still significantly below the product's value to me. 
* **John is a safe and profitable option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a sure thing and will guarantee a higher profit than accepting Bob's final offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There is no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.

Given the limited time and the certainty of a better deal with John, it's strategically wiser to sell to John and secure the profit."
