"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $1300000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1600000?  This price still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I get a fair price. Let's try to find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current offer. How about $1420000?",1420000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $1550000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, $1400000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be. Let's split the difference one more time. I'm willing to come down to $1475000.  This would be a great deal for you and a fair price for me.  I believe we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to compromise.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1475000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1475000, which would be $1437500. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1437500.0,Bob,8,
