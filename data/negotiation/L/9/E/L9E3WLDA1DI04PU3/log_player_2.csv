# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair. How does $1200000 sound? This gives you a substantial savings and allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!
