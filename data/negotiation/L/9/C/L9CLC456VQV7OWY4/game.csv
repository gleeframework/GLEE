"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  While $14,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
