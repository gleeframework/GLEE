"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  While $14,000 represents the value I place on this product, I understand your budget constraints. Could we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for more, accepting $11,250 is a reasonable compromise. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
