"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1150000, which is a $50000 reduction from my initial offer, but still a premium to your initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value the product holds for you, while also being mindful of your budget.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
