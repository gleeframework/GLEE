Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
