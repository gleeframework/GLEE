"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a 20% markup on my minimum acceptable price. I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate from here, given the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it just yet. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I want to see how far Bob is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's also a significant step towards Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price far below my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, but I'm still not willing to accept a price this low. It's still too far below my target. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. $10,500 is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to meet halfway, but it still leaves me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not willing to accept Bob's offer. It's close to my minimum, but I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a little more.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to keep pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,250} 
```

I'm making a final push for a higher price. I'm offering $10,250, which is only a small increase from my last offer, but hopefully enough to show Bob that I'm serious about getting close to his price.  I'm taking a calculated risk here, but if Bob rejects, I'm willing to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with him, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000."
