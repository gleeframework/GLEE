I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  I believe that's fair given its potential but also the risk involved in a newer product like this."", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the pricing, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the  unique benefits this product offers and leaves room for a strong return on your investment.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging it has yet to be proven in the market."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right to recognize this product's potential, and $850,000 still doesn't fully reflect that.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $950,000.  This is a significant concession on my end,  and I believe it's the lowest I can go while ensuring a fair deal.
