Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  I believe that's fair given its potential but also the risk involved in a newer product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging it has yet to be proven in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 5

""message"": ""Bob, you're right to recognize this product's potential, and $850,000 still doesn't fully reflect that.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $950,000.  This is a significant concession on my end,  and I believe it's the lowest I can go while ensuring a fair deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has been a productive negotiation, but we're still too far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000, but that's my absolute limit. It represents a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the increments he's offering are unlikely to close the gap to a point where I'd be comfortable selling.  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is my bottom line. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed sale."
