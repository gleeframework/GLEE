"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",10750.0,Bob,4,
