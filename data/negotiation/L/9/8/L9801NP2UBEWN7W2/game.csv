"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? I hope this proposal will be more acceptable to you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This still leaves a substantial profit for you while giving me a fair price for the product. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I would prefer a lower price, I respect your valuation of the product. Given our current discussion, I propose a price of $825,000. This offers a compromise between our previous offers and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
