"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it can be highly valuable to your business. My initial price is $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value it brings, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to reflect your budget constraints. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice's position and the value she places on the product. However, given my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000, which is closer to her original asking price but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
