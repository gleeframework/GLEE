"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate with Alice. Her initial offer is too high. We have room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

We're starting with a strong counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price and what John is offering. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a deal, but we're sticking firm to our goal of getting a good price. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting closer to the price I had in mind, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

This is a tricky one. Alice is getting close to John's price, and she's implying this might be her best offer.  However, we're still in a good spot to try one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal, but $14,500 is just a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair offer and would let us both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

This is our final push. We're offering a price that's beneficial for us but also reasonable for Alice. If she rejects this, we might have to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $14,250. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and we're now at a point where John's offer of $15,000 is more appealing.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
