"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about $13,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're getting closer to the price I had in mind, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal, but $14,500 is just a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair offer and would let us both walk away happy.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $14,250. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",14250.0,Alice,7,
