"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get a better price while still being within his budget.  The $8,500 offer is a compromise, showing good faith and leaving room for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8750. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** $8,750 is lower than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* **It's a fair compromise:** While Bob wanted $8,500, Alice's offer of $8,750 is a reasonable middle ground. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it also risks reaching a stalemate or Alice walking away entirely.

Since the offer is within Bob's budget and a good compromise, accepting it is the most logical choice to secure the product quickly."
