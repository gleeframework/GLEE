"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $11500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to consider a price of $11250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
