"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $800,000 on this product. I'd be happy to discuss a price closer to that figure.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial offer already reflects a significant discount on the true value of this product. I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider a price of $1,000,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1,000,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet. Would you be willing to consider $850,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in trying to find a price that works for us both. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay above $900,000 for this deal to make sense for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you're still getting a great value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be above $900,000, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $850,000. Let's meet in the middle and try $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
