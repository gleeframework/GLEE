"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming for a price lower than $150. 
* Alice's offer is too high, and you have room to negotiate.
* It's better to try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* This price is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation.
* It's a strong starting point for bargaining and demonstrates my willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.
* While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I'll end up with no deal or having to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price."
