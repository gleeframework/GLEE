# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Round 2

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

* **Keep Pushing:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

You can send a counteroffer closer to your desired $1,000,000 mark, but perhaps a bit higher to show your willingness to compromise."
