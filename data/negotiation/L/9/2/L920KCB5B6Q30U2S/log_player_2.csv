"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent discount, it's still above his budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. He should reject the offer and try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is tempting, Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He's very close to his target price of $8,000 with John.  There are still rounds left, so Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm feeling more comfortable with $9,750.  This is a fair price that is closer to my budget, and I believe it would be a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750}
