Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While we appreciate your budget constraints, we're unable to match the proposed price of $850,000. Our current offer stands at $950,000, which represents a significant profit margin for us. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. However, we're open to discussing further if you could consider increasing your offer slightly.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and our position, we are unable to accept $900,000. However, we are prepared to reconsider our previous offer to $975,000. We believe this price reflects a fair compromise that maintains a good profit margin for us while being competitive for you. We hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob has negotiated down the price to $975,000. This is a good price for him, as he is still saving $225,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could continue to negotiate, the likelihood of getting a better price is low.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point."
