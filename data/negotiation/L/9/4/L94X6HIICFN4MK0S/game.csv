"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $850,000.  This would still represent a significant profit for you while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While we appreciate your budget constraints, we're unable to match the proposed price of $850,000. Our current offer stands at $950,000, which represents a significant profit margin for us. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. However, we're open to discussing further if you could consider increasing your offer slightly.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $900,000? This is a reasonable midpoint between our current offers and would still allow you a strong profit margin. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and our position, we are unable to accept $900,000. However, we are prepared to reconsider our previous offer to $975,000. We believe this price reflects a fair compromise that maintains a good profit margin for us while being competitive for you. We hope this proposal aligns with your expectations.",975000.0,Alice,5,
