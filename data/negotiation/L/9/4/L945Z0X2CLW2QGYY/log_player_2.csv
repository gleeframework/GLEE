# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me.

To make this acquisition possible, I am proposing a price of $1200000 for the product. This amount reflects a fair compromise between the intrinsic value of the product and my desire to ensure a profitable transaction for myself.

Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and aligns with your financial plans. I am open to discussing further details or adjusting the terms if necessary, with the ultimate goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

Looking forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together.
