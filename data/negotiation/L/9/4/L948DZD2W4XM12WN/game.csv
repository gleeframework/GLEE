"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for some wiggle room for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $1,000,000? This is a fair price considering I could buy the same product from John for that amount.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
