"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $110 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105? That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I don't think $105 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
