Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) making it attractive to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, allowing me to potentially secure a price closer to his maximum perceived value."
