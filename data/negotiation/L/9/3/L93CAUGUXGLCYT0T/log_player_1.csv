I'm going to try to get a better price than Bob's initial offer.  I'm willing to go back and forth a few rounds before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to drop my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 more than what I could get from John.  It's not a huge gain, but it's worth it to avoid further negotiation."
