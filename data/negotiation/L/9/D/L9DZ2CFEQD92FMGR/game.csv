"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. Can we discuss further from here?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding middle ground. However, this product holds significant value, and $750,000 undercuts that. How about we settle at $900,000? I believe this reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Can we meet at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
