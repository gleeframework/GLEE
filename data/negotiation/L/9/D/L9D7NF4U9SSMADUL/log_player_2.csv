"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  I believe it holds significant value for you as well.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, meaning you won't save any money by accepting.  Since you can get the product for the same price from John, it's better to reject Alice's offer and keep the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her later."
