{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000) and to Bob ($800,000). This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While I'm starting high, the message doesn't close the door to negotiation, leaving Bob room to counteroffer.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer at the product's worth to me ($800,000). This gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and proceed based on his reaction. 
* **Counteroffers:** If Bob counters, I'll assess his offer and either accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **Ending the Negotiation:** If negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I have the option to stop and sell to John to ensure a guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Protection:** I need to protect the value of the product, which is worth at least $800,000 to me.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer for $800,000 provides me with a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price. 
* **Assess Progress:** I will carefully analyze Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I'll sell to John to secure a guaranteed $800,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $650,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm making a counteroffer closer to Bob's price but still higher than my minimum. The message explains my reasoning and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Finding Common Ground:** The message conveys a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not accepting his initial offer, signaling that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response and proceed based on his reaction. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm prepared to continue negotiating if Bob makes another counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John:** If negotiations stall or become unfavorable, I'll sell to John to secure a guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. Accepting his offer would mean leaving money on the table.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** I'm aiming for a higher profit than what Bob's offer provides. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **John as a Safeguard:** Selling to John guarantees a minimum of $800,000, providing a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $800,000. 
* **Assess Progress:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's willingness to negotiate and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations continue to stall or become unfavorable, I will sell to John to secure a guaranteed $800,000."
