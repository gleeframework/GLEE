"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $140 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $120.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
