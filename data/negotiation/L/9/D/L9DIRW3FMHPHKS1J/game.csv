"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $13,000 is still too low for me. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $12,500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,500 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I really hope we can reach an agreement.  ",13000.0,Alice,5,
