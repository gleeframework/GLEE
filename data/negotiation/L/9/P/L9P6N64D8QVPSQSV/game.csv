"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $125 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go.",130.0,Bob,6,
