"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on a product that's truly worth $1,000,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
