"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to my ideal price. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,750? It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to compromise to get the product",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this.",10900.0,Alice,5,
