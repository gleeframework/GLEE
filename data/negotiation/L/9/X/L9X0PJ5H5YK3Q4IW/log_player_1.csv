Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $120 represents a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($80) but is still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  Even if he negotiates down slightly, I'm still likely to get a better price than selling to John."
