"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $130?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet at $145? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",145.0,Alice,5,
