# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is only worth $80 to Bob. Alice is asking for $90.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $82 is closer to Bob's value, it's still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $75.  How about $78?  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm now offering the product to you for $83. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice is still offering a price higher than his value. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, as that's the lowest price he can get."
