"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the condition of the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250?  This would still be a great price for you considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids me having to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
