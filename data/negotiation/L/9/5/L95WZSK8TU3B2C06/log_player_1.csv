"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I'm sure will be a great addition to your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I receive a profit significantly above my minimum.  It also establishes a friendly tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $820,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $820,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $820,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000 to make this deal work. This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
