,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you and within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115, which would be $122.50. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",122.5,Alice,5,
