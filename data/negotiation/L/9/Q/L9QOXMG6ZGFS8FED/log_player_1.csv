Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* I'm hoping to get the most I can from Bob, but I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price. 

**This strategy is based on the following:**

* **Uncertainty:** I don't know Bob's valuation of the product. This makes a high initial offer a risky move.
* **Backup Buyer:** Having John as a backup provides me with a safety net, allowing me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  If Bob values the product more than $15,000, I stand to gain more than I would by simply selling it to John."
