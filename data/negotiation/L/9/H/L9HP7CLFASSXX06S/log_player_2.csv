"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,001. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist this offer.

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming for a price that fits perfectly within my budget.  I'm ready to offer $1,150,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,150,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $1,150,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,275,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is coming down in price, her offer of $1,275,000 is still higher than what you're comfortable paying.

Buying from John guarantees you get the product within your budget."
