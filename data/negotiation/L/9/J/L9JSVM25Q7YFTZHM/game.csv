"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is fantastic, that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
