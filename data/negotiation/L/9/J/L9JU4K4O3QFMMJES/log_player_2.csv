Alice's offer is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $92.5 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I've been negotiating with Alice for a while now, and it seems like we're stuck.  John's offer is a much better deal for me, so I'm going to go ahead and buy from him."
