"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's initial offer is quite high considering her own valuation of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a reasonable markup from her $80 valuation.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer allows room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it. We can gradually increase our offer if needed.
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a great price for both of us, considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved a bit on her price, which is a good sign. However, we still have room to negotiate before hitting our $120 maximum. Let's see if we can get her closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We are moving closer to the middle ground between our previous offer ($90) and Alice's counteroffer ($100). 
* **Signaling Willingness to Compromise:** By increasing our offer, we demonstrate to Alice that we are serious about buying and willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We continue to keep the communication open and encouraging for further negotiation."
