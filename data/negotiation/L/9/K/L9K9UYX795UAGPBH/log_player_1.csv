Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a keen interest from another buyer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""limited-time offer"" and mention of another buyer creates urgency and potential for a higher perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final sale price above your guaranteed $1,000,000."
