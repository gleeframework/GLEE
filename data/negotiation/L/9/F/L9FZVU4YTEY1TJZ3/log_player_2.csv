"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John and save $100,000."
