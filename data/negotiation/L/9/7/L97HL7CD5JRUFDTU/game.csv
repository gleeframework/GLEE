"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I can offer you a compromise at $12,200. This is my bottom line, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
