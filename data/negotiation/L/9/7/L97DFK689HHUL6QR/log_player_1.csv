Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his eagerness to purchase and how much he might be willing to pay.  
* **Fallback Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 provides a safety net. You can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial ask to Bob."
