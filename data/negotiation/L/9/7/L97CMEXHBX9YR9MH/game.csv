"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we settle on $14,250?
