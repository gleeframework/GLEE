"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product! It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm confident it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob,  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $111. It's a fair compromise, and we can both move on from here.",111.0,Alice,5,
