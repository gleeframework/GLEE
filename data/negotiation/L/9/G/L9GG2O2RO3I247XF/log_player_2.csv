"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product! It's worth at least $120 to me, and I'm confident it's worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is higher than our budget and what John offers. We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $135 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob,  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $111. It's a fair compromise, and we can both move on from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $111 is a reasonable price, especially compared to John's offer of $120. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
