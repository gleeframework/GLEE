"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can do $8,400, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it hard to find a better price elsewhere. What do you think?",8400.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,700?",7700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not comfortable with $7,700. I can do $8,200, which is still a good discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
