Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be immensely valuable to your operations, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your $1,200,000 value as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below that would be leaving money on the table. 
* **John as Backup:** The safety net of John's offer allows for a strong negotiating position.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and prevent him from counter-offering.

By offering the product at $1,199,999, we aim to capture the maximum possible profit while still giving Bob a (small) incentive to buy immediately rather than risk losing the opportunity."
