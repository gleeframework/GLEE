Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I've started with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves me with a profit. 
* **Message:** I've included a friendly and professional message to Bob, highlighting the value of the product to him and inviting a response.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm aiming to:

* **Entice Bob:**  The lower price makes the offer more attractive to Bob. 
* **Start Negotiations:** It gives us a starting point for negotiations and encourages Bob to counter-offer.

If Bob rejects the offer, I will consider his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price. If he doesn't meet my minimum, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far below my acceptable range. 

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation, where I will send him a counteroffer. I need to find a price that is acceptable to me while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counter-offering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, but I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him. I'm proposing a middle ground to keep the negotiation moving.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still holding firm to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, it's very close.  Considering the potential for further negotiation and the risk of Bob walking away completely, I'm willing to accept this offer.  It's a good compromise and allows me to make a reasonable profit."
