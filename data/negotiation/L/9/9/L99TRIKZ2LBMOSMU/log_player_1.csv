"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $18,000.  Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's room for negotiation.  This initial offer establishes a high starting point and gives me room to come down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $16,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $18,000.  It's early in the negotiation, and I want to see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his $16,000 offer.  It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Given that we're already in round 4, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoid potentially losing the sale altogether."
