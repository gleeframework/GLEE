"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?
