Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $95 is still too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me counter with $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $100 is a decent price and it's better than selling to John for $120.  I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on the sale."
