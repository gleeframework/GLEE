"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be worth every penny for you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Considering the product's value to you,  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it reflects the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to be sure that's the absolute lowest you can go. Can you consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
