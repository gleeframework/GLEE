Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to be sure that's the absolute lowest you can go. Can you consider that price?

```

We've reached the end of the negotiation. Bob's final offer is $1,200,000. It's still a good price, and considering the possibility of John buying the product for $1,000,000, it's the best offer available at this point. I'll accept Bob's offer."
