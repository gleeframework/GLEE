"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay up to $1000000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm ready to finalize the purchase at $1000000. It's my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
