"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $5,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. We have 10 rounds and can always buy from John if the deal falls through.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows us to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price.  This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, while still leaving room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on her response in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I want to try and get the price even lower.  Rejecting her offer gives me the opportunity to counter-offer again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $4,200. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Alice's last offer.  It's a small increment, demonstrating that I'm serious about a deal but not willing to overpay.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $4,400, which is only $200 higher than my last counteroffer.  Given that I have 5 rounds remaining and the potential to buy from John for $10,000, accepting this offer seems like the best option.  It secures the product at a significantly lower price than John's offer and allows me to potentially save more time and effort."
