"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I propose a price of $120 for it. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's above your maximum budget of $80. You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $95 for the product. This is a fair compromise based on both the value I place on it and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's closer to your target, it's worth trying to negotiate further. You can try to meet in the middle or counter with a slightly higher offer than $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85. This is a fair compromise that respects your needs and my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to negotiate further. I would like to suggest a price of $90 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $90 is getting closer to your target, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have only a few rounds left. You might be able to secure a price closer to your target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  While $90 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $87. This is a final offer from my end, as I'm not comfortable going any higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to agree on a price of $88 for the product. This is my final offer, as it balances my expectations with your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $88 is very close to your budget and a good deal, it's still above your maximum price.  You only have a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  It's better to be safe and buy from John for $80."
