{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's budget and only $800 less than her initial offer.

There's only one round left, and Bob is confident he can secure the product from John for a much lower price, saving him $5,800.  Therefore, it's the best decision for Bob to buy the product from John."
