"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $115. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $115. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can we meet at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit above $105, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $115 earlier. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $110. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price!",110.0,Alice,5,
