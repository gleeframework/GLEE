"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $9,500 is a price Bob might consider, but it's not so high that it immediately shuts down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  Accepting this would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  While Bob is pushing for a lower price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee me $10,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is lower than I can accept right now, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is fair. 
* **Keep the Negotiation Going:**  $9,000 is still a good price for me, and it keeps the conversation open for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would lead to a loss for me.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** We're getting closer to a potential deal, but there's still a $1,250 gap between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and keep the negotiation going.  There's still a chance I can get a higher price in the next round.
* **Not Yet Desperate:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not desperate yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit lower than I can accept. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to proceed with the sale.  Let me know what you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm compromising again, but I'm still holding firm to my value. By offering $9,250, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while staying closer to my desired price.
* **Reiterate Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $9,250 is a fair price for both of us. This helps frame the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Increased Pressure:** By consistently countering Bob's offers, I'm putting some pressure on him to reach a deal. This increases the likelihood of him accepting a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Still Better Than John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,250, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 was a bit too low, so I'll meet you at $9,000. This is the highest I can go. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $9,000 is only $1,000 below my desired price of $10,000. It's a significant improvement over Bob's previous offers.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Bob has stated that $9,000 is his highest offer.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round could risk losing the deal entirely, especially since there are only a few rounds left.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  While John's offer of $10,000 is appealing, I can still make a good profit by accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Time Factor:**  With only a few rounds left, it's more prudent to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal rather than risk going through multiple more rounds of negotiation."
