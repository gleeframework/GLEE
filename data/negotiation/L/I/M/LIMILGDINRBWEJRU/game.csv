"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8,500 is lower than I can accept right now, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
