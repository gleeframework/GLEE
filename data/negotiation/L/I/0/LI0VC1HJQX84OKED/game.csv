"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This revised offer reflects the value I bring to the table, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but that's still quite a ways away from what I'm willing to pay. This product has value, but not at that price point for me. To be frank, I'm only willing to go up to $900,000. If that doesn't work for you, I might need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm confident that the value this product brings to your specific needs goes far beyond your current offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,900,000.  This offer represents a significant investment from my side, reflecting my desire to see you benefit from this product.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's absolutely my limit. I understand this is below your initial asking price, but I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I've been flexible throughout this process because I believe in the value this product holds for you. However, I need to be realistic as well. To make this worthwhile for both of us, I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is my final offer. It reflects a significant compromise on my end while still ensuring a fair deal. Please consider it carefully.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
