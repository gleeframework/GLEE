"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $13,000, Alice.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow me to get a good deal on a product I need.",12000.0,Bob,4,
