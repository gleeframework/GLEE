""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Backup Option:**  We have John as a reliable backup buyer, ensuring we won't have to go below $1,000,000. 

**By setting the initial price at $1,300,000, we create a win-win scenario where we stand to gain a substantial profit and Bob gets the product at a price lower than its worth to him.**"
