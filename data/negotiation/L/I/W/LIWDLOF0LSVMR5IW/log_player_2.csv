"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $20000. It's a great deal for something worth at least $15000 to me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move towards Alice's price but still remains within Bob's budget.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $17000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $18500?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone.  There's room to negotiate further.  Bob can try to lower the price again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $18,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.  This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's previous offer, suggesting a willingness to close the deal but also demonstrating that Bob is still looking for a better price."
