"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price closer to its true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the potential benefits you'll realize from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
