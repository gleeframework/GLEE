"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product's unique aspects command a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This reflects my best effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, however, the $950,000 offer is  below what I can accept. To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point.  Therefore, I'm firm on $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
