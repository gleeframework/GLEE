Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price point that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 minimum.  You've also used the tactic of mentioning another buyer to create urgency.  

At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob carries more risk than potential reward. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your desired price. It's time to secure your profit and move forward."
