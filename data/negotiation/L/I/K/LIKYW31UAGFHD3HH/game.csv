"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,200,000, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer for now.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
