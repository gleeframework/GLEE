Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will give you valuable information for your next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000) if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob countered at $1,200,000, which is significantly lower than your initial ask, but we need to determine if he's willing to go higher. By rejecting and countering, we can try to push the price closer to a point where we might get more from Bob than John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product is worth significantly more than that. Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach aims to find a compromise while still staying significantly above your guaranteed offer from John. 
* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to negotiate upwards from his initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By countering aggressively, you signal that you believe in the product's value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now higher than John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could continue negotiating, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll secure a significantly better deal from him.
* **Securing the Sale:**  Accepting now guarantees a profit above our alternative and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
