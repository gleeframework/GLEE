Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've been looking for. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $100. 
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay more, giving him room to potentially negotiate.
* **It's not too aggressive:** You're not starting at a ridiculously high price that might immediately alienate Bob.

By starting with a reasonable offer, you open the door for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer and above your minimum, you can likely get more. Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and his interest in the product. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Show your commitment to your price point:**  It shows Bob you're not desperate to sell at his initial price.
* **Open the door for further negotiation:** You can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $130. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  You're not settling for the first acceptable offer. 

By rejecting the offer, you're not closing the deal, but setting the stage for more profitable negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Be a reasonable compromise:**  It's halfway between your initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintain your negotiating position:** It's not a huge concession, but it shows you're willing to work with Bob.
* **Leave room for a final agreement:** If Bob accepts, you'll be closer to your goal of $130. If he rejects, you can re-evaluate your options.

By meeting halfway, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $122.50? That's as low as I'm comfortable going, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $122.50 is still below your initial target of $130, it's only $2.50 less. Here's why accepting is a good strategy:

* **Close to your desired price:** You're very close to your goal, and it's unlikely you'll get much more from Bob.
* **Demonstrate flexibility:** Accepting shows Bob you're serious about selling and willing to compromise.
* **Avoid further negotiation:** It saves time and energy, preventing potentially lower counteroffers in the future.
* **Higher than John's offer:** You're earning significantly more than the guaranteed $100 from John.

While you could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal altogether and settling for John's offer outweighs the potential reward. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes further negotiation."
