"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already dropped the price by $3,000 from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
