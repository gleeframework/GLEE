"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price below its worth to you, and I'll get a fair price for something valuable to me.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,
