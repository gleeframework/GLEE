"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000.  This is a significant overprice. I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it reflects the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. While John is a safe option, I'm still hoping to secure a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'll increase my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintains a significant discount from Alice's last offer. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Alice, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
