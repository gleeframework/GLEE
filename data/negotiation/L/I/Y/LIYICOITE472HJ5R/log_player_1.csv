Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin. I'm confident the product's value to Bob justifies a price above my minimum.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's a starting point. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still maintaining a comfortable profit margin.  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still showing that I'm not desperate to sell. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high, and I don't want to miss out on a good deal.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a decent profit."
