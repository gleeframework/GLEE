Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your operations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
We're still significantly above John's offer, so we have room to negotiate. Let's counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the $1,000,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's potential for your business.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,175,000? This price reflects a more realistic valuation while still offering you a substantial return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential deal, but we're still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting close, but we can push a little further. $100,000 is a significant difference, and we still have negotiating room before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to the mark.  To avoid dragging this out further, let's make this our final negotiation. How about we settle on $1,140,000? This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a satisfactory deal."",
""product_price"": 1140000
}
```

We're presenting this as our final negotiation to encourage Bob to accept.  This price still provides us a significant profit over John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. Considering the value I seek for my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to push for a bit more, accepting this offer makes the most sense at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,125,000 is a substantial profit margin, significantly exceeding John's offer.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of losing Bob. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Potential Deadlock:** Further counteroffers might lead to a stalemate if neither party is willing to budge."
