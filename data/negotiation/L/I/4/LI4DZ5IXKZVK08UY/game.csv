"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable to you.  To start, I'm willing to sell it for $1200000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low for me. It's important to remember the value this product holds for both of us. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1050000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $950000 still doesn't work for me. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair for both of us. Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is my final offer. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
