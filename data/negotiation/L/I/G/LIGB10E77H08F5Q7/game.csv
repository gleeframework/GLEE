"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $775,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $740,000? ",740000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $760,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",760000.0,Alice,5,
