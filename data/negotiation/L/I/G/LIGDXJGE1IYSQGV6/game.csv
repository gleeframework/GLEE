,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,750 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. If you're open to that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
