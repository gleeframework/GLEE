"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a different valuation, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a significant step towards your price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $950,000 remains too low for me. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
