Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a different valuation, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a significant step towards your price, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $950,000 remains too low for me. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.
