Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Since John is willing to pay this much, there's no incentive for me to lower the price. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's not worth it to sell to him at such a loss, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise, considering his initial offer of $80, and still slightly above the $100 value he places on the product.  This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since John is willing to buy the product for $120, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob. I will sell the product to John."
