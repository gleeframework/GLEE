"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer for the product is $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I can only go as low as $11,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident that you'll find it reasonable.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to a number you're comfortable with, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,250, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $11,125? This demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase.",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the purchase. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a comprehensive warranty and dedicated support. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for you.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added incentives, but I'm still focused on the base price of the product. To be frank, my absolute limit is $11,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on the price, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I've already gone as low as I can without losing money on the sale. I'm willing to make one final compromise: I'll throw in the comprehensive warranty and dedicated support I mentioned earlier, but I need to get at least $11,250 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,9,
