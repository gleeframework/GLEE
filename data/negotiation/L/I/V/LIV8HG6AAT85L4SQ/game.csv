"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment.",15000.0,Alice,3,
