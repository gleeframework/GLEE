Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?,110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? I think it's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $100. Let's see if we can make this happen.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession. How about $102? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $101.  What do you think?",101.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $103? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",103.0,Alice,7,
