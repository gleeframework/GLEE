I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product's worth more. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's more than what John is offering, and we're already at round 4. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
