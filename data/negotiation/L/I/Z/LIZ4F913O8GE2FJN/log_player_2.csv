# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make it yours for $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob should try to negotiate further and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is my minimum price. Would you be willing to pay that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is now at Bob's maximum budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product and doesn't risk losing it to someone else."
