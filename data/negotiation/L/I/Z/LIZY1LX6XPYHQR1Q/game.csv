"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,250,000 is my starting point, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe this product offers significant value, and this price reflects that while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This would allow you to make a good profit and would be a good deal for me. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
