"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations.  While that number is lower than I'd like, I want to see if we can find a solution. How about we meet at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find a solution here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is getting close, but I need to be closer to $1,650,000 to make this work on my end.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
