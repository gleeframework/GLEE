"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
