Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit but doesn't guarantee Bob will accept. There's always a chance he'll reject the offer, and you'll sell to John at $10,000."
