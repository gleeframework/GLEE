,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're trying to find a middle ground. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm offering $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $925,000.  It's a fair price that we can both agree on. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm offering $910,000.  This is a reasonable price considering your previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",910000.0,Bob,6,
