"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price before selling to John.  $850,000 is too low.  I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're trying to find a middle ground. However, $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm offering $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price before selling to John.  $900,000 is getting close, but I'll see if I can get Bob to go a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $925,000.  It's a fair price that we can both agree on. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm offering $910,000.  This is a reasonable price considering your previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum, and I'm concerned that if I reject him, he may not come back with a higher offer, and I could end up selling to John for less than I hoped."
