Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** At $1,200,000, Bob still gets a good deal, potentially motivating him to accept.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By starting with an offer and sending a message, you demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can either counteroffer or move on to John to secure your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far too low, at $900,000.  While I want to sell the product, I cannot compromise my minimum value of $1,500,000. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can present a new price that's more in line with my minimum, hopefully reaching a compromise.
* **Maintain my leverage:** Showing I'm not desperate for a sale makes Bob more likely to negotiate seriously.

Selling to John immediately would secure my minimum, but I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still give you a significant discount and ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above Bob's offer and below my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that this price still gives Bob a discount, which might incentivize him to accept.
* **Continuing the dialogue:** The message fosters a sense of collaboration and encourages further discussion. 

By maintaining a firm stance while remaining open to negotiation, I aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your original offer. How about we try $1,075,000? This would be a great compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is very close to my desired price. 

While I'm still not at my ideal price of $1,500,000, accepting his offer has these advantages:

* **Securing a good deal:**  $1,075,000 is well above my minimum and represents a profitable sale.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing his offer entirely.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving time and effort. 

Considering the potential risks of rejecting and the relatively good price offered, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most logical choice at this stage."
