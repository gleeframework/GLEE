"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within my budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80). I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll start by rejecting the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to her. This allows for room for negotiation while demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit to $105. I believe this product will be very beneficial for you and $105 is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my target, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80). I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can push the price down further.  I still have 7 rounds left and can always buy from John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $105 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be valuable to me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push the price down, but I'm staying within a reasonable range.  At this point, I'm only $20 away from my goal, and I think Alice might be willing to accept this offer. If she doesn't, I can still fall back on John if needed."
