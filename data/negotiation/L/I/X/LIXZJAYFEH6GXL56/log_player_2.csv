"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my target price of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant discount and reflects my serious interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in acquiring the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both parties. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still above my target price. I'm going to try to push for a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer. There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. I truly believe this product has the potential to benefit my business significantly, and I'm eager to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to get it even lower, I'm  concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice deciding to sell to John.  With five rounds left, it's a calculated risk, and I'm willing to take it."
