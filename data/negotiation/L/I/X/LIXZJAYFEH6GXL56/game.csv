"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a significant discount and reflects my serious interest in acquiring it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in acquiring the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both parties. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. I truly believe this product has the potential to benefit my business significantly, and I'm eager to make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
