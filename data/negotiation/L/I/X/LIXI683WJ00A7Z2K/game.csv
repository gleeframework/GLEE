,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This is a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $107.50 is closer, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about we settle on $109?  This is a small compromise, and I'm sure we can both agree on it.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $108. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",108.0,Bob,6,
