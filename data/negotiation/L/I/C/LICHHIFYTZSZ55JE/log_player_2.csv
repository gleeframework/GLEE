"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's worthwhile to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's worth rejecting and sending another counteroffer to see if he can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that $12,000 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal for $12500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  While there's a chance Bob might be able to negotiate her down further, it's getting late in the negotiation.  The risk of not reaching a deal and losing the product to someone else is increasing.

Since John is selling the product for Bob's maximum price, it's the safest option. Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product for the price he's comfortable with and avoids any further risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer."
