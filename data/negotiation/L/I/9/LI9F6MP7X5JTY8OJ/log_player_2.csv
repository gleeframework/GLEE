Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $900000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your budget.  You can likely get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique nature and the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. Considering the value I've already compromised on, I'll make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product for $1025000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's unique nature and value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your budget, and although you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that she won't budge further.  It's more efficient and less risky to buy from John at this point, as you know his price is within your budget."
