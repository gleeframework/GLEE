"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential return on investment it offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
