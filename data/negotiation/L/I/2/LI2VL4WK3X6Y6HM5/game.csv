"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to hear you're enthusiastic about it. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $950000 is getting closer, but not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Alice,5,
