"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.
