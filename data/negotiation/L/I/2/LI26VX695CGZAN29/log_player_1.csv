Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $7,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $8,000. That's my absolute maximum, but it would allow us both to make a deal.
