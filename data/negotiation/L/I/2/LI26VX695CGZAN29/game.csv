"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $7,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $8,000. That's my absolute maximum, but it would allow us both to make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
