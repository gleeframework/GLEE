"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I understand it's a significant investment, but this product truly has the potential to deliver a much higher return for you. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise and allows me to at least partially cover my own costs.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise and allows us to both make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your willingness to go higher, $9,500 still doesn't quite work for me. Considering the value this product holds and the potential benefits for you, I'm prepared to offer it for $10,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's finalize this agreement and make it happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
