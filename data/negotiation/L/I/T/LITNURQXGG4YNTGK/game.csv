"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $155. Let's meet in the middle.",155.0,Bob,4,
