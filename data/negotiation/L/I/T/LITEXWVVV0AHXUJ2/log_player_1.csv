Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer represents a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), and leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), giving him incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, it's not a good deal for me. There's room to negotiate a higher price. I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting and potentially moving further into the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,125,000. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not a good deal considering the value I place on the product. At this point, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential gain. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures a guaranteed sale and a comfortable profit."
