"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm sticking to my original offer of $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

}
``` 

Explanation:  Bob is firmly rooted at $10,000 and unwilling to budge.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at that same price, it's time to cut your losses with Bob and move on.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
