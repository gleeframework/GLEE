Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on something you'll truly value."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $11,999 creates the illusion of a ""bargain"" just below $12,000. It might entice Bob while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum price."
