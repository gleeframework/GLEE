Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000 is a good starting point.** It's high enough to give you some negotiating room, but not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.
* **The message emphasizes value and exclusivity.** This subtly suggests the product is worth more than $15,000, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **The ""significant discount"" is a strategic move.** It makes the price seem more attractive and creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 

**Remember:**  This is just an initial offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your understanding of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $15000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see it at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it,  reflecting my current budget.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is your minimum, Bob's offer doesn't leave you any room for negotiation. It's crucial to try and get a better price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **You know the product is worth more than $10,000 to you.** You have a clear minimum, but there's potential to earn more.
* **Bob's offer is a test.** He's likely trying to see if he can get the product for the lowest possible price.
* **By rejecting, you gain leverage.** You can now counteroffer and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is certainly a fair offer,  I'm looking for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's unique value and potential. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $12,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  You're acknowledging Bob's offer and showing flexibility by offering a price lower than your initial offer.
* **Highlight the product's value:** You're not just dropping the price; you're justifying the counteroffer based on the product's special qualities.
* **Use language that emphasizes a fair deal:** Phrases like ""significant reduction"" and ""fair compromise""  make the counteroffer sound more appealing and create a sense of urgency for Bob. 

**This counteroffer:**

* **Balances your desire for a higher price with the need to stay competitive.**
* **Keeps the negotiation moving.**  You're showing Bob that you're willing to work with him.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiations.** You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
