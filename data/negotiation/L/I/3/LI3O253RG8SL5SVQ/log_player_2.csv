"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount considering its true value, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no information about the product's actual value. Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate:** Her response to your counteroffer will reveal if she's genuinely interested in selling at a lower price. 
* **Potentially get a better deal:** You might be able to secure a lower price by negotiating.

Since you have a backup option with John, there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $15,000 is at the upper end of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see it at a lower price point. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it,  reflecting my current budget.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is certainly a fair offer,  I'm looking for a slightly higher price to reflect the product's unique value and potential. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $12500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price of $15,000 to $12,500. This is a good deal for you considering you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and it's a saving of $2,500.  While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll end up having to buy from John at the higher price. Accepting her offer is a reasonable compromise and gets you the product for a price you're comfortable with."
