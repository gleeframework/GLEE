Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's significantly lower than your minimum, leaving you space to make concessions during the negotiation process.
* **It shows confidence:** A firm offer demonstrates you're serious about selling and have a clear expectation of the product's worth. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. You also have the option to sell to John at any point for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I'm close to the original price, but I'm trying to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower. You have a strong backup option with John, who is willing to pay your minimum. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can attempt to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand you're trying to save, $900,000 is still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to save a significant amount compared to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Move closer to Bob's offer:** By lowering your price to $950,000, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Still above your minimum:** $950,000 is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, allowing for potential further negotiation if necessary.
* **Highlight the value:**  Emphasize the value of the product to justify the price.  Reminding Bob of the potential savings compared to your original offer can also be persuasive.

This counteroffer creates a more balanced negotiation while keeping your best interest in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the original price and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum of $1,200,000. Although it's closer to your desired price, it's not enough to justify selling the product at a significant loss.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay your minimum price. It's better to risk one more round of negotiation with Bob and potentially get a higher offer, rather than accepting a price that's much lower than your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I understand your desire to save, $920,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $935,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're able to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** By lowering your price slightly to $935,000, you show continued flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer positions you as being willing to meet Bob halfway between your previous offer and his last offer.
* **Highlighting the Deal:**  Emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect for both parties to make the offer more appealing.

This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still safeguarding your minimum requirement. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $915,000 is still below your minimum.  While you've shown flexibility in negotiations, it seems unlikely that you'll be able to get a significantly higher offer from Bob.  It's more strategic to take the guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000.  This ensures you meet your minimum and avoid further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
