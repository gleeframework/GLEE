# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure a high-quality item valued at $12,000 for a competitive price. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,500.
