"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,500. This still represents a significant discount from the original value of $12,000, while also reflecting the value we place on this transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
