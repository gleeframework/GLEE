Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale! I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $150, I'm leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.
* **Confidence and Value:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's worth and sets the stage for a potentially successful transaction.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer or decision. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider:

* **Lowering the price:** If Bob's counteroffer is reasonable, I might be willing to negotiate.
* **Sticking to my price:** If Bob's offer is significantly lower, I might try to hold firm or offer a small concession.
* **Exiting the negotiation:** If Bob's offer is unacceptable, I'll consider selling to John for $100 to avoid losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Out for More:** While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still significantly lower than my desired value. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown interest, and there's room to negotiate further. I believe I can get closer to my target price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll make a counteroffer, likely somewhere between $120 and $150, to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Consider Factors:**  I'll factor in Bob's financial constraints and the value of the product to me when formulating my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down to $135. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $150 to $135, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing justification for the price, emphasizing the value of the product to strengthen my position. 
* **Test the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially reach a deal close to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his decision. If he rejects my counteroffer:

* **Consider Further Concessions:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to $135, I might consider further concessions.
* **Stick to My Price:** If Bob's offer is significantly lower, I'll likely hold firm at $135.
* **Exit Negotiations:** If Bob's offers consistently fall far below my desired value, I'll consider selling to John to avoid losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $135 is the best price for the product. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $100 matches the price John is willing to pay.  
* **No Upside:** There's no incentive to continue negotiating with Bob since I can sell to John for the same price and avoid further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John to finalize the sale and secure the $100, ensuring I don't lose out on a guaranteed deal while trying to squeeze more out of Bob."
