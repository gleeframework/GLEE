Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a chance to counteroffer without feeling like he's being pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your initial ask, it's still above your minimum threshold of $80 and closer to your desired price. It's a good compromise that secures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
