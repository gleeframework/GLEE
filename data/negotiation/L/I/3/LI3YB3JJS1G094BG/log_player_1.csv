"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum price ($1,000,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price provides room for negotiation and potential counteroffers, allowing us to hopefully find a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value while being open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming higher. I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer, especially since we're only in Round 2. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to signal I'm not willing to drop the price drastically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I believe the product's unique qualities and potential warrant a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to consider $1,275,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's value and your interest."", ""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I've reduced my price slightly but am holding relatively firm to demonstrate the value I place on the product.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  The $1,275,000 counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous price, encouraging him to move closer to my target.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and collaborative, emphasizing a win-win solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,225,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,225,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price.
* **""Highest I'm Willing to Go"":** Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Dragging this out risks losing Bob without guaranteeing a better offer. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer provides an extra $225,000.

It's time to secure a favorable deal rather than risking a lower outcome."
