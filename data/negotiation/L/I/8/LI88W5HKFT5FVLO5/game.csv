"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and the benefits it can bring to my business. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider my offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  This price still leaves significant value for you, while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
