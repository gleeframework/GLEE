I believe this is a fair price, considering the market value and the benefits it can bring to my business. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider my offer.

I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is not willing to come up much higher than $950,000. It's not worth continuing to negotiate.  I will sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
