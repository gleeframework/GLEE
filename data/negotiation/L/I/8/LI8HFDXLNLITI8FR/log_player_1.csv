Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price below my minimum."

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I want to avoid risking losing the deal altogether.  It's important to keep in mind that John is a secure option, but Bob's offer provides a higher return."
