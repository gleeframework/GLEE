"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value to you and my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a reasonable compromise. This allows you to still make a profit while staying within my price range. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,4,
