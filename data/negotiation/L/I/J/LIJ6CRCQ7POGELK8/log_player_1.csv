Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $1,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Initial Offer:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) gives me room to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:** The offer is open to counteroffers, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Plan B:** The backup option of selling to John for $1,200,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value to you and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, potentially at $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point that is closer to my desired value. 
* **Time is Money:** I'm willing to engage in a back-and-forth with Bob as long as it doesn't drag out too long. If the negotiations become protracted or unproductive, I'll switch to Plan B and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counter-offering at $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,000,000, but still well above Bob's current offer.
* **Message:** The message is polite and acknowledges Bob's position while emphasizing the value of the product. It also aims to build a sense of partnership in reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** The counteroffer bridges the gap between our respective positions, demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground. 
* **Time is Money (Again):** I'm remaining committed to negotiations while still keeping in mind the potential opportunity cost of delaying the sale to John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I maintain some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a reasonable compromise. This allows you to still make a profit while staying within my price range. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Time is Money:** Prolonging the negotiation might result in a higher offer, but it also risks losing the deal completely.  
* **Profit vs. Risk:** Accepting $900,000 provides a significant profit while mitigating the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $1,200,000.
* **Finality:** Accepting the offer allows me to move on to other ventures without further delay."
