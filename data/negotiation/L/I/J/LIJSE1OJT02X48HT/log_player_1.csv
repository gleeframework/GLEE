Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a very unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first, before exploring other options. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,000,000?  This price reflects its potential and the value it could bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value it could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $500,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $500,000 is unfortunately too far below the value I've assessed for this unique offering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $750,000 would be the absolute minimum I can accept. This price still reflects the product's potential and the significant benefit it could bring to your business. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $625000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $625,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe the product is worth more.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product and I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $625,000 is closer but still falls short of my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $700,000 to demonstrate my commitment to a deal. This price reflects the unique value of the product and provides both of us with a solid return on investment. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your commitment to the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $675000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $675,000 is getting close, I'm still within my 10 rounds and can push for a slightly higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my minimum value of $800,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and we're getting closer to a deal.  $675,000 is still a bit below my minimum value, but I'm willing to compromise one last time.  I'll offer $687,500.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and it's crucial for me to get as close as possible to the product's true value.  Let's try to finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 687500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $687500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer of $670000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, as $670,000 is very close to my minimum value. However, with only two rounds left, I risk not being able to get a higher price, and I'm not sure if Bob is going to budge any further. Given the time constraint, and the fact that John is willing to pay $800,000, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John."
