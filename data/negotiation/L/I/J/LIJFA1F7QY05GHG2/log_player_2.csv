"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  $15,000 is well above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my $8,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to go up to $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it's still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  To be honest, I have another offer for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can get the product for $8,000 from John. I'm holding out for a lower price from Alice, but I'm also prepared to walk away if it doesn't happen."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10000}
