Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the value you mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit lower and offer $1,140,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,140,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,140,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,140,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
