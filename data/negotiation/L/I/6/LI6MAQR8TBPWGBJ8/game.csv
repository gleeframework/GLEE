"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,150,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to work with you to make it happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
