{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) while still being attractive to Bob. 

I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob. This allows me to be firm in my negotiations and potentially push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While it's tempting to accept his offer for the sake of a quick deal, I'm confident that I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product is worth less to you than it is to me, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm firm on my price. It's also important to reiterate the value of the product to me, reminding Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000, which is a compromise that meets us halfway.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I have a reliable buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
