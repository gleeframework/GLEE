"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a good price, but I'm still looking to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $13000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I need to know that you're willing to sell it to me for that price. Can you confirm that you'll sell it to me for $12500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your hesitation, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12750. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $12500, Alice. I'm starting to think that I'll have to look elsewhere for this product. Can you really say that $12750 is your final compromise, or are you willing to meet me at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I've already compromised as much as I can. I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12500. I'm willing to make one final offer: $12900. This is my absolute limit, and I'm not willing to budge any further.",12900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $12500, Alice. I'm not going to go any higher. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. I'm willing to walk away from this deal and buy the product from John for $15000. Is there anything you can do to change my mind?",12500.0,Bob,10,
