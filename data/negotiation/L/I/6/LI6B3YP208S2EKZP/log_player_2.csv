"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and Alice is offering it for $11,500, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close as possible to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($10,000) without going below it.  A counteroffer of $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a $1,000 gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway by offering $10,750, which is the average of Alice's offer ($11,000) and his previous offer ($10,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher. How about $10,900? That's a very small difference and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,750.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the difference is only $150.  At this point, it's a good idea to accept the offer and avoid risking losing the deal to John, especially considering only 5 rounds remain."
