Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
