"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $1,300,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll move on to another buyer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
