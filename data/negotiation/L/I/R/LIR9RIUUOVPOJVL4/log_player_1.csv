Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Counter:**  A price of $120 might be enticing enough for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above his $80 valuation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions you well. If Bob rejects it, you can always fall back on selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
