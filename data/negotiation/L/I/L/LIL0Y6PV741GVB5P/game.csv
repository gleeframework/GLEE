"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you've indicated. I believe this offers a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a distance from what I have in mind.  This product offers significant value, and to reach an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a substantial reduction, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This is a substantial amount and reflects the value I place on the product. It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
