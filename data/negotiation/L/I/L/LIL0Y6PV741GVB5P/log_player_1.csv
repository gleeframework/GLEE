Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you've indicated. I believe this offers a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000.  This is a substantial amount and reflects the value I place on the product. It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reached our minimum acceptable price. There's no need to continue negotiating with him as we already have John willing to pay $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer ensures we receive our desired price."
