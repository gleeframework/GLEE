"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This feels like a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a fantastic deal for a product you won't find elsewhere at this price. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,5,
