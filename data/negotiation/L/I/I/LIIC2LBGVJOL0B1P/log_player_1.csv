"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and creates the perception of value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $18,000, there's a good chance Bob will negotiate. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a backup buyer. If Bob isn't budging, you can always walk away and get your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below both your minimum ($12,000) and your initial asking price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's message indicates interest. By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate but not at such a low price. 
* **John as leverage:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John allows you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This feels like a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but strategic reduction:**  We're coming down by $4,000, showing Bob we're flexible and want to make a deal.
* **Still above the minimum:**  The $14,000 counteroffer keeps us comfortably above your $12,000 minimum and closer to a potentially agreeable range.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob increased his offer, $9,000 is still considerably less than your $12,000 baseline.
* **Slow progress:** Bob's increments suggest he might be willing to go higher, but we need to push him further.
* **John's offer as leverage:**  The guaranteed $12,000 from John allows you to hold firm and aim for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a fantastic deal for a product you won't find elsewhere at this price. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** By going directly to your minimum price ($12,000), you signal that this is your best offer. You are being firm but fair.
* **Highlighting value:** You're re-emphasizing the product's unique value and the great deal you're offering.
* **Time constraint:**  With more than half the rounds gone, it's time to apply some pressure. Bob needs to understand this is a take-it-or-leave-it situation.  
* **John's offer in the background:**  While you don't mention John directly, knowing you have that option provides you with a strong position in the negotiation."
