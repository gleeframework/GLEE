Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This feels like a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a fantastic deal for a product you won't find elsewhere at this price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her bottom line of $12,000.  While this might be a good deal in general, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no point in negotiating further with Alice if you're not willing to pay more than John's price."
