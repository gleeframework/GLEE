Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product for a limited time. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to potentially earn more than your fallback option (selling to John).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $120 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, or for you to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob and presents the offer as a potential win-win.

This approach aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
