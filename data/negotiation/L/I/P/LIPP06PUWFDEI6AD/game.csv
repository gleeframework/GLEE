"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, while I still make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
