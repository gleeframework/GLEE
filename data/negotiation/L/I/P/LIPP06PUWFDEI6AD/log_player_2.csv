"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, while I still make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. By buying from John, I can save $50,000 and avoid further negotiation."
