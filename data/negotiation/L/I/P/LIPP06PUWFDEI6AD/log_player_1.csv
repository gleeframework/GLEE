Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, while I still make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down, while still making a significant profit.
* **Appealing to both sides:** My message highlights the benefits for both of us, emphasizing the deal's value for Bob and the profit for me. This approach aims to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Openness for negotiation:** I invite Bob to express his thoughts, signaling that I'm open to negotiation and ready to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. My goal will be to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible before moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while remaining within a range that still benefits him. I will need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise to ensure a sale."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $800,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above my minimum price.  
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting that this price still allows me to make a profit, reinforcing the deal's value. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to find common ground, signaling that I'm open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, the deal is closed at $1,100,000.
* **Rejection:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation. If I feel there's still room for negotiation, I'll make another counteroffer. However, if Bob continues to refuse to budge, I'll need to consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation window closing:**  Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but there's still room for improvement.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting allows me to maintain leverage and potentially push for a higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer aiming for a price closer to my desired price. I will need to carefully consider the risk of losing the deal to John."
