"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $15000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's potential to get it for less. By rejecting, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to lower her price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product.  However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13500?  That's still a good value for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and get a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower, especially if she's eager to sell the product."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $13,500 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which I believe is fair given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
