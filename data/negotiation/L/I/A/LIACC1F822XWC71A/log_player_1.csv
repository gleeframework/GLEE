{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $10,000 is far below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum value.  I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price too far below what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but it's getting closer to my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $12,000, as I feel I can still get a slightly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows him I'm serious about getting as close to my minimum as possible. It's also a good test to see if he's really willing to go that extra bit to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough to make it worth the risk of further negotiation.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $12,000.  I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
