{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong price that's still below the value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. The friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you see in it. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement over selling to John and gets me closer to my desired profit margin."
