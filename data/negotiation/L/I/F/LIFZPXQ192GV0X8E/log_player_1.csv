Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just state a price, it hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $16,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing the final price closer to your minimum but still higher than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
