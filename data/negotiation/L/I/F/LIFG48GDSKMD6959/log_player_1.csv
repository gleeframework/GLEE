Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so he might be willing to pay a bit more than $115.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher starting price could make Bob less interested. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay up to $100 for it. Could we possibly work towards that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your desired price. 

**Reasoning:**

* You have a small buffer: You can afford to reject Bob's offer and potentially negotiate a higher price.
* Selling to John is a fallback: You have a guaranteed buyer in John, but you can try to maximize your earnings with Bob first. 

Let's see if you can get Bob to come up a bit on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is definitely a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $110 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a good strategy for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** You're coming down from your previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $110 is still above your desired minimum of $100.
* **It's a reasonable jump:**  The difference between $100 and $110 is smaller than the previous jump, making it less likely to be rejected outright.

Let's see if this counteroffer gets you closer to your goal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up. I'm still very interested in the product and would like to keep our negotiations going. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** $105 is very close to your desired price of $110, and significantly higher than your minimum of $100.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that Bob will come up further in price, and the risk of him rejecting another offer or you getting stuck at $100 is high.
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation could take time and effort, which might not be worth it for the small potential increase in price.

This offer is a good compromise that allows you to sell the product at a price that's favorable to you."
