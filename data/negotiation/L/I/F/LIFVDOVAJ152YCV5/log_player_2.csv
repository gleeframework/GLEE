"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get an even better price. It's always worth trying to negotiate further, especially when the maximum price is $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for a potential compromise that would be beneficial for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still a good deal for Bob.  Buying from John would cost $1,500,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $400,000.  Further negotiation might save a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
