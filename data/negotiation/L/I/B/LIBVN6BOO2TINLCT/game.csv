"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,650,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,1,
