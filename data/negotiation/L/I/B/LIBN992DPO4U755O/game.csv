"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $875,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something closer to $900,000. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $887,500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
