Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This is a firm offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** This price allows for some potential counteroffers from Bob while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Firm Offer:**  Stating it's a firm offer indicates I'm serious and not looking for a lengthy back-and-forth. However, ""open to hearing your thoughts"" shows a willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer, taking into account his value ($800,000) and my minimum acceptable price.
* If he doesn't offer enough, I'll counter with a slightly lower price, trying to find a middle ground.
* If the negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting a good price, I'll move on to John and sell him the product for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option available to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also close to his perceived value of $800,000.  
* **Final Offer:** While he claims it's his final offer, there's a good chance he's willing to negotiate further. I can leverage my position and try to get a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I could potentially get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I will counter with a price somewhere between $950,000 and $1,000,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise but still puts me closer to my desired price.
* **Be Firm:** I'll emphasize that this is a fair price given the value of the product. I'll also reiterate that I have a backup buyer in John.
* **Watch for Signs:** I'll carefully monitor Bob's responses to gauge his true interest and determine if a further counteroffer is necessary.  If he continues to stall or refuses to budge, I will sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another option, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to remind Bob of its worth and encourage him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Focus on the Deal:**  Instead of focusing on his ""final offer,"" I frame the message as an opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:** I'll carefully assess Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  If he's willing to negotiate, I'll be prepared to adjust my price slightly.
* **Don't Hesitate to Move On:**  If Bob continues to be inflexible or makes a counteroffer that's too low, I'll proceed with selling the product to John.  It's crucial to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price."
