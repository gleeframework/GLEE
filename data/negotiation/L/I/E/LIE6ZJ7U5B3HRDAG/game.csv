"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a steal considering its potential benefits to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects its worth to me, while also acknowledging your concerns about the price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm offering it to you for $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to me.",815000.0,Alice,5,
