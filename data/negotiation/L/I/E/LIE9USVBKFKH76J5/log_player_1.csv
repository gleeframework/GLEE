Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $15,000 allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is structured to gauge Bob's interest and invite a counter-offer,  giving you more information to work with. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Value:** While Bob values the product at $12,000, is there a chance it's worth more in the broader market? Researching comparable products can inform your pricing strategy.
* **Bob's Urgency:**  If you sense Bob might be in a hurry or strongly desires the product, you might be able to maintain a higher price."
