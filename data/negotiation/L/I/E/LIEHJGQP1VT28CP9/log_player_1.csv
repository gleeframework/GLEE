"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  My price is $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. 
* **Fairness:** Using the word ""fair"" subtly implies that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation.** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.
* **No rush to sell.**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:**  I reiterate that $1,100,000 is unacceptable, but I'm open to compromise.
* **Split the Difference:** Suggesting a price that's midway between our last offers shows good faith and encourages a middle ground.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  Again, I use ""fair"" to imply a willingness to reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable, but $1,250,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle on $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still below my desired outcome.
* **More negotiation room:** I have 6 rounds left and there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John now guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can reach a price closer to $1,250,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,212,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful it will be acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 1212500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Counter-Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise while still maintaining a firm stance.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlight Compromise:** Emphasizing my ""significant compromise"" shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but not give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  $1,212,500 is still a bit rich for me.  Let's try this - $1,190,000.  If that works for you, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to 4 rounds, and I need to be strategic.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can push for a price closer to my desired outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer in the next round that balances being firm but also willing to compromise a bit more. I need to push Bob toward my desired price range while remaining aware of the limited time remaining."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit. However, $1,190,000 is still a little too far from where I need to be. I understand that we're getting closer, and I'm willing to make one last compromise.  Let's split the difference once more.  I'm offering the product for $1,201,250.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it will be acceptable to you."", ""product_price"": 1201250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm continuing to use the ""split the difference"" tactic. It shows flexibility and can lead to a faster resolution.
* **Final Compromise:**  I'm framing this as my ""final compromise"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards accepting. 
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While I'm offering a compromise, the price is still above my minimum and close to my desired outcome.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 3 rounds left, I need to work towards a deal quickly."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  How about this as my final offer - $1,195,000.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,195,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,195,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not yet:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to 2 rounds, and I need to be strategic. I'm still hoping to push Bob higher. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I think there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price range.

**Next Steps:**

I need to carefully craft a counteroffer that balances firmness with a desire to reach a deal before I run out of time. My goal is to push Bob as close as possible to $1,200,000 or higher."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I respect that.  However, $1,195,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  To be honest, I'm surprised you're not willing to come up just a bit more, considering the value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  If you can increase your offer to $1,200,000, we have a deal. If not, I'm going to have to seriously consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I reiterate that Bob's offer is too low, but I'm open to a very small compromise.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm appealing to Bob's logic by reminding him of the value the product holds for him. This might push him to reconsider.
* **Finality and Urgency:**  I emphasize that this is my ""last"" offer to increase the pressure.
* **Limited Rounds:** This is our last chance to negotiate before selling to John, so I need to be persuasive."
