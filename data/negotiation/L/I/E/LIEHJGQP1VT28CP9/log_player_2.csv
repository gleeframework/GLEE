Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer the product for $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,175,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to come down to $1,212,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful it will be acceptable to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit. However, $1,190,000 is still a little too far from where I need to be. I understand that we're getting closer, and I'm willing to make one last compromise.  Let's split the difference once more.  I'm offering the product for $1,201,250.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, and I respect that.  However, $1,195,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  To be honest, I'm surprised you're not willing to come up just a bit more, considering the value this product holds for you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  If you can increase your offer to $1,200,000, we have a deal. If not, I'm going to have to seriously consider my other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is clearly demonstrating a strong stance on her bottom line. While there's a chance to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal. Accepting at $1,200,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
