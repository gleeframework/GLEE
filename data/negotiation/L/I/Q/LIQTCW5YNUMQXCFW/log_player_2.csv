"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than John's price, you can likely get a better deal from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room for negotiation."
