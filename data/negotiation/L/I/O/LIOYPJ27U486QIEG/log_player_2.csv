"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $1,150,000 is a substantial discount, but still leaves room for Alice to potentially profit. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while also being aggressive in his price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer from the previous round, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. While the new offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still better than buying from John. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice the price that she values the product at.  This is a good compromise point, as it demonstrates Bob's willingness to meet halfway while still securing a significant discount from his initial budget.  This counteroffer creates pressure on Alice, potentially leading her to accept and finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer again, but it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and shouldn't be pressured into accepting a price that's not favorable. Continuing the negotiation process could potentially get Alice to budge closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. However, the price is still below Alice's last offer and closer to his desired price point. This counteroffer demonstrates a continued commitment to negotiating while not conceding too much. It puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and while Bob has been able to get Alice to lower her price, the offers are still too high for his budget. Alice seems unwilling to meet Bob's desired price point. With only a few rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget and avoiding further negotiation delays."
