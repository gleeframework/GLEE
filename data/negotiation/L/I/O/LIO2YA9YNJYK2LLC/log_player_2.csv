"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John.  Even though negotiating with Alice might lead to a better price, it's not worth the risk of losing the opportunity to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's original price and is still within Bob's budget.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll get a better price from Alice. Accepting $950,000 saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
