Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** $1,000,000 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It creates space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a back-and-forth dialogue.
* **It sets a high initial standard:** By starting at a high price, you signal that you're confident in the product's value and are not desperate for a quick sale.

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while still being open to reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I will counteroffer with a higher price, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise. It's still higher than Bob's last offer, but it's closer to his valuation, which might encourage him to accept. This is a strategic move to bridge the gap and see if we can finalize the deal."
