I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point considering the product is worth $15,000 to me."

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $11,500. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm worried that if I continue to negotiate, he might walk away."
