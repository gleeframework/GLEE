Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  How about $11,000? I believe that's a fair price considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I think we can finalize this quickly. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
