"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance:

* **Significant Price Drop:**  The jump from $14,000 to $11,000 is substantial and signals that you're serious about a lower price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  It leaves space for further negotiation. Alice might counter, but it's unlikely she'll go straight back up to $14,000.
* **Below John's Price:** It keeps you well below your alternative option of buying from John at $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met you in the middle, and $12,500 is a solid deal. It's unlikely you'll get a much better price from Alice, and it keeps you well under your maximum budget and what John offers."
