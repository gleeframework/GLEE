"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its worth to both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being a significant discount from your initial offer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still ensuring a fair deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your initial offer was $1,400,000 and your new offer is $1,325,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,312,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to both of us.",1312500.0,Bob,4,
