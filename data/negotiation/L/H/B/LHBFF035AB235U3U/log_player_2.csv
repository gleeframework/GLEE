Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,500,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is a strong signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but that I'm not willing to go above my budget. It's a crucial round as it's my final offer before considering John's offer. If Alice rejects this, I'll move to John to ensure I get the product."
