"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $9,000 is a good starting point. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it shows Bob is serious about negotiating.  It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  However, it's closer to his target price.  There's still room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.  By offering $10,500, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money. This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, and only $500 over his target price.  Further negotiation might get a slightly better price, but it's not guaranteed.  Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continuing to negotiate."
