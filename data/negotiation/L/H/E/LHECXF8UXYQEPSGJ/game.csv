"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and what I'm willing to pay. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for you, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000. How about $12,500? This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
