# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.

I believe this is still a fair price considering the value you've described."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to counter one more time to see if we can reach an agreement. I want to try to push her down further, but I'm also concerned about running out of rounds and having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,320,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $1,280,000. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, while also respecting our respective needs.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1280000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds and Alice is still above my budget.  It's likely we won't be able to reach an agreement.  Given that John is selling for my maximum price, it's best to secure the deal with him to avoid the risk of not getting the product at all."
