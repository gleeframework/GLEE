"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's closer to his target price and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might save a little more, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
