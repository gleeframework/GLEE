"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $95 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your offer, but I think $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I would like to propose $92.50 as a compromise. This allows us to stay within my budget while providing you with a reasonable profit margin. I hope you can accept this offer.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept. Let's meet in the middle at $95. It's a fair price that both of us can be happy with. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
