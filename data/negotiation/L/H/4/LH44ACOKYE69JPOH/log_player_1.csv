Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $95 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob. $95 is closer to my ideal price, but I think I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $95 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 97.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer, but I think $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I would like to propose $92.50 as a compromise. This allows us to stay within my budget while providing you with a reasonable profit margin. I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired amount, so I'm going to counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $92.50 is still a bit lower than I'd like to accept. Let's meet in the middle at $95. It's a fair price that both of us can be happy with. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
