"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can offer you a compromise at $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you consider $130?  I think that's a fair price that we can both be happy with.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that $130 is getting closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount at $135, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",135.0,Alice,5,
