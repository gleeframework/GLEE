"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's best to see if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal, and you have 9 rounds left to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to do $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. By offering $125, you're showing Alice you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're willing to negotiate.  This is a reasonable starting point,  as you have a 10-round limit and want to be sure you get the best price possible within your $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can offer you a compromise at $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $140 is still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to lower the price further. You have 7 rounds left to reach a deal that's better than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you consider $130?  I think that's a fair price that we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show Alice you're serious about buying but still trying to get the best possible price.  You're moving closer to her last offer, but still within your budget and with room to negotiate if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that $130 is getting closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount at $135, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good deal considering your budget of $150 and the fact that you have the option to buy from John for that price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a lower price, and you still have a few rounds left in case you want to negotiate further."
