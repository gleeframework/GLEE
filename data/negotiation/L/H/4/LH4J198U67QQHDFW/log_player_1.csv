Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate upwards if Bob rejects your initial offer.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  A strong initial offer helps establish your position and sets the tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, you can consider lowering the price slightly to try and get a deal, or you can stick to your minimum and see if he's willing to come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still significantly less than what you're hoping for. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before selling to John. You can try to meet him halfway, but keep in mind that you're still in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a great price for you, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still significantly less than your minimum value, it's a good compromise. You've successfully negotiated a higher price than Bob's initial offer, and it's very likely that he won't go higher.  Selling to John would guarantee you a higher price, but it would also require you to end the negotiation with Bob. This might be a good strategy if you were confident you could find another buyer like John in the future, but it's not clear if that's the case here.  

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and secure a sale without risking losing a potential customer."
