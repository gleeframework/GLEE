"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **You value the product at $100.**
* **Alice's offer is $90.** This is a better deal than buying from John for $100. 
* **Even though Alice values the product at $80, that's irrelevant to your decision.** Your focus is on getting the best price for yourself."
