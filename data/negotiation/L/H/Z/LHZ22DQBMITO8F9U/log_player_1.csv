Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth much more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is more than my minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value to Bob, making it more enticing for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can still get a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $9,250, and is within my acceptable range.  It's a good deal for both of us, and accepting it will allow me to close the deal quickly."
