Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with your purchase."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($10,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have the safety net of John who will buy the product at our minimum price, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, we maximize our chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
