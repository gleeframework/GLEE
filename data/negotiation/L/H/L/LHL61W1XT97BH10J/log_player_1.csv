Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm very interested in the product and willing to pay up to $800,000.  This price reflects my maximum budget and would be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
