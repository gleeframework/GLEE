"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a significant value proposition given the product's worth to you and its market value. We believe this price reflects both the quality of the product and the opportunity it presents for you. We look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value proposition, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm very interested in the product and willing to pay up to $800,000.  This price reflects my maximum budget and would be a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
