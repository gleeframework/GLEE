Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible without him rejecting the offer. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $149 is just below your guaranteed sale price to John. This maximizes the chance Bob accepts while still securing a near-optimal profit."
