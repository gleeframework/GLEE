Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with my highest possible price, knowing I can always go lower if necessary.  Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate, as he values the product at $1,000,000.  However, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob wants the product, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not giving away too much.  I believe Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap and secure a sale."

I'm offering a price that's a little closer to Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm still holding firm on my minimum value for the product.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize that this is a fair price and accept the offer."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum.  I've already made significant concessions and I'm not confident that further negotiation will yield a better price.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
