Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm looking to get $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a price higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I am willing to pay $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
This is a good opportunity to secure a decent price from Bob.  While $110 is less than your original asking price, it's more than your minimum and significantly better than selling to John for $100."
