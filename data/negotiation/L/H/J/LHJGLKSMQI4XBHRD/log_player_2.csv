You can likely get a better price than $120, so it's worth trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You can still try to get a better price. Even $100 is a better deal than buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a good value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is a good deal compared to John's price of $150.  While you could keep negotiating, the risk is that Alice will get frustrated and walk away, leaving you with only the option to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
