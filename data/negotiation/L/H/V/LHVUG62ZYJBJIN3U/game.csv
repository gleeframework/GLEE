"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $130? It's a bit higher than your initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this, how about we settle on $115?  That way, we both get a fair deal and I can finally get my hands on this product.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I want to give you a slight discount since you've been a good negotiator. I'll sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",125.0,Alice,5,
