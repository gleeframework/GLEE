,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  That's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $700,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $900,000. This would still give you a good profit margin, and it would allow me to recoup some of my investment.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
