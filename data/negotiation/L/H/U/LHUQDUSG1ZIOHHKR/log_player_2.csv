Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet halfway, I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
