"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $1,200,000. I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this deal work. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet halfway, I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
