"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to you, and I get a fair price for my hard work. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $850,000 for this product. This still represents a significant savings for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
