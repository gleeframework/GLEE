"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to do $8,500? It's still a good price for you, and would make this deal work for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could be persuaded to come down a bit more, but $8,750 is pushing it. How about $8,900 and we have a deal?",8900.0,Alice,5,
