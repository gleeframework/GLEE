"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and gives me a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While I could sell to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range by continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **I still have room to maneuver.**  I have 8 rounds remaining, and Bob clearly sees the value of the product.  There's a good chance we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $9,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $8,750. This offer keeps us quite close to the middle and would allow me to make the purchase today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.** This is a good deal for me, considering my alternative is selling to John for $8,000.
* **We're getting closer to a deal.**  Bob's offer is within my desired price range, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in smaller increments, making it less worthwhile. 
* **Time is running out.**  While I have 6 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to offer a higher price.  It's better to secure this deal than risk losing out on a better offer and having to accept John's offer in the end."
