Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value you see in the product.
