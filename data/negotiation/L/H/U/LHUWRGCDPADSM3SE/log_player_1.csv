Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning another buyer (""John"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Deadline:** Setting a deadline prevents Bob from stalling and forces a decision. 

**Important Considerations:**

* The ""reasonable deadline"" should depend on the context of the sale and your typical sales cycle.
*  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he counters, you can adjust your price slightly downward, but always stay above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000)."
