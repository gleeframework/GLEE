I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  I'll accept his offer and get the deal done."
