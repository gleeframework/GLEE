Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject this offer, leading you to sell to John for $800,000. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price from Bob makes this a calculated risk."
