"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $925,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,000,000
* **John's Price:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John results in the same price ($1,000,000). Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice, but the prompt doesn't give you the option to do that."
