"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm hoping to get closer to my $14,000 price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a final agreement. I want to get as close to my $15,000 goal as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate that.  $12,250 is a good start, but I'm still looking to get closer to $14,000.  How about we compromise at $13,500? This will give you a great deal and allow me to get closer to my goal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so how about we try $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm starting to run out of time.  It's unlikely he'll come up to my desired price point.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  That's my minimum price, and it's a guaranteed sale."
