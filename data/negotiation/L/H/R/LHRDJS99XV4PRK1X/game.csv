"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate that.  $12,250 is a good start, but I'm still looking to get closer to $14,000.  How about we compromise at $13,500? This will give you a great deal and allow me to get closer to my goal.  Let's make this happen!",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so how about we try $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,
