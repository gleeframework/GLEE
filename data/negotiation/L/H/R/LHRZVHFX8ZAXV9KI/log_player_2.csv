"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 
Alice's offer is still above my ideal price point, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise given our respective values.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  Let's finalize this deal, I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my ideal price of $800,000 and is within my budget of $800,000.  While I could keep negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will walk away, or that I will run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, and I will still be saving $75,000 compared to buying from John."
