"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my needs?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it gets me closer to my target price. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still unable to meet you halfway at $13,000. I'd like to stick to my budget of $12,000. Could you possibly lower the price further?",12000.0,Bob,4,
