"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's value of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget of $8,000 as possible. By offering $8,500, he's showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping a bit of room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  While $9,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and try to push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  I'm really interested in this product, but I have to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway by offering $8,750, which is the midpoint between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's offer of $9,000. This shows a sincere effort to reach an agreement while still pushing for a price closer to his ideal."
