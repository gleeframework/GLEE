"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be truly transformative for your business. My asking price is $1,750,000. This reflects the significant value and potential I see in it. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and professional:** Maintains a good negotiating relationship.
* **Signals interest:** Shows you're serious but want a better price.
* **Anchors low:** Starts with a much lower offer to give room for negotiation while staying well below your $1,000,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer of $800,000 is lower than what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm confident this product can deliver significant value for your business.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm proposing $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice has come down considerably, but the price is still above your maximum and what John offers.  It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can see the value in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a stretch for me.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe it could be worthwhile if we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledgement:**  We acknowledge Alice's movement and thank her for her flexibility.
* **Justification:** We reiterate that the price is still a stretch, subtly reminding her we have other options.
* **Compromise:** We increase our offer significantly, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle but still staying below our $1,000,000 walk-away point. 
* **Urgency:**  We hint that we are serious about making a deal but need her to move closer to our range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm convinced this product can generate significant value for your business, and I want to make sure we reach an agreement that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value while allowing for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you're very close to your absolute limit.  John's offer is a guaranteed $1,000,000, making it the safer and more economical choice at this point."
