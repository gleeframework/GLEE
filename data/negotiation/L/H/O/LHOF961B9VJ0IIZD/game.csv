"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product for your consideration. I believe it holds significant potential for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment.  My starting price is $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize the value the product holds for you, $900,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $950,000.  This reflects the product's true worth and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 still doesn't quite reach the value I'm looking for.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $935,000. This offer is a compromise that allows us to both secure a beneficial outcome.  Let's make this deal happen.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $915,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",915000.0,Bob,6,
