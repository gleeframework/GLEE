{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit above Bob's value of $120, leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum of $150, leaving me some wiggle room to negotiate if Bob counters.  This allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John while still ensuring I get at least my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150 and my initial offer of $135. I am willing to negotiate, but $100 is too low. I will counteroffer to try and find a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $120 for it. How about $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
