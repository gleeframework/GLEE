"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $18,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum price in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
