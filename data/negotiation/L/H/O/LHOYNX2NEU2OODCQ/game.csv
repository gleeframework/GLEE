"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $18,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This offer reflects the product's true value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
