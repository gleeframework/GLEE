"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $11,750. This is my final offer, so let me know what you think.",11750.0,Alice,5,
