Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Ensure a Sale:**  The price is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80), ensuring a good profit even if you need to sell to John.

This strategy aims to secure a higher profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
