Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $12,000 allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your knowledge of Bob's valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by inviting Bob's thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  Bob might be willing to pay slightly above his valuation if he perceives the product as valuable and scarce.
* **Negotiation Skills:** This strategy assumes you can negotiate effectively. Be prepared to lower your price if Bob shows resistance, but don't go below $10,000 (your guaranteed sale price to John). 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering the information you have about Bob's valuation."
