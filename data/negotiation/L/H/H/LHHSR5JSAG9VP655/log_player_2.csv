"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. It's a great value considering its worth to us is $150, and it would be a fantastic addition to your collection. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits you'll receive from using it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $140, especially since you have John as an alternative.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To better align with your offer, I am willing to consider $130 as the price for the product. I believe this still captures some of the value we place on it while being more accessible to your current budget.

While Alice has lowered her price, you're still within your budget and can likely get it for less.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try for a lower price again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $130 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm confident I can get it for $128.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. In an effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am prepared to offer the product at $129. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us, while being more accommodating to your financial situation. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:

You're so close to your target price of $120 with John. Keep negotiating with Alice, you might be able to get her down to $125 or even $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hoping to get it for $125. It's a fair price, considering my budget and your need to move this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your budgetary concerns and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering all factors, I propose to sell the product for $126. I believe this offers a good balance between fairness and profitability for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is only offering $126, which is still higher than John's price of $120. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate, as you might not be able to get a better deal from Alice. You can save $6 by buying from John."
