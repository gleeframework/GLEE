"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of getting a better price.  You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely."
