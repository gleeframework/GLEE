Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $875,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as our fallback option, John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get Bob closer to our desired price, and we risk him lowering his offer further. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
