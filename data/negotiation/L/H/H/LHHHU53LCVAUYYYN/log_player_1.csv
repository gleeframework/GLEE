Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it's still significantly more than my minimum.
