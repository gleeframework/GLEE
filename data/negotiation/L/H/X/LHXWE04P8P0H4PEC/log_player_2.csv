"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you have a budget to consider. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $100, which is within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice might not come down further, and I could end up paying John's $120. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
