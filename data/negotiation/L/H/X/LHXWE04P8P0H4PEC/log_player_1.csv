Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $120, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This creates a chance for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is above your minimum of $80, it's still lower than the price you'd like to get. You have room to negotiate further.  There's a good chance Bob is willing to go a bit higher, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you have a budget to consider. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}
