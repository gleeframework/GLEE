Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1050000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.
