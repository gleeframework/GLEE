"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in your product, but I can't justify paying that much. To be serious, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1050000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to pay a fair price, but $950000 is the highest I can go at this point.  If you're willing to consider this, we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1050000? No, wait, I remember our previous conversation... I'll make a new offer, $1050000 is too high. Let's try $990000. It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $990000 is closer, but still above my budget.  I'm prepared to make a final offer of $975000. If that's acceptable, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll have to go with John's offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
