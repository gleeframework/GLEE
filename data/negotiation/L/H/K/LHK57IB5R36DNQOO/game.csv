"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is close, but to be honest, anything over $1,000,000 just doesn't make sense for me.  I'm prepared to offer you $975,000.  It's a fair offer, and I think it's the furthest I can go.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made concessions and I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between $1,050,000 and $975,000. I'll sell the product to you for $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
