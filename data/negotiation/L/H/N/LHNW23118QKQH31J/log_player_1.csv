{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise: higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a good profit.  I'm also highlighting the value proposition to increase his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to close the gap and get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, aiming for a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the compromise and the mutual benefit of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm willing to negotiate further but am getting close to my limit.  I'll see if I can squeeze out a slightly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to one final adjustment. How about we settle on $9,300? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd be happy with this deal. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer. I'm also subtly reminding Bob about the alternative (selling to John) to incentivize him to accept."
