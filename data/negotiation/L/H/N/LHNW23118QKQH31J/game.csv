"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to one final adjustment. How about we settle on $9,300? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd be happy with this deal. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",9300.0,Alice,5,
