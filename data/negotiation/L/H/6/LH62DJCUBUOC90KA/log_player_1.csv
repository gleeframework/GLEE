"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant and $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see where you're coming from. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffers suggest he's willing to move closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,075,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,112,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end."", 
""product_price"": 1112500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference again, maintaining a steady negotiation pace. This keeps the communication open and signals our willingness to negotiate while pushing for a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,093,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,093,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,093,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently meeting us halfway, showing a strong desire for the product. While we could push for a bit more, accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over John's offer ($293,750 more) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
