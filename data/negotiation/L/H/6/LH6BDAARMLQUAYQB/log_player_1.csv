I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached my limit in negotiations.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and saves me the time and effort of further negotiations."
