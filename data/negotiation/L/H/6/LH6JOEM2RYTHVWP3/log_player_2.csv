"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $130. I think it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a reasonably aggressive counteroffer to try and gauge Alice's flexibility.  We're still well below our maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better, we're still aiming lower. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $105?  That's a significant step from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

We're moving closer to the middle ground, showing Alice that we're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price close to our target."
