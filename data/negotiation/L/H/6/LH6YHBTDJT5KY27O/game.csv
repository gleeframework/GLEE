"I understand your desire to get closer to the original price, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your initial offer was $1,150,000 and my previous offer was $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $1,120,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1120000.0,Bob,4,
