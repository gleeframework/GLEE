"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return on your investment.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product has value, but I see it closer to $800,000. Would you consider an offer in that range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a more realistic valuation while still acknowledging the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your willingness to move on price is encouraging. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly as well. Let's say $1,725,000, and I think we can have a deal.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
