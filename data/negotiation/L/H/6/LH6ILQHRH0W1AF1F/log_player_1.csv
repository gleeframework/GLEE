"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  Starting high shows you value the product highly and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This price sets a high anchor point, making subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (even if brief) for the high price adds a sense of value. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting price"" implies you're willing to negotiate.

By starting high, Alice maximizes her potential earnings while still leaving room to reach a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product has value, but I see it closer to $800,000. Would you consider an offer in that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my valuation and his own stated perception of the product's value. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a more realistic valuation while still acknowledging the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but strategic reduction:** The large reduction ($350,000) shows willingness to negotiate, while staying significantly above Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price.
* **Reiterating value:**  Continuing to emphasize the product's worth helps justify the higher price. 
* **Setting a new anchor:** This offer aims to shift Bob's perception of a reasonable price point higher.

The goal is to find a middle ground and avoid simply meeting in the middle. Alice wants to maintain a strong position and maximize her potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does my time. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer to a potentially acceptable range, it's still below my guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting now would mean leaving money on the table. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from Bob's side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your willingness to move on price is encouraging. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly as well. Let's say $1,725,000, and I think we can have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1725000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging progress:** Recognizing Bob's movement encourages continued negotiation.
* **Smaller concession:** The reduction of $125,000 is less significant, signaling that I'm approaching my bottom line.
* **Sense of urgency:** Phrasing like ""let's say"" and ""we can have a deal"" aims to nudge Bob towards a close. 

This offer maintains a price well above John's offer, while still offering Bob a significant discount from the initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but I need you to meet me a bit more on this.  How about $1,537,500, and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,537,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,537,500 is now above my guaranteed sale price with John. While I could potentially push for more in further rounds, the difference is relatively small, and there's always the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit above my minimum and avoids the potential risk of continuing the negotiation."
