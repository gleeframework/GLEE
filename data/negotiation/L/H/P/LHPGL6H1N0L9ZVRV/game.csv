"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $115? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.  What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $112.50 is still too far below what I need.  Would you be willing to go up to $114? That's just a small increase, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",114.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but $114 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $114, which would be $113.25. Would you be willing to consider that?",113.25,Bob,6,
