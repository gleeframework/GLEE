"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to consider $1550000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get as close to your asking price as possible. While $1550000 is closer to my limit, I'm only comfortable going up to $1525000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction.",1525000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1525000. I'm willing to consider $1525500, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. What do you think?",1525500.0,Alice,7,
