# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it holds significant value for you given its worth of $100 to you. Considering its quality and benefits, I propose a price of $95 for this product. I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay $95."
