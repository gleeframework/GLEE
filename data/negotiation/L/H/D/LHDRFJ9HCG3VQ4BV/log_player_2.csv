Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the negotiation, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $7,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $9,000.  While you could continue negotiating, you're running the risk of the price remaining high or even Alice becoming less willing to negotiate. John's offer of $12,000 is your safety net, and at this point, it's the best option to ensure you get the product without overpaying."
