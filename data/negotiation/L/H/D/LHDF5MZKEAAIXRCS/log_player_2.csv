"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100,000 less than your max) gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* It also firmly establishes that you're looking for a deal and not willing to pay the initial asking price. 
* The tone is polite and professional, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above your maximum price and what John offers. There's room to negotiate further towards your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($850,000) and your previous offer ($700,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Below Your Maximum:**  It's crucial to remain below your $800,000 limit. This keeps you in a good position, even if you have to go up slightly in future rounds. 
* **Justifying the Offer:** By mentioning your budget, you're providing a reason for your counter-offer, making it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

* **Holding your ground:** By continuing to reject offers above your limit, you're demonstrating your seriousness about your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your patience with me. I've got to be honest,  $825,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I have another offer for a similar product at $800,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I might have to go with the other option."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is your maximum price and matches John's offer. It signals that you're serious and at your limit.
