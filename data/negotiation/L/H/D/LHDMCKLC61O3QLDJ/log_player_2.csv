Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay closer to my budget, but I'm not going to jump at a price that's only slightly lower than John's offer. It's time to counter again."
