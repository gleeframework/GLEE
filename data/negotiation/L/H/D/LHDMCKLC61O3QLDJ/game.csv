"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the product's value, I'm only able to offer $700,000 at this time. This is a fair price given the market value and my current financial capacity. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair price considering the potential return on investment. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  How about we bridge the gap with $825,000?  This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your budget considerations.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $775,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and my financial limitations. Let's make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
