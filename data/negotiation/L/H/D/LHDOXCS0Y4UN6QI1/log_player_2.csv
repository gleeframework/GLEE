"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. It's more than halfway between her value ($800,000) and your maximum ($1,500,000). There's significant room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. Given the value of the product to both of us, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but I need a price that works for my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  While she has moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's better to reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  You're still in a better position than John who is asking for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my comfortable price point. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to your last counteroffer of $1,000,000. It's also significantly lower than John's asking price of $1,500,000.  Given the limited rounds left (only 5 more), it's wise to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price.  There's a chance you could get a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal or having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for a small savings."
