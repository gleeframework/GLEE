"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a more suitable return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,200,000? This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
