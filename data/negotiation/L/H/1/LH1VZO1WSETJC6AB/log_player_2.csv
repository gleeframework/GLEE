Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price still leaves you a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a more suitable return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
