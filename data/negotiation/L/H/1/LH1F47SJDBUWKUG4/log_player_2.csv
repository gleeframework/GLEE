You have three options:

Let's negotiate to get a better price! ðŸ˜„"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for further negotiation. It's important to appear interested while making it clear I'm looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a price I'd accept, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $90 even? That's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between my last offer and Alice's current one. This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we try $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling she's nearing her bottom line.  While I could try to negotiate further, $95 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it."
