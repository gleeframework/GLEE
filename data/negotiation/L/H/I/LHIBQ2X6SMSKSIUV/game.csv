"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't accept $1300000.  The value of this product is significant, and I'm willing to compromise slightly.  How about $1600000?  This would still leave you with a great deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1450000 for the product.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This offer is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while also allowing you a significant discount.  Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
