Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still too far below my minimum of $1,500,000, and I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel we might be able to find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and helps us move forward towards a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but accepting Bob's offer for $1,400,000 is the best choice. It's slightly below my ideal price of $1,500,000, but it's still a substantial profit and it ensures a sale.  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds and the risk of failing to close a deal with Bob is higher if I continue."
