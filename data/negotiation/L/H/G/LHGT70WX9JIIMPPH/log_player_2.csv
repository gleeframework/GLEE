Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might better suit both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $10,200 for the product. This offers a reasonable compromise while still allowing me to maintain a decent profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a higher risk of not getting you a better deal."
