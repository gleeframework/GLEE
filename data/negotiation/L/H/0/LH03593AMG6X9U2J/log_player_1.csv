Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $9,500 offer gives a slight buffer in case Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Strong Alternative:** The guaranteed sale to John for $8,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
