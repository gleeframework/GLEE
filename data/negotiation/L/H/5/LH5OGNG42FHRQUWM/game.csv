"I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I think it's a fair price considering the market value. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a reasonable profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a profit. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
