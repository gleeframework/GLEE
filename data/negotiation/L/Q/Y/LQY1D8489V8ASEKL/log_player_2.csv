{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can negotiate a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a range that might be appealing to her. This gives us some room for negotiation while also staying within my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay from John. However, it's getting closer to my maximum, and it's worth another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  This counteroffer is a compromise that gives me a better price than John's offer, while still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit."
