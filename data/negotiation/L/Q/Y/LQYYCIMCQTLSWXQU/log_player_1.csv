"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm going to counter with $980,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to make it clear that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm not willing to give it away for a bargain price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $960,000 is a good price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing a deal by being too stubborn.  I'm happy with this outcome."
