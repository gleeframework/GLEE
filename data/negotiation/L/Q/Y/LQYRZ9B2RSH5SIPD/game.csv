"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially setting the price at $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $11,000 for the product?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $9,000, a midpoint between our last offers.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise here.",9000.0,Bob,4,
