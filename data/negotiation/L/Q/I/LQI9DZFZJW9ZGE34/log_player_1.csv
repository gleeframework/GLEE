""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth while offering you a chance to be the sole owner before I explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while anchoring Bob's perception of value at a higher level. 
* **Justification of value:** Highlighting the ""unique"" and ""valuable"" nature of the product helps justify the high asking price. 
* **Sense of urgency/scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other options"" implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act on this offer.
* **Backup option:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing Alice to confidently aim high with Bob. 

By offering the product at $1,500,000, Alice leaves room for negotiation while maximizing her potential profit."
