"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's find a middle ground - how about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be fair, $600,000 was a bit low, but I can't justify $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept that price.  Let's settle at $875,000 and close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell we both want to see this deal done. What if we split the difference and say $825,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",825000.0,Bob,6,
