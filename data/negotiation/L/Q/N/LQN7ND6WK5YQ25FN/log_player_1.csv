Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's find a middle ground - how about $950,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be fair, $600,000 was a bit low, but I can't justify $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell we both want to see this deal done. What if we split the difference and say $825,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?
