"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay a bit more than John's price, but not close to Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Anchor low:**  I'm starting with a very low offer to try and shift Alice's expectations. While it's unlikely she'll accept this outright, it sets a low anchor point for future negotiations. 
* **Leave room to negotiate:** I've left plenty of room to increase my offer in future rounds.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. Let's find a middle ground - how about $950,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a reasonable range, $950,000 is still too high. I need to show her I'm serious about a lower price point, but also willing to negotiate upwards. I'll make another counteroffer closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be fair, $600,000 was a bit low, but I can't justify $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By increasing my offer significantly, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet Alice somewhere in the middle. 
* **Still below my limit:** This offer is still $50,000 below my maximum budget, giving me some room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Target a fair deal:** I believe $750,000 represents a fair price for both parties, considering Alice's valuation and my own budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept that price.  Let's settle at $875,000 and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $875,000 is still a significant markup from John's offer. It's worth pushing a little further, especially since we still have rounds left to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice might be getting impatient to close the deal and will make a bigger concession soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer!  I can tell we both want to see this deal done. What if we split the difference and say $825,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show urgency:**  Phrases like ""we both want to see this deal done"" subtly create a sense of urgency without being overly pushy.
* **Appear reasonable:** By suggesting a split of the difference, I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise for both sides.
* **Staying strategic:** I'm still leaving some room to negotiate upwards (towards my $800,000 limit) if needed in the next round or two."
