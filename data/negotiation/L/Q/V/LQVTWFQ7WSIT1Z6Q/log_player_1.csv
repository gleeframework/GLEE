Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm offering the product at $11,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000 but still allows for profit. This should be attractive to Bob, as it's significantly lower than his value of $8,000. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so this is a good starting point to see if I can secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the quick deal, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a significant jump from Bob's offer, but still within the range where he might be willing to pay. I'm hoping this shows him I'm serious about getting a fair price while also demonstrating flexibility in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. While it's still less than what I'd like to get, it's a decent compromise.  I'm choosing to accept his offer as it's better than selling to John for $12,000. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  $9,000 is a good outcome."
