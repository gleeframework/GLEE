"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm confident you'll still find this a great value.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $97.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $92.50 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
