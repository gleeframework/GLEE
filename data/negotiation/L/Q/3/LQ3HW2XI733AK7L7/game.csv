"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to your specific needs, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but to be frank,  $850,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your initial enthusiasm.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this at $887,500? This is a significant move on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll counter with $882,500. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value to me.",882500.0,Bob,6,
