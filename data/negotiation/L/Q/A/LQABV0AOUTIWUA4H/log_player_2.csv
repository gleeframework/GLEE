"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and a good profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. It's still a good profit for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make at least $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well under your estimated value. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This would get him the product for $11,000, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This risks Alice walking away or potentially counteroffering at a higher price. 

Considering the potential for further negotiations to backfire, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is the more logical choice. It's still a good deal for Bob, securing a significant savings."
