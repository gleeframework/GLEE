Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a higher price than John's offer, but it gives me a chance to make more profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** By offering a higher price, I risk Bob rejecting the offer. However, if he accepts, I make a larger profit.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. A higher offer might be more appealing to him if he sees the product as worth more than $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always lower it slightly in a counteroffer.  

This strategy aims to balance the potential for higher profits with the risk of losing the sale to John."
