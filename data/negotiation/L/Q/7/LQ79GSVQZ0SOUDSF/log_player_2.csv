# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to compromise further. However, I'm willing to make a small adjustment to my previous offer.

While it's not the ideal price, Alice seems firm and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $12,800 avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to buy from John at $15,000."
