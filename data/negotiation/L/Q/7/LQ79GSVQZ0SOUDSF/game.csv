"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,1,
