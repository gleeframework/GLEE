Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible while staying above our minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's perceived value gives him the feeling of getting a potential deal and might leave room for negotiation upwards. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  A price closer to $15,000 shows we understand the product's worth to Bob, building trust while still aiming for a significant profit.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate down, but it sets us up for the highest potential profit."
