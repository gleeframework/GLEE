"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $925,000 is too high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. We have room to negotiate and time before John's offer becomes the more appealing option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to ensure this deal reflects the product's value.  How about we settle at $900,000?  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm serious and unlikely to go much lower. This increases the pressure on him to accept while still leaving a small margin for him to counter if he's absolutely unwilling to meet this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence in valuing the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $885,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers and we are getting close to my minimum.  It's better to accept a slightly lower offer now than risk him walking away or having to accept an even lower offer later."
