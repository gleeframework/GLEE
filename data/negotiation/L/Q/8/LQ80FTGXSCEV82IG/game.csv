"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential return on investment. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the product's value in the current market.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we are getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a mutually agreeable price. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,825,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a significant opportunity for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, and that's my final offer. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
