"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway by offering a price that's closer to her valuation. This shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Alice to accept.  $10,500 is a significant reduction from the initial offer and allows for potential further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her initial offer and is within Bob's budget.  While there's still room to negotiate down further, it's not worth risking a deal with Alice, especially since Jhon is selling for $12,000.  Accepting the offer guarantees a purchase at a good price."
