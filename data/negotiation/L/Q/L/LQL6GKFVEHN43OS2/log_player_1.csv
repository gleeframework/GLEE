"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's seriousness. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The product's value to you ($1,500,000) is your absolute floor, and Bob's valuation ($800,000) gives you insight into his potential ceiling. Aiming high initially helps you understand if a mutually beneficial deal is possible.
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's perspective, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counteroffer was expected, it's still too far from your target. You have room to negotiate and selling to John guarantees your minimum, so there's no need to settle hastily."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective on the price. I've looked more closely at the product's potential value in your hands, and I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of this asset."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've made a significant concession from your initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is still within a range that keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly shifts focus to the potential value the product holds for Bob, reinforcing its worth.
* **Firmness:**  While the tone remains collaborative, the offer is presented with a sense of firmness, suggesting you're confident in its fairness.

By gradually lowering your price while still remaining above your minimum, you're aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable for both parties without caving in too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a significant gap from what I can justify.  To be frank, anything above $1,200,000 is going to be a very tough sell for me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 mark. 
* **Negotiating Position:** You still have room to negotiate, and walking away now with a counteroffer still on the table doesn't make strategic sense. 
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of selling to John for your minimum, giving you leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Move:** You're making another substantial drop in price to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to move closer to your position. However, you are still keeping the offer significantly above his current offer and above your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes that this offer is tailored to Bob's ""specific needs,"" subtly reminding him of the unique value proposition he'd be getting.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is a ""significant compromise,"" you subtly introduce a sense of urgency, suggesting this might be your final significant concession. 

This counteroffer aims to:
   *  Entice Bob with a significantly lower price.
   *  Keep the negotiation moving without going below your acceptable range. 
   *  Signal that you're getting closer to your bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price is still a bit rich for me. I'd be willing to move up to $1,300,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Finish Line:**  While Bob's offer is now above your minimum, you still have rounds to spare and can try to negotiate a better price. 
* **Assessing Bob's Stance:** Bob has mentioned a ""limit,"" but it's unclear how firm that limit is. By continuing the negotiation, you can test his resolve.
* **John as a Safety Net:** You still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, giving you a strong fallback position. 

You'll reject this offer, but your next counteroffer should be carefully considered.  You need to determine how much more you're willing to concede to try and secure a deal with Bob above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. While your offer is appealing, I need to be mindful of the true value of this asset.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 â€“ this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** You're explicitly stating this is your ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and signal the end of concessions.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price of $1,450,000 is carefully positioned:
    * It's a substantial $150,000 above Bob's last offer, showing you're serious about maximizing your gain.
    * It leaves you with a $50,000 buffer above your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Justification:** You're reiterating the product's value without being overly aggressive, emphasizing fairness.

This approach aims to:
   *  Prompt Bob to make his final decision, hopefully accepting your offer.
   *  Maintain a strong position if he chooses to counter. 
   *  Ensure you still come out ahead if you walk away to John."
