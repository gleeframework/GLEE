Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. While your offer is appealing, I need to be mindful of the true value of this asset.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 â€“ this is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still very far from your maximum budget.  Her latest offer is a ""final offer"" indicating she's unlikely to move much more. It's time to cut your losses and go with your guaranteed option of John at $800,000."
