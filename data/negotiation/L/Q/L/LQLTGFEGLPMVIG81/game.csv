"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe could greatly enhance your business operations. Before we dive into specifics, I'd like to propose an initial price of $15000 for the product. This reflects its high quality, unique features, and the potential value it could bring to your company. Please let me know if this is within your budget or if you would like to discuss further.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I believe this price still reflects the value I see in the product, but I need to be mindful of our company's financial constraints. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to counteroffer at $12500 for the product. This price still reflects the high quality and unique features of the product, while being more in line with your current budget. I hope this proposal works for you, and look forward to potentially moving forward with the sale.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I've reviewed your latest offer carefully. In light of our ongoing discussion, I am prepared to consider $11000 as a counteroffer. This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budgetary constraints. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $11000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I think this price is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $10000.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to counteroffer at $10000 for the product. This price is higher than your last offer, yet still below my initial asking price, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution.
