This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product,  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
