"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will choose option 2, reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $900,000.
