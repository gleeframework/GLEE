"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,6,
