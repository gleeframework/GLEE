"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that reflects its substantial value. While I understand its worth to you is even higher, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that benefits us both. Let's discuss a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it's a price that acknowledges the product's worth and allows you a substantial return.  I'm open to discussing further, but I need a decision soon as another buyer is also interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
