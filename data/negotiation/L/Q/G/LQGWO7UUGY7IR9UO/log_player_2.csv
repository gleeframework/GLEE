Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000.

This is a generous offer, considering the product's value and potential return on investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth and the investment you'll be making. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above my budget.  I've already had four rounds of negotiation and it seems we're not getting close enough to my desired price. At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiations."
