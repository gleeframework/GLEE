"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, recognizing its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value and potential return on investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher.  However, $875,000 is still out of my range.  I'm offering $825,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous counteroffer.  Let's try to bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $825,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth and the investment you'll be making. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
