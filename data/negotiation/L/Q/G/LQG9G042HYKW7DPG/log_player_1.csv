Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum to the right buyer. I'm offering it to you at $950,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering its potential value."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $950,000 is a strong starting point:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * It's still attractive enough compared to John's guaranteed offer, incentivizing Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This approach seeks to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
