{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has gone back up to her original offer of $13,000. This suggests she's unlikely to budge further.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $15,000, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice. You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John."
