"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $12,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",12750.0,Alice,5,
