Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm starting with a price of $12,500. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his budget constraints,  $10,000 is too low for me. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly reduced offer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the product's quality and the value it brings.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
