Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not feasible. Let's try $1,200,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 just doesn't work for me. How about $1,000,000? This price still allows you a significant profit margin considering the value of the product for you. Let's find some common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $750,000 is still a long way from what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
