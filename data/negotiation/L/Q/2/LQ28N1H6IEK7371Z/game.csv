"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $900,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects the product's worth and allows us both to benefit.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the offer. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to the purchase if we can meet at this price.
