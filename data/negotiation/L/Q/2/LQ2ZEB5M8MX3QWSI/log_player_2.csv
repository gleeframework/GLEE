"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $1,500,000."
