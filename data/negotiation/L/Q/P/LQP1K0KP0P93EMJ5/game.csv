"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to miss. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your own value for it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product and offers you a significant advantage.  Let's reach an agreement in this round.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $1,075,000? This is a good midpoint between our last offers and gives us both some room to compromise. Let's aim for a deal this round.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,090,000. This is a fair offer that acknowledges your budget while still ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's close this deal in this round.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
