"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, you can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? It's a fair price that's still beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my desired price. At this point, I'm close enough to my budget ceiling that it's more worthwhile to just go with John and secure the product at $1,000,000. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better price from Alice, and the risk of getting stuck at a higher price is not worth it."
