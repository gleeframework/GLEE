"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to make this deal work.  Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I can't go lower than $12,500.  That's a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from this product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for understanding. How about we split the difference and meet at $12,125?  That's a fair compromise in my mind.",12125.0,Bob,6,
