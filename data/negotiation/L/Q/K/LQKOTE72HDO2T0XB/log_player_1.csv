Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I know you'll find it valuable, so I wanted to give you the first chance to purchase it before I offer it to others."",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since the product is worth $120 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price like $135 allows room for negotiation or a potential higher profit. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" and offering Bob the ""first chance"" might encourage him to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price. 
* **Backup plan:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't sell below your minimum price. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a bit of risk. Bob might reject the $135 offer, leading you to sell at $120 to John. However, the potential for a higher profit makes it a reasonable starting point in a negotiation."
