Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a good profit.  I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value.  While I could sell to him now, I'm not satisfied with that outcome.  I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum acceptable value.  This counteroffer should keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable value. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price will continue to drop, leading to a less favorable outcome.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."
