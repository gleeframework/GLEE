"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and would allow me to get a reasonable price for my product. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet at $1,080,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,080,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,120,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you. This would allow me to achieve a reasonable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,120,000. How about we meet at $1,060,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
