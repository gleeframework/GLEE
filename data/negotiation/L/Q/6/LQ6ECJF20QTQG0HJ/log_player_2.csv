I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice seems firm on her bottom line, and further haggling is unlikely to result in significant savings. Accepting the $1,012,500 offer is a reasonable compromise, allowing you to acquire the product while still saving a considerable amount compared to John's price."
