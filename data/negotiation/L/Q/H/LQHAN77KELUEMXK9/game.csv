"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $13,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $14,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering your offer of $14,000, I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $15,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a good compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
