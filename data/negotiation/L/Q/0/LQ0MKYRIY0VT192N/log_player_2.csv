"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, she's still significantly above our ideal price. We're closer to John's price, but it's worth seeing if we can negotiate Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? Would $7,000 work?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're getting close to the point where further haggling might not be worth it. We're only $800 away from John's price, and Alice seems to be making concessions in smaller increments. It's time to push a little harder or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair offer, but I have other options available to me. I'm willing to pay $7,100 for the product. That's my final offer. "",
""product_price"": 7100
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the end of our negotiation window. We need to signal that our time is valuable, and we have other options.  By stating our final offer, we put the ball in Alice's court. She can either accept the small concession or risk us walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,100. I'm willing to make one more offer: $7,300. It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly not budging from this price point.  We've been firm in our negotiations, and she's only willing to come down in very small increments. It's unlikely we'll get a better price than John's at this point.  It's time to cut our losses and move on to the guaranteed deal."
