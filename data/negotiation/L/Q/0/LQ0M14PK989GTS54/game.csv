"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 simply isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This would still leave you with a significant profit margin, while allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling we might not be able to find a deal here. I'm at my absolute limit and can't go lower than $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a good return on your investment. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
