"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum price of $800,000, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe that Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's significantly less than the value he places on the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer and reflects a willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to close the deal at this price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price point, but I'm starting to run out of time.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round.  If not, I'll likely have to consider selling to John."

{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $950,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm running out of time. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as it's closer to his last offer and still well above my minimum price. If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 920000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $920,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm running out of time and  want to avoid selling to John for $800,000. I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as it's closer to his last offer and still well above my minimum price. If he rejects this, I'll have to sell to John."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call.  While $880,000 is better than $800,000, it's still not ideal.  I've reached the final round, and I'm  not confident Bob will budge any further.  To avoid risking a total loss of the deal, I'll sell to John for $800,000."
