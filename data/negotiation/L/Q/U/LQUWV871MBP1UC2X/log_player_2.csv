"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7,500. It's a great price, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should propose a counteroffer lower than $7,500 to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500? I think that's a fair price."",

}
```

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $7,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but I believe there's still room to lower the price. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to $6,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $6,750?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 6750
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,750 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $7,000. While I might be able to push her down a bit more, it's getting risky. Accepting at $7,200 secures a decent discount without risking the deal entirely."
