Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing specific details, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Strategic positioning:** By offering the product to Bob at $1,400,000, you create a win-win situation if he accepts. You gain a significant profit above Bob's perceived value, and he gets the product for less than your guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
