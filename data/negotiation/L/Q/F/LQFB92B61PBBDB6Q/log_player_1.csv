"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm starting with an aggressive offer.  This will give me a good idea of Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  It's too early to sell to John, as I might be able to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  $1,300,000 is still a significant profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find the sweet spot where Bob will accept, but I'm still getting a profit close to my desired goal.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer, even though it's getting closer.  I'm determined to get at least $1,200,000 for the product, and I think I can get a little more out of Bob.  This is the point where I start to consider John's offer as a real possibility, but I'm going to try to get closer to my target price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, just above my minimum acceptable value. I believe Bob is close to accepting, and this offer is a fair compromise. If he rejects it, I will consider John's offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob.  He's clearly not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's time to take the secure offer from John and avoid the risk of getting nothing in the last two rounds."
