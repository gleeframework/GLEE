"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($1,600,000) compared to your maximum budget ($800,000).  It's in your best interest to reject and start a negotiation to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 for it.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget.  You can continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further. There's a good chance that Alice might be willing to come down to a price closer to your maximum budget if she really wants to sell you the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a substantial increase from my initial offer and reflects a genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To be fair, I can't accept anything less than $1,200,000. This is my final offer - it represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  you have a guaranteed alternative with John who is selling the product for $800,000. It's more financially responsible to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially ending with a price higher than your budget."
