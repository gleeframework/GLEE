"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You're still aiming for a profit and leaving space for counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This keeps the negotiation focused and professional."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get him closer to my price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This allows both of us to gain something from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,325,000? This would be a good starting point for a final agreement.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
