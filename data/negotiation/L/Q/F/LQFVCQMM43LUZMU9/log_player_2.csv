"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to lower the price.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but it's best to see if Bob can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's dropping the price by $100,000, which is a substantial amount. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and willing to negotiate.  It also positions Bob strategically for potential further negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This allows both of us to gain something from the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and with 7 rounds remaining, he can potentially get a better price. Buying from John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but Bob should aim to exhaust his negotiation options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,325,000? This would be a good starting point for a final agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but this time he's only reducing the price by $25,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to be reasonable and get closer to a deal, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  He's also reinforcing the idea that finding a price that works for both of them is the goal.  With 6 rounds remaining, Bob has time to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to meet my goals.  Let's seal this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,340,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer, and it's getting very close to Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better price is high.  It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that is still favorable to Bob.  While buying from John would be cheaper, it's important to consider that the relationship with Alice might be valuable for future transactions."
