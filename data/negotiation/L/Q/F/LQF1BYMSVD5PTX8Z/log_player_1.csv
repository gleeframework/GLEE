"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. I'm also aware of John's offer of $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product above $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,500.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's getting close to my minimum, but I still have rounds left and want to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. With limited rounds left, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting increasingly lower, and with only a few rounds left, I don't think there's enough time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. It's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
