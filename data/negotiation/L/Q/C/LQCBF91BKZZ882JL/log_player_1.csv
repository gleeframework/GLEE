Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. It's unlikely Bob would accept an offer above $12,000 knowing you have another buyer.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is polite, direct, and emphasizes value without explicitly mentioning your other offer.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible profit while leaving you with a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
