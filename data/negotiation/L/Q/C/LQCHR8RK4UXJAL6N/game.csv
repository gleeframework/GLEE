,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,000,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $1,000,000 is a great deal for me, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you almost halfway, though.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it demonstrates how committed I am to reaching an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",975000.0,Bob,6,
