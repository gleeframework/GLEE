"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,500 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal. To be honest, $10,000 is the very top of my budget.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
