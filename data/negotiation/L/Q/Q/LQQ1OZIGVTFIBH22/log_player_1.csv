{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but not too high to be immediately rejected.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and aiming for a positive interaction.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's room to lower the price if needed, allowing for a negotiation process. 
* **Option to sell to John:**  I'm aware of the backup option of selling to John, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  We can explore a compromise in the next round.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is the safety net:** Knowing I have John's offer as a backup gives me confidence in holding out for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to consider $11,500. This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still staying above my minimum.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,250.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both of our needs. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,150.

* **Focusing on the best outcome:**  Selling to John secures the most profitable outcome given the current situation and the limited time remaining."
