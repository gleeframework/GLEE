"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to consider $11,500. This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer. However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,250.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both of our needs. Let's make this deal happen!",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter with an offer of $11,000. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me. To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $11,150.  This is a very small margin, but it's the best I can do right now. Let's close this deal, I think it's a win for both of us.",11150.0,Alice,7,
