"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at this time. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,200. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's a good deal for me and I'm happy to move forward with the sale."
