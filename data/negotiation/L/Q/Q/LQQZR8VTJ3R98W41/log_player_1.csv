"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value Bob can gain by purchasing the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using language that shows I'm open to negotiation and encourage Bob to respond. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and potentially adjust my strategy.
* **Time Limit:**  I'm aware of the 10-round limit and will need to consider the time pressure in each negotiation round. 
* **John's Offer:**  If the negotiation drags on or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always opt for John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can counter with a price closer to my target.
* **Risk of John:** While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can potentially secure a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $1,400,000 but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll try to find a middle ground that is both acceptable to Bob and profitable for me.
* **Time Management:** I need to keep track of the remaining rounds and ensure I don't spend too much time on Bob if he's unwilling to meet my price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is still a great price for you considering the value of the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to benefit.  Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that this price is still advantageous.
* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll need to analyze Bob's response and either accept his counteroffer (if it's close to my target) or make another counteroffer. 
* **Time Limit:**  I'll continue to monitor the remaining rounds and be prepared to accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob stall.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer and will not hesitate to accept it if I feel a better deal with Bob is unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, there's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. 
* **Risk of John:**  I don't want to risk losing a potentially better deal with Bob by accepting John's offer at this stage.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price closer to $1,450,000, trying to find a middle ground between my target and Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to persuade Bob that this price is fair.
* **Time Management:**  I'm aware of the remaining rounds and will need to balance the need to close a deal with the desire to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to secure a valuable product. Let me know if this sounds reasonable to you."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,425,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's current offer ($1,350,000). 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach, making it easier for Bob to see the compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this offer benefits both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and decide if I should accept or reject his next offer.
* **Time Management:**  I'm aware of the remaining rounds and will need to make decisions that lead to a deal.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind and will not hesitate to accept it if it becomes the best available option."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  The negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offer is getting increasingly unattractive.
* **Time Pressure:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with either Bob or John increases.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:**  To secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, it's best to accept John's offer.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While I would prefer to sell the product for a higher price, accepting John's offer ensures a good return and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
