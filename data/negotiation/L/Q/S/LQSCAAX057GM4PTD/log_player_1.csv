Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights that this is a good deal for both of us, emphasizing the value I'm offering.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't shut down the negotiation, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy balances the need to get a good price with the potential of Bob counter-offering and reaching a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. It's a bit lower than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to make a compromise. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** While selling to John for $1,200,000 is an option, I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's a good chance he might be willing to go higher than $600,000. 

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a great deal for you considering what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $800,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's meet in the middle and close this deal"" creates a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to meet Bob halfway while maintaining a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
