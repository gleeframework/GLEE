"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. It's a bit lower than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to make a compromise. Can you meet me in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800000, which is still a great deal for you considering what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
