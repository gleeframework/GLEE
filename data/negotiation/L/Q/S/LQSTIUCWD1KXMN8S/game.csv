"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget, and I'd like to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider meeting me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500 was a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to compromise at $9,750. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,250. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,

I'm willing to meet you at $9,750 was too high, but I'm willing to compromise at $9,750 was too high, but I'm willing to compromise at $9,900. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to compromise further on the price, Bob. I've made significant concessions already, and I believe the product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to make one final offer of $10,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
