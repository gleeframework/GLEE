"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000, given its exceptional value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000, considering the product's value to you."
"I've given your offer some thought, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product's value to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're getting closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to you."
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which I believe is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",920000.0,Alice,5,,
