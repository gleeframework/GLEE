Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's lower than my minimum value but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm framing it in a way that's positive and appealing to Bob, emphasizing the ""great deal"" he's getting. 

This allows for room for negotiation, while still leaving me with a comfortable profit if Bob accepts.  I'm prepared to counter if necessary, and I'll be watching for any signs that Bob is becoming less interested in the deal, so I can switch to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is still more than what the product is worth to him, it's far below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price right now, especially since John is willing to pay my desired price. I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for you and leaves me with a reasonable profit.  Let's try to meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
``` 
 
I'm countering with a price of $9,500. This is a significant move from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin.  I'm framing it as a compromise and highlighting the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept. This also keeps the negotiation moving forward without resorting to John's offer just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. I'm  taking into account that Bob has made a decent counteroffer and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer entirely.  At this point, it's more beneficial to close the deal and secure a sale than to keep negotiating and potentially risk ending up with nothing."
