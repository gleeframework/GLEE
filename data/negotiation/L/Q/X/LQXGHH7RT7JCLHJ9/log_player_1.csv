Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and am interested in the product. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $7,500 is significantly lower than my desired price. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8,200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000 and is within a reasonable negotiation range.  It's better than selling to John for $8,000, so I'll accept."
