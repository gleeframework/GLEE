{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above his maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price or explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals Bob's seriousness about saving money and sets a lower starting point for negotiations.  It's possible Alice will reject this offer, but it's a good starting point to see where the negotiations go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He has limited rounds, and there's a chance he can get a better deal. He'll try to counteroffer again to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise. He's still aiming to stay below his maximum budget and hopes to find a middle ground with Alice. This is a calculated risk as Alice may reject again, but it keeps the negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget. Although he's running out of time, Bob is determined to get the best deal possible. There's still room for negotiation, and he's willing to risk one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering Alice's maximum price, but this is still a good deal for him. He's essentially offering the price he'd pay to John, so it's a win-win situation if Alice accepts. It's a risky move, as Alice might counter, but it's the final attempt to get the product at his desired price."
