Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so offering it above that is necessary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $9,500 offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially allowing Alice to still get a better price than John's offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will pay $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out."
