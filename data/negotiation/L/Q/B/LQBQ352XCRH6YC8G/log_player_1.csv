Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the maximum amount I am comfortable spending on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is steadily decreasing his offers in smaller increments. While he might still go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll meet my minimum of $1,200,000.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds that may not yield a significantly better outcome."
