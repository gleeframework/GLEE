Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can get you to come down a bit. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob that it's worth the price you're asking. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" you're showing Bob that you're open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving a good chance of securing the sale with Bob."
