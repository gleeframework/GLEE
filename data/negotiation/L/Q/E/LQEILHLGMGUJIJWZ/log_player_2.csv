"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still a significant amount above your ideal price.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to work with, so it's worth exploring lower prices with Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have the option of buying from John, but it's not your ideal choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is very interesting, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, $900,000 is still more than you'd like to pay.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You have 7 rounds remaining, and you can continue to push for a lower price. 
* **John remains a backup option.** Buying from John is still a possibility if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it shows my serious interest in purchasing this product. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $885,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.**  $885,000 is only $35,000 above your desired price of $850,000.
* **You have limited rounds left.** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's risky to keep negotiating, especially as Alice has indicated this is her final offer. 
* **John is a backup, but not ideal.** Buying from John would cost you significantly more.

**While you could try to negotiate a bit lower, accepting this offer is likely the best course of action to secure the product at a reasonable price.**"
