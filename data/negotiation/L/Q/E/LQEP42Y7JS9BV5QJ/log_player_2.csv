"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is too high. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so there's room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice is willing to come down to a price closer to your budget."
