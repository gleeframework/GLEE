Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'll adjust based on Bob's response. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation, and it's significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, making it tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is too low for me.  While it's better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
