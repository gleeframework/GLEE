"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's $150, there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, and rejecting Alice's offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal compared to John's $150.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and it's likely Alice won't budge much more.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a decent price, and saves you time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
