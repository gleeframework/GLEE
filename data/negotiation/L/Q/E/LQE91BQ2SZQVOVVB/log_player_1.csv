I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good compromise - it's more than my minimum of $80, but still leaves Bob with a good profit margin of $20.  

This approach maximizes my potential earnings. If Bob accepts, I make $20 more than selling to John. If Bob rejects, I'm guaranteed $80 from John anyway."
