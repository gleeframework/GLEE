"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Your goal is to buy for less than $800,000.
* **You have better options.** You can either counteroffer Alice or buy from John for $800,000.  

It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and hopefully we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's better than her first offer, it's still above your target of $800,000.
* **You have a better option.** You can still buy from John for $800,000. 

It makes sense to reject and counteroffer again to see if you can get closer to your desired price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable at $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 825000}
