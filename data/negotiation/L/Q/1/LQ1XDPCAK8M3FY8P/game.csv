,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and hopefully we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know if you're interested.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable at $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
