"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and hopefully we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $750,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the product's value. This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable at $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $825,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
