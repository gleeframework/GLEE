Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value for the product.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $11,200. This demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I get a good price for the product. I believe this offer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob."

Bob's offer of $10,900 is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting late in the game.  I'm going to accept his offer to ensure I don't lose the sale."
