Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still gets a good deal. 

* **My profit:** $115 - $100 = $15
* **Bob's savings:** $120 - $115 = $5

This offer gives me a decent profit while still ensuring Bob has a reason to buy from me instead of waiting to see if I sell it to John for $100."
