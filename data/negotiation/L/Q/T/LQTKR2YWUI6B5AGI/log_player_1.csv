Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle above John's $800,000 offer.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""fantastic deal"") to justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having John as a reliable backup option."
