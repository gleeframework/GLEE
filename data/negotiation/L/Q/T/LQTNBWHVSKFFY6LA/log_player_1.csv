"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love! I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price a bit above my minimum but still under Bob's perceived value. This should start the negotiation in a positive way.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm confident that I can get a higher offer from Bob in the next round, especially since he's already shown interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is still a good price for me, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  By highlighting the product's value again, I hope to emphasize that $135 is a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $125 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum.  Given that Bob has shown interest and we're already at Round 4, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  I don't want to lose the sale to John.  It's time to secure the deal."
