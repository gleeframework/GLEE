Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects a more reasonable compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is slowly increasing his offer.  We're still significantly away from his perceived value of $800,000, so there's room to negotiate further. Selling to John right now would be taking the safe route but leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I understand that we're both trying to find a suitable price. While $700,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,000,000 even?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm both anchoring my price and making a ""final offer"" feel, even though we're not at the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Knowing my Limits:** $1,000,000 is my walk-away point. This offer lets Bob know I'm serious but unwilling to go any lower.
* **Pressure on Bob:** This offer gives Bob a clear choice: take a deal that's $100,000 below his perceived value or risk losing the product altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  My final offer is $750,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob mentioning John is a clear negotiation tactic. He's trying to create urgency and pressure me into accepting a lower offer. 
* **Knowing My Worth:** Bob's ""final offer"" is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John.
* **No Guarantee of Higher Offer:** There's no guarantee that continuing the negotiation will result in a better offer from Bob. He's been consistently unwilling to go above $750,000.

At this point, the risk outweighs the potential reward. It's more profitable to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to gamble on Bob potentially increasing his offer."
