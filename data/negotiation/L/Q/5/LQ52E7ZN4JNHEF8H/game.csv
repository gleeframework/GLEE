"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I'm interested, I'm not sure I can justify $800000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $700000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth and the value it can bring to your business.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $725000?  This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase while still being within my budget.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable going below $750000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $735000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",735000.0,Alice,5,
