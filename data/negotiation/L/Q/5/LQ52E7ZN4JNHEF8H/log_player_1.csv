I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  While I'm interested, I'm not sure I can justify $800000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $700000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $725000?  This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase while still being within my budget.
