# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's important to start low to leave room for negotiation. This price also gives Alice a chance to still make a profit while getting closer to your ideal price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still above your maximum price and John's offer. It's worth negotiating further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000?  It's a fair price that considers the value of the product while working within my budget."",

}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It's a significant jump from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still leaving room for negotiation before reaching John's offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is very close to your maximum price, but you are even closer to John's offer.  There's still a chance to save a bit more money before resorting to John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to offer you $12,100 for the product. This is a competitive offer and reflects my strong interest in making this deal work."",
""product_price"": 12100
}
```

Here's the strategy with this counteroffer:

* **Staying Competitive:** This offer is just above John's price, showing Alice you're serious about buying from her if the price is right.
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message emphasizes that this is a competitive offer and that you're invested in closing the deal with Alice.
* **Final Push:**  This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court and encourages her to make a final decision."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we split the difference and meet at $12,350? This way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge below $12,350. While you could try to haggle further, you're running out of rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $12,000."
