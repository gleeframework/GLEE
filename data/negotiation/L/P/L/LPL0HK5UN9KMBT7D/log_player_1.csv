Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would get from other buyers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's above Bob's value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the potential for a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The mention of other buyers subtly reminds Bob that there are other options, adding pressure.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:

* **Negotiate Down:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll likely counter back, aiming to get a price closer to $12,000.
* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale and earned a decent profit.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob keeps rejecting and we reach an impasse, I'll switch to John to secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's counteroffer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product. This means there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between my starting price and Bob's offer. I'll likely offer something closer to $10,000 or $11,000, depending on how confident I feel about reaching a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my initial $12,000 offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $11,000 is closer to Bob's offer, but still above his proposed price, creating room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price is still considerably higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum value, ensuring a reasonable profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts this offer, I'll have successfully negotiated a price that's good for both of us.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects again, I'll need to carefully assess his willingness to negotiate.  I may choose to come down a bit more or, if he seems inflexible,  move to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider $10500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise, bridging the gap between our previous offers. 
* **Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob's interest, and potentially end up with a lower offer or no deal at all.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer,  secure a sale, and move on to potentially other opportunities."
