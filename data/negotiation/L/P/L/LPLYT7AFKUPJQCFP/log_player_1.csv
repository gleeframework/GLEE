"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. My counteroffer is $1,275,000. I believe this price reflects the value you've acknowledged and gives us a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
