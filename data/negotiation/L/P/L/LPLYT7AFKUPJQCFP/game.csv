"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a fair deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. My counteroffer is $1,275,000. I believe this price reflects the value you've acknowledged and gives us a mutually beneficial deal.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
