"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. My counteroffer is $1,275,000. I believe this price reflects the value you've acknowledged and gives us a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is only $75,000 more than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, potentially leading to a higher price or a dead end.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price within his budget."
