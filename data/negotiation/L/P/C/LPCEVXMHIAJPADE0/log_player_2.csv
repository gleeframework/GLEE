"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want to save as much money as possible. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in making a deal and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is closer to my target price but still a bit too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. How about $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I still want to save some money. I'm hopeful that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still above her minimum price and allows for a profitable sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is just slightly above my target price of $10,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price reduction, which might not be worth the time and effort. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
