"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $13,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $13,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $10,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hopeful that we can close a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make at least $12,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to go lower than $12,000.  Bob has already made significant concessions and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price within his budget.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John for $8,000."
