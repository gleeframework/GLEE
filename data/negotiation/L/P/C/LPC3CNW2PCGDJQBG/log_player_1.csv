Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer it to you for $1,550,000.
