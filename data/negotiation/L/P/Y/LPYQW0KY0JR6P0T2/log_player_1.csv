"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $130, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer and for us to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Staying Above my Minimum:** $130 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is more than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and amicable. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and suggesting that $120 is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise, hoping to reach an agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Although I'm nearing my minimum, I believe there's still room for a small compromise from Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have the option to sell to John for $150, which is more than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $115? This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. This creates urgency and might push Bob to accept. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm reminding Bob that I have other options.  This adds pressure to reach a deal.
* **Negotiation Limit:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I may have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No significant room for negotiation:** At this point, Bob's offers are very close to my minimum.  There's not much room for further negotiation. 
* **John's offer is better:**  Selling to John for $150 is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer. It's also likely that Bob won't budge significantly from his current offer.

**Therefore, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $150.**"
