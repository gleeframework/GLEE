"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're really interested, and I value that. $7,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $7,500? It's a fair price for both of us.

Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're only $500 apart now. It's worth one more try to see if we can get a slightly better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $7,250 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $7,375? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375

Alice is very unlikely to go below this price, and it's a good deal compared to John's offer.  Taking the offer now avoids the risk of the price going up or missing out entirely."
