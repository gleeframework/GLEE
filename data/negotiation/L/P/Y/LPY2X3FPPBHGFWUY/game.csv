"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really interested, and I value that. $7,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet halfway. How about $7,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $7,500 is close, but could you do $7,250? That would really seal the deal for me.",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $7,250 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $7,375? It's a fair price for both of us.",7375.0,Alice,7,
