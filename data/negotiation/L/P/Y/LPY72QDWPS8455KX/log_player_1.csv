Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is $1,000 above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like it's a good opportunity.
* **Confidence:**  Stating that it's a great deal and worth the price helps solidify my position and avoids appearing desperate.

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Could you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **John is a safe alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, I'm not comfortable going that low at this stage. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price by $500. This demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price. This helps me maintain a strong position.
* **Finding common ground:** I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and avoiding a stalemate with Bob. I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm not giving up on getting closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $12,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. Could you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:**  While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and limits the potential for further negotiations to fail. 

Since I'm close to my minimum and there's a risk of losing Bob, it's safer to accept his offer and secure the sale."
