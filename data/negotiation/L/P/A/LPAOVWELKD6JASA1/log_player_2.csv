"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $140 is cheaper than buying from John for $150. 
* Even though Alice's price is higher than the product's value to her ($100), it's still within your budget of $150 and saves you money compared to John's offer."
