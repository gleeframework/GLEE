Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  It's more than the $1,000,000 you absolutely need.
* **Below Bob's max:**  It's less than the $1,200,000 Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable:** A $50,000 difference is a good starting point for haggling. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my initial proposal. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, hoping to find a compromise that still gets me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more to $1,125,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate. This price should hopefully be appealing enough for Bob to reconsider his counteroffer and we can potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,120,000 is very close to my last counteroffer. While I'd ideally like to get even closer to my original asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and ensures a sale."
