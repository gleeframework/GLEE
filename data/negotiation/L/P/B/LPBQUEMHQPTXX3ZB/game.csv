"Alice, that's a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  I understand the product's value, but I'd need to be at that price to make this worthwhile for me.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $875000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $837500? This would give us both a good deal and I can move forward with the purchase. ",837500.0,Bob,4,
