"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,300,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer and my minimum price. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive with his offers, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  I hope Bob will finally accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob keeps offering increasingly lower prices. I've already rejected his offer below my minimum price twice, and I don't want to risk him continuing to lower his offer further.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get a fair price."
