"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $1,600,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

We're still significantly below my minimum, but there's room to negotiate upwards. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further to reach a deal. How about $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000 makes the most sense at this point. It exceeds my minimum by $125,000 and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard. It's a good compromise and a profitable deal."
