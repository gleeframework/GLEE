"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider this price?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $140 is a bit too low for me, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $155 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $145. Can you consider this price?",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I can go down to $150, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $150. I'm willing to go up to $142, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",142.0,Bob,6,
