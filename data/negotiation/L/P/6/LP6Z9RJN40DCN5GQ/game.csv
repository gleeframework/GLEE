"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7500 is simply too low for me. How about $8500? This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7250. Can you consider that?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7250 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to sell the product without having to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $7750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",7750.0,Bob,6,
