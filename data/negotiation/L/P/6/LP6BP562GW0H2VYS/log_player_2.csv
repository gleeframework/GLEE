"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $110 is too high, as Bob values the product at $120.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $5 less than Alice's initial offer, which is a significant discount. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price.  $105 is still above what the product is worth to Alice, but it's within Bob's budget and allows room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $110 to $108. This is a good compromise, as it's still within Bob's budget and only $3 more than what Alice values the product at.  It's unlikely Bob can get a much lower price, and buying from John would cost him $12.  It's time to close the deal!"
