"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe I can't afford $14,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While $12,000 is a bit out of my budget, I am willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. Could we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. It's a $1,000 profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further drawn-out negotiations."
