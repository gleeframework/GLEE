"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $100 is still too high, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $85 is a good starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum price of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring Bob gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $92 for you, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  There are still several rounds left, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $92 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88?"", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiation strategy. He's aiming to meet Alice in the middle but is still working to get a price that's closer to his ideal range. $88 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal without being unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still several rounds remaining. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and gives Bob a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $90 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $89. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but he's still aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $89 shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best possible deal. This counteroffer is close to Alice's offer, making it likely that she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $91, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $91 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a slight chance of getting a better deal.  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still a few rounds left.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer keeps the door open for a lower price, as there's always a chance Alice will concede.  However, if Alice rejects the next counteroffer, Bob should seriously consider buying from John to avoid wasting more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum price, but $91 is still a little high for me. How about we settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistent in his negotiation. He's shown Alice that he's willing to compromise and meet her halfway, but he's also shown that he's not willing to overpay. This counteroffer is a fair price, allowing Alice to make a profit and Bob to get the product at a price he's comfortable with. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob should seriously consider buying from John in the next round as he's unlikely to get a better deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already said I'd sell it to you for $91, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at $91, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical juncture in the negotiation. While Bob has managed to get the price down, Alice has made it clear that she's unwilling to budge further.  With only one round left, the chance of getting a better deal from Alice is slim.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $120. While it's not the ideal price, it's still within Bob's budget, and he's guaranteed to get the product.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting the last round without achieving a better result."
