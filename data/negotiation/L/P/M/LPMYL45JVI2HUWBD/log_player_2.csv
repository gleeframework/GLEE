"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's $15,000 price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for your product.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  It's still a profitable deal for Alice, as she values the product at $8,000. 
* **Budget:**  $10,000 is well within Bob's $15,000 budget, leaving him room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my initial price. How about $11000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me the profit I need. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's concession:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, dropping from $12,000 to $11,000.
* **Good deal:** $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $4,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could potentially push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice could counter-offer again, potentially making the final price closer to $12,000.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of a worse deal and saves time."
