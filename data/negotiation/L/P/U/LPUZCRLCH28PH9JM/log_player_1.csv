I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $115. While I'd prefer a higher price, this is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $100.  It's also getting closer to my desired price point with only 6 rounds left."
