"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better deal. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation with Alice."
