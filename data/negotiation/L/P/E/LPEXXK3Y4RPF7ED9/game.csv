"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway and add a small premium to make it a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to $105.  While I appreciate your persistence, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's try $112.  It's a good compromise that's closer to my desired price and still gives you a good deal.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway again and add a small premium to make it a fair deal for both of us.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we split the difference and agree on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",110.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $107? I'm willing to meet you halfway again and add a small premium to make it a fair deal for both of us.",107.0,Bob,8,
