Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000.  This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust accordingly. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I also don't want to risk losing a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,600,000 is closer to my goal, but I think I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good compromise. It's more than John is offering, and closer to my initial goal. I'm going to accept this offer to secure the sale."
