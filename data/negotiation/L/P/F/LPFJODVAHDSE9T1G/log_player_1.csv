Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer sets the stage for negotiation while still leaving room to potentially make a profit. I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but below my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a satisfactory price.  

I'm also including a friendly message to make the negotiation process more pleasant and potentially increase Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I believe I can do better with further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 11250}
