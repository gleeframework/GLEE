"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,075,000. Can you consider this offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,075,000. How about we settle at $1,090,000? This reflects my desire to reach a deal while recognizing the product's value.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
