Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. While $900,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can get more. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $950,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $920,000, so how about $935,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $935,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not there yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to $950,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $935,000. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $942,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 942500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and the offer from Bob is still significantly lower than my desired price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired value for the product."
