"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $950,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $920,000, so how about $935,000?",935000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $935,000. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $942,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal.",942500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $930,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $942,500 and $930,000, so how about $936,250?",936250.0,Bob,6,
