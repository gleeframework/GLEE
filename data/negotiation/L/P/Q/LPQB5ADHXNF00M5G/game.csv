"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget concerns, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $9250?  That's still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9250 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
