"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can try to negotiate a better price from Alice since her offer is quite close to her valuation.  There's a good chance she might be willing to go a bit lower."

}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to establish a lower price point while still demonstrating interest. By starting significantly lower, we allow room for further negotiation while aiming for a price that saves us a substantial amount."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

Alice is budging, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can get her closer to $700,000."

This counteroffer aims for a price that's a good balance for both parties. It shows we're willing to move closer to her price while still striving for significant savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $715,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice will walk away. Accepting at $715,000 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at full price."
