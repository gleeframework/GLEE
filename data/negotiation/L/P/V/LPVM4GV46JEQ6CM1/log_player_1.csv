Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation if he's highly interested.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to encourage Bob to consider a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. In a real negotiation, there would be back-and-forth communication to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
