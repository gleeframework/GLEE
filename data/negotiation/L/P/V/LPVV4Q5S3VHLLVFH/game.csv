"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount for you, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
