"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price of $1,000,000. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're excited about the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $1,000,000.  I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth trying to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than my maximum price of $1,000,000.  Since I have the option to buy the product from John at my target price, it makes sense to do so rather than continue negotiating with Alice. I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down any further."
