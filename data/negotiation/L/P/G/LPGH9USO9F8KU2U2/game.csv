"I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"It seems like we're still quite far apart on price, Alice.  I can go up to $10,000, but that's my limit. It's a fair offer considering I can buy it from someone else for $12,000.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $14,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
