"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product,  $500000 is significantly lower than my initial assessment.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This price reflects the potential I see in this product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
