"I'm really interested in the product, but $17,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This would allow me to still make a decent profit and hopefully make this deal work for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",14250.0,Alice,5,
