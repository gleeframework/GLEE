"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However,  $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too much for me. How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $9,200 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Could you consider coming down to $8,900?  I believe that would be a fair price for both of us.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200, Bob. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and a personalized setup service. This way, you'll get even more value for your money. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,7,
