Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit. This also communicates that I am confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's find a compromise that works."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This is my final offer, as it aligns with the product's true value. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, as I mentioned earlier. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price.  We're at a stalemate, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations. Rather than continuing to haggle, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. This ensures I get a guaranteed profit and avoids any further risk of not closing the deal at all."
