Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than our fallback option ($800,000).
* **Confident but not Greedy:**  The message aims to convey the product's value while still leaving Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal."
