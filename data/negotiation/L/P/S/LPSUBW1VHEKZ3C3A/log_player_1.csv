Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to negotiate down.
* **Close to John's Offer:** While we know John will pay $150, we don't want to push Bob too close to that price right away. Offering $140 leaves a chance for Bob to counter-offer, while still securing a profit significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and a ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
