"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This is a gamble, as Alice might reject this offer, but it establishes a strong starting point for the negotiation. If she rejects, I'm prepared to adjust my counteroffer in subsequent rounds to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my ideal price, but I'm still hesitant to buy from John because I believe there's room to negotiate with Alice. I'll continue to explore potential price reductions in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below my ideal price. I'm hoping this signals my willingness to negotiate while also making it clear I'm not willing to pay Alice's asking price. This approach could potentially lead to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still above my desired price point. With 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating with Alice. There's no guarantee that she will lower her price enough to satisfy me, and I risk running out of time. Buying from John guarantees the product at a price I'm comfortable with, saving me time and potential further negotiations."
