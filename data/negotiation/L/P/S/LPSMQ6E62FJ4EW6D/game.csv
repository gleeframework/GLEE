"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Let's try $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle at $875000.  It's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not sure $875000 is enough for the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you at $885000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
