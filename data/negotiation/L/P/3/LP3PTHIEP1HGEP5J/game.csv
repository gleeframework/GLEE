"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you too. Let's start with a fair price. How about we aim for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $140, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",140.0,Bob,10,
