"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a strong starting point and allows for room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's important to remember that I have a floor price of $800,000, so I'm not willing to go lower than that.  I'll evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my floor price, I still believe I can get more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but still be mindful of my floor price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering my floor price and Bob's apparent interest in the product.  I'm optimistic that this counteroffer will be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my floor price, I'm still not satisfied with the price and I think I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll continue the negotiation in the hopes of getting a better price.  With only 6 rounds left, I need to start considering the risk of running out of time and being forced to sell to John at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant move from my previous counteroffer and shows that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this demonstrates my flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired outcome. With limited rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between being firm on my price and reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, we're running out of time, and I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also starting to consider the risk of selling to John at a lower price if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $890,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, acknowledging that time is running out. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to close the deal, while still getting a price that's closer to my desired outcome. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at $800,000, as I'm running out of time and the risk of getting a worse price is increasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a better price. Bob's offer of $885,000 is close to my floor price of $800,000, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure I don't risk selling to John at a lower price."
