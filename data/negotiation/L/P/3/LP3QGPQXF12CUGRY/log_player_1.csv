Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't dictate our starting point. We want to maximize our potential profit.
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a higher price ($19,000) sets an ""anchor"". Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal. We can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Backup Plan:** We have a safety net. If Bob rejects our offer, we can sell to John for our minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we don't have additional information about Bob's negotiation style or how urgently he needs the product."
