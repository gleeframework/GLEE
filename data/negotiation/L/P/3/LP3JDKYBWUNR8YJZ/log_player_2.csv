(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth more to Alice than to me, so I should try to negotiate a lower price. $150 is far more than my limit, and I can get it from John for $80, so I'll reject and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to start with my maximum price, as I know that's what I'd be willing to pay if I had to. It's likely Alice will reject this, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's come down. I'll reject and continue to negotiate. I can still get it from John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping it below my maximum. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my limit, and I know I can get it from John for $80. I'll keep negotiating with Alice, as there's still some room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still keeping it below $100. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and I want to see if we can reach a deal."
