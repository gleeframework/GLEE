"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for my full asking price. I'm confident in the value of the product, and Bob knows it's worth at least $1,000,000 to him.  If he rejects, I'll have room to negotiate. I also have the security of John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 unless I absolutely have to.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push him closer to my desired price. While selling to John is tempting, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'm confident I can get a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise that Bob might accept. I'm still holding out for a better price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are ticking by."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob still hasn't met my minimum price. I'm not confident I can get him to budge any further, and I'm running out of time. It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer, even if it's not my ideal price."
