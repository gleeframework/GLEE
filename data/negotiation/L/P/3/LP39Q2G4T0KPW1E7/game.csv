"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to get a good price and you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go at this point. Can you meet me there?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1,350,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $1,380,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,365,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1365000.0,Bob,4,
