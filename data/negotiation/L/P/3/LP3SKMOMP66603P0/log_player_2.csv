"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $100. That's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $100 is higher than your maximum budget of $80. 
* You know John will sell you the product for $80.

It makes the most sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to get the best price."
