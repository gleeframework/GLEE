Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $700,000 is a fair offer, but I need to see a bit more to make this work for me.

I'm running out of rounds and Bob's offer is still below my desired price.  It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000 than to risk getting a lower price or no deal at all with Bob."
