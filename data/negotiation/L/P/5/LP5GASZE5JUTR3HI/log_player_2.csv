{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's important to keep pushing for a lower price, as I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on and gives me another chance to make a counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time by a smaller amount.  I'm trying to find a compromise between my maximum budget and what Alice seems willing to accept.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Alice to consider, but still leaves me room to negotiate further if necessary."
