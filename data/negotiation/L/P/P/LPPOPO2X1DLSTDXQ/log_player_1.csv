"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if we reach a compromise.
* **Optimistic but Realistic:**  I'm setting a price that I believe is achievable within the 10 rounds, but I'm also prepared to walk away and get my minimum acceptable price from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, indicating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Maintaining Ground:** While I'm making a concession, I'm not giving away too much. The price is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired range. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm expressing optimism and suggesting we can reach a mutually agreeable deal, fostering a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000 for your product. This is higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Since we're already in round 4, I'm confident that I can't get much more from Bob, and it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a very favorable price, especially considering John's offer is only $50,000 more."
