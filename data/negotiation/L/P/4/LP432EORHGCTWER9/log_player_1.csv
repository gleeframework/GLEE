Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. If he rejects, I'm ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a good deal.  This shows Bob I'm flexible but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $87 is a decent compromise.  It's significantly better than selling to John and only a small distance from my goal. I'll accept Bob's offer."
