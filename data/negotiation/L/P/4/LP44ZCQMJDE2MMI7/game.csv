"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is too low. Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is close, but to make this work for me, I'd need it to be at least $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
