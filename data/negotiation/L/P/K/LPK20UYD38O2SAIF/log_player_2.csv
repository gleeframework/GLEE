Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not going to jump at $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if she's willing to come down."

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not ready to accept. It's time to make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

I'm going to offer $9,250, which is a small increase from my last offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to meet her halfway, but I still want to save as much money as possible."

This is a good deal. Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and I'm only paying $200 more than what I'm willing to pay from John. It's time to close the deal!"
