"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You know the product is worth $12,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,800? This is still a great deal, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you can still try to negotiate a bit further.  You're only $800 away from your limit, so it's worth seeing if you can get her down a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this happen.  $10,600 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,700? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice's offer is $10,700, which is only $700 more than your limit.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth and may not result in a better price. It's better to accept her offer and secure the product, especially since you're fairly close to your limit."
