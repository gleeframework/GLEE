"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, and I'm proposing $1,400,000. Let's meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $950,000? I'm serious about buying this product and I think this is a fair price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the highest price I'm willing to pay. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer of $1,000,000, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer my product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
