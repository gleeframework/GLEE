It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer. Here's why:

* **Reached your limit:** You've already offered your maximum price of $1,000,000.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice has consistently rejected your offers and is trying to push for a higher price even when you presented your final offer. 
* **John is the safer option:** Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the price you deem acceptable without further risk of the negotiation failing."
