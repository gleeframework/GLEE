"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me keep the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,800 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession, how about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to go with my other buyer. What's your final decision?",9250.0,Alice,5,
