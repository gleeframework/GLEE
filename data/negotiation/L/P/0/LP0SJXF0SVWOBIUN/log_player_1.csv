{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $10,000 to you, so this price gives you a profit.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000, so this price is likely within his acceptable range.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left some space for Bob to counteroffer without you needing to immediately drop to his price. 

Let me know what Bob's response is and we can strategize further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price.  You can do better! 

It's important to remember that you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum. This gives you leverage. Let's see if we can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me keep the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate and be flexible.
* **Still above your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  If Bob is still hesitant, you can potentially make a small concession in the next round. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to get as close to my budget as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You are better off selling to John for $10,000 than accepting this offer. 

It's important to remember that you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum. This gives you leverage.  We'll see if we can find a price that works for both of you in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,800 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession, how about $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us. If you're still not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to go with my other buyer. What's your final decision?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a clear sign of your final stance:**  You're signaling that you're not willing to go any lower.
* **Leaves a small amount of wiggle room:** Bob might be willing to come up just a bit to finalize the deal. 
* **Highlights the risk of losing the deal:**  You're reminding Bob that he might lose the product if he doesn't accept.

Let's see if this is enough to convince Bob to close the deal!"
