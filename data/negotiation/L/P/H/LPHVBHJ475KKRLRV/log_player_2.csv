Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still a significant markup from the value Alice places on the product. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than the value she places on the product. This gives Alice room to negotiate while also potentially securing a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While closer to your acceptable price, it's still worth seeing if you can get it lower. You have several rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from your previous offer. It's still a significant saving for you while likely appealing to Alice as she moves closer to her desired price. It's important to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, it's still not a good deal.  There are still a few rounds left to negotiate, and you can likely get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've been steadily increasing your offer, showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product.  This counteroffer is a small step up from your previous offer, but it's still a significant saving compared to Alice's last offer. This might be enough to convince her to close the deal before you reach your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have a few rounds left and can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, you're close to your maximum price, but Alice is also showing a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer and only $10 away from your maximum. There's a good chance Alice will accept, but if she rejects, you may have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $147.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to your maximum price, but you only have one round left. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price in the remaining time. Buying from John for $150 is a slightly higher price, but it guarantees you'll get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice."
