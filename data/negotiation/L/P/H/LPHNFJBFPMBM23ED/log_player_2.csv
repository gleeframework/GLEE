{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your price, but it's still not quite there.  You've already spent a few rounds negotiating, and you're running out of time.  It's probably better to buy from John at this point. It's still within your budget, and you don't want to risk losing the product completely."
