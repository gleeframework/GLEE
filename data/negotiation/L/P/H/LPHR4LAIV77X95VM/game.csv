"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However, $18,000 is higher than I'm able to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. It's my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
