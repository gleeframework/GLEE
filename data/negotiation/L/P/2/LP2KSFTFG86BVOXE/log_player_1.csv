Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation.  It's also important to note that I'm not giving Bob a ""take it or leave it"" offer. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise from my original offer, but still above Bob's offer and above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about a deal but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
