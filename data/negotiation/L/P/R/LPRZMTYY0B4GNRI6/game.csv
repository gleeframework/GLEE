"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I do see the value in the product, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,750. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,250. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",8250.0,Alice,5,
