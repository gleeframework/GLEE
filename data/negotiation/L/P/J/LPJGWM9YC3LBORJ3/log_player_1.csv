"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm also trying to build some rapport by emphasizing the product's value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you do any better than that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm still above my minimum acceptable value but am showing flexibility by coming down a bit from my initial offer. I'm also framing it as a compromise and reminding Bob of his interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not under too much pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm framing it as a fair solution for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go up to $110. How about $107.50? That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, we're still too far apart, and we only have a few rounds left.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $150 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
