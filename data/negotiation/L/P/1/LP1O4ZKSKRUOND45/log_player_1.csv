"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for concessions and creates the perception of the product's high value.
* **Anchoring:** The initial offer acts as an anchor. By starting at $1,300,000, we aim to influence Bob's perception of the product's value and steer subsequent offers closer to our desired range.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is essential in negotiations. 

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's interest while leaving space for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. We have room to negotiate and time is on our side as we have the guaranteed option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe we might be undervaluing its long-term potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We made a substantial concession of $150,000 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""long-term potential"" to subtly reiterate the product's value and justify the higher price point.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""middle ground"" and ""fair compromise"" fosters a collaborative negotiation environment.

We're still aiming high, but this counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to assess Bob's flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we could potentially negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a profitable deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
