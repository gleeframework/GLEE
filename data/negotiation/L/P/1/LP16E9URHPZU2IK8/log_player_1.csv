Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $925,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still secure a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
