Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer, along with the message:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** Alice has a strong BATNA because she knows John will buy the product for $1,500,000. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so any price above that would be a loss for him.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential ZOPA between $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) and $1,500,000 (Alice's minimum).

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for negotiation to entice Bob while ensuring she gets a price closer to her minimum. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, giving Alice room to negotiate while staying well above her $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without directly revealing Alice's bottom line.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" encourages Bob to engage in negotiation rather than outright rejecting the offer."
