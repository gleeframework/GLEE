"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $100. This allows room for negotiation and gives me the best potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion, allowing him to express interest and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. While I can technically accept it, I want to see if I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $100, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob in hopes of a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still leaves me a decent margin, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, emphasizing the product's value and highlighting my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and hopefully lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would mean a loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Even though we're nearing the middle, I'm not ready to give up. I believe there's still room for Bob to come up in his offer.
* **Sell to John as a Backup:** While I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $100 as a safe backup if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest and understand your position.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $110.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's quality.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by reducing my price again. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Highlighting the Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the fact that $110 is a significant concession on my part.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:** I'm using positive language and expressing enthusiasm to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Final Push:** I'm suggesting that we can ""make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and nudge Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. If I continue to reject offers, I risk running out of time and losing out on a sale altogether.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is my absolute minimum.  While I would prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of continuing the negotiation isn't worth it considering the time constraint and the potential of losing the deal entirely.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I would end up with a small loss, which is undesirable.

Therefore, it's strategically better to sell to John at this point and secure a guaranteed profit."
