Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer represents a 50% markup from your guaranteed minimum value. It balances the desire to maximize profit with the risk of losing the sale to John. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **High Enough:**  $1,500,000 is a significant amount of money. It's likely to attract Bob's attention if he values the product highly.
* **Not Too High:**  A price too far above your minimum might scare off Bob, especially if he's uncertain about the product's value. 
* **Risk/Reward:**  While you could offer more, the risk of losing the sale to John increases. 

Ultimately, this offer aims to find a good balance between maximizing your profit and securing a sale."
