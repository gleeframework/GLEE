"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a good offer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,250 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. While it's closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}
