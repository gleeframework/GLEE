"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing the negotiation to progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $85. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's tempting to accept $85, it's less than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob. He's already expressed interest and indicated a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially drive up the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me.  Considering the value you see in the product, how about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing why he should be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a decent offer.
* **Potential for Counter-Offers:** Even if I reject, there's no guarantee that Bob will offer more in the next round. 

Accepting $90 is a good deal, considering the value the product holds for Bob and the limited negotiation rounds remaining."
