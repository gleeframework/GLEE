"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from my usual asking price and still allows you a healthy profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating further to try and get a better price. You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This would still allow you a good return on your investment, and it's closer to a price that works for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above your budget. While it's closer to your ideal price, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. You're better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees you the product at your maximum price and avoids any further potential for delay or price increases."
