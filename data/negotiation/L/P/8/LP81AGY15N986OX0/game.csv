"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from my usual asking price and still allows you a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This would still allow you a good return on your investment, and it's closer to a price that works for me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
