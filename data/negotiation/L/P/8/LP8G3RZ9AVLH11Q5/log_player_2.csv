"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing a fair price. I propose we start with a price of $12,000. This allows us some room to negotiate while ensuring I receive a fair return for my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,000. This offers a compromise between our positions and maintains a reasonable profit margin for me. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's target or, if unsuccessful, to move on to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I am willing to consider $9,500 as a compromise price for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being fair to you. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees him the lowest price and avoids further negotiation that might not yield a better result."
