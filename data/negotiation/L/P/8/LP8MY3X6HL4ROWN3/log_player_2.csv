# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to your needs, considering its high value to you. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to offer you our premium product for $13,500. This price reflects the value we place on the transaction and aims to provide a reasonable profit for us while still being attractive to you. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.

Bob should accept the offer. $13,500 is a good deal, and it's better than going with John at $15,000.  While he might be able to get it down further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and him being stuck with John's price isn't worth it."
