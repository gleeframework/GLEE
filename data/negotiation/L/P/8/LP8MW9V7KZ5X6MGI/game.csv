"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While $1,450,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $1,700,000?  This price reflects the true value of this product and its potential for a significant return. ",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. What do you think?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
