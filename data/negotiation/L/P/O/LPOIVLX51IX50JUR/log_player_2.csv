``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is very unlikely to go any lower.  Accepting the offer at $792,500 secures a good price for you.  Continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and you risk Alice becoming firmer on her price or you being forced to buy from John at the higher price."
