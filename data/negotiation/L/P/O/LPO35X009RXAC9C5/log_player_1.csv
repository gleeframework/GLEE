Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** While I don't explicitly state the product's worth to me, mentioning ""its value"" subtly implies it's significant. 
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning listing it publicly, I subtly hint that Bob might lose out if he doesn't take the offer.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
