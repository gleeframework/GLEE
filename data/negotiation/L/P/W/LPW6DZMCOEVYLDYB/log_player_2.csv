"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice's offer is exactly that amount.  Rejecting her offer means you can still buy the product from John for the same price. This strategy gives you no advantage in terms of price but doesn't put you at a disadvantage either. It might be a good idea to try and negotiate with Alice, but the provided information doesn't allow for that."
