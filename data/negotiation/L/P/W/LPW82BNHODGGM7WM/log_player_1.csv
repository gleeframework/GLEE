Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than what I would be willing to sell it to John for. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to sell for $115, Bob's offer is still a good deal for me.  It's above the value the product has to him, and I'd still earn more than if I sold it to John."
