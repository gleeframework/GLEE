"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would $12,500 work for you?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $12,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for you.  This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, this is a valuable product and I'm keen to make a deal, but I need to be firm on my price. My final offer is $10,500. This is a significant concession and reflects my best possible offer.",10500.0,Alice,7,
