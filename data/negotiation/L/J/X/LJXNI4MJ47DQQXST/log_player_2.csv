"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, which is a fair price given its quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Since I think the product is worth more to me than $150, but not as much as $120 to Alice, I'll offer $90.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway, but still keep the price relatively low. I'll offer $110.
