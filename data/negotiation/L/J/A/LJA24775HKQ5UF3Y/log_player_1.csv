Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $170 for it. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** While Bob only values the product at $100, you have a guaranteed buyer at $150.  Therefore, it makes sense to start with a price above Bob's valuation but below John's.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere closer to his valuation while still getting you a better price than John. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob's willingness to pay, you could adjust your strategy accordingly."
