"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we work something out closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $825,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to get a good deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. I can see that you're willing to pay $750,000, but I still need to get as close to my target as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",795000.0,Alice,5,,
