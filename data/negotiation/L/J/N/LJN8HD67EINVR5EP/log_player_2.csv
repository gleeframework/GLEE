"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's opening offer isn't outrageous, it's still significantly higher than John's price. Bob has room to negotiate and should try to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we work something out closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Establish a strong starting point:**  By aiming significantly lower than Alice's offer, Bob sets the stage for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will help determine how eager Alice is to sell and how much she might be willing to budge. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** Bob can afford to go higher if needed, while still staying well below his $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $825,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to get a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above John's price. Bob has leverage knowing he has a backup option and should push for a better deal.  There's no rush to accept an offer that's still significantly over his ideal budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair price to me."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady upward movement:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer to show willingness but remains firm on staying below $800,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer probes Alice's flexibility without conceding too much ground too quickly.
* **Maintaining a backup:** Bob keeps John's offer in mind, which allows him to negotiate confidently without the pressure of needing to secure the deal at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. I can see that you're willing to pay $750,000, but I still need to get as close to my target as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $795,000, which is only slightly below Bob's maximum budget and very close to John's offer of $800,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are minimal and outweighed by the risk that she might not budge.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy from John at a price he knows is secure."
