"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you halfway at $120. Would you be interested in taking it from there?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $70? That's a fair price considering it's closer to my initial offer.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $100. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",100.0,Alice,5,
