"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be interested. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I'll make a counter offer to see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still gives room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you halfway at $120. Would you be interested in taking it from there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down considerably, but $120 is still over my budget. I'll counter offer to try and reach a compromise closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $70? That's a fair price considering it's closer to my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving and inches closer to my $80 limit.  By pointing out it's closer to my initial offer, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to make a larger concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $100. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is firm at $100, which is still above my $80 limit.  It seems unlikely she'll come down further. I'd rather secure the product from John at my target price than risk further negotiation with Alice."
