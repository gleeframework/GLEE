"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm starting the bidding at $1500000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to try and make this work.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product, while also being fair to both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1200000 is closer to what I'm looking to spend, I still feel it's a bit high. Could you consider $950000 as a compromise?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This is a fair price that takes both of our needs into account.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with $1025000 as a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
