"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for a price that's sure to be a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a price that works for both of us!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than her product valuation ($8,000). There's room for negotiation.
* You have a backup option with John at $12,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price, potentially leading to a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
