"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to buy the product for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has indicated this is her ""best and final offer"" for now, implying further negotiation might be difficult.
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice walking away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. 

While Bob might prefer a lower price, accepting this offer guarantees a purchase within his budget and potentially avoids a more expensive alternative."
