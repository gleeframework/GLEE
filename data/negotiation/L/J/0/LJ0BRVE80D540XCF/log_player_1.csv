{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good deal for Bob (above his valuation) and gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects, I can counter with a slightly lower price or, if he makes a low counteroffer, I can try to meet in the middle. If it gets too low, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $11,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm really looking for closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,000?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still below my minimum threshold. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of needing to sell, I'm going to stick to my guns and try to squeeze out a better price. I'll make one more counteroffer and see where it lands."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair price, and it allows me to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
