"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm really looking for closer to $11,000 to make this work for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $10,000?  I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my revised offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair price, and it allows me to make this deal work. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
