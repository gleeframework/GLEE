""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, but I believe it's a more reasonable price given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it's equal to John's offer. There's no point in continuing the negotiation.  It's best to sell to John now and avoid potentially wasting time and getting a worse outcome."
