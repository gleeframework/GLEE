Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is lower than Alice's initial offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product has.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, but I believe it's a more reasonable price given the market value."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
