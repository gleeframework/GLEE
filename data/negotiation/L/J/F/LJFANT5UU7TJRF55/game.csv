"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $2,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, but I believe it's a more reasonable price given the market value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
