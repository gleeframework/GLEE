"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will likely counteroffer, giving me a chance to close the deal at a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is still a profitable sale for me, I believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $8,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a reasonable price considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}

I'm going to counter with $8,200. This is a further compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's previous offers. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only $100 above my minimum, we've been negotiating for a while and I'm confident I can't get a significantly better price.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations, and I'm happy with this outcome."
