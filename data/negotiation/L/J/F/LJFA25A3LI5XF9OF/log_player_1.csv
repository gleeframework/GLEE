Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your ideal price.
* **Justification:** By highlighting that you believe the product holds ""significant value,"" you're subtly reinforcing that the higher price is justified.
* **John as a Backup:** While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, your goal is to maximize your profit.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during negotiations if Bob counters. Remember, the worst Bob can say is ""no."""
