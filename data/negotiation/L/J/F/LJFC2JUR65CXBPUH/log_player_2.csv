Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make it work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $12,500 secures a reasonable deal for you, saving $2,500 compared to John's offer."
