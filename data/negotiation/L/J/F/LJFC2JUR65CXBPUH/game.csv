"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do better than $10,500, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make it work.",12500.0,Alice,5,
