Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still being significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate.  

Let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it and proceed to the next round. $950,000 is too low of a price, especially considering the product's value to both of us. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and closer to my desired price.  I'll accept this offer."
