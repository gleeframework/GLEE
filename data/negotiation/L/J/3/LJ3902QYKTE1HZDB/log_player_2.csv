Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than my original price. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  She's consistently countered with smaller concessions, indicating she's trying to maximize her profit. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potential saving of only $250.  Buying from John guarantees the product at your target price."
