"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget.  It's not worth considering.  It's much better to see if I can negotiate a lower price or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Alice might be willing to negotiate down to my price, especially since she's clearly motivated to sell.  If she rejects it, I'll have to consider going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but $14,000 is still above my ideal price. I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. I believe this price is fair and still within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to my budget.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price. I still have a few rounds left and I don't want to rush into a decision that I'll regret later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget.  I believe she's getting closer to accepting, and this offer might just be enough to close the deal. If she rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite within my comfort zone.  I'm going to see if I can get her to go a little lower.  If she rejects my next offer, I'm strongly considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push. I'm increasing my offer to $12,000, which is a small step closer to Alice's last offer. I think this might be the sweet spot where we can both agree. If Alice rejects this, I'm going to buy from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate if we can't find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice finally came down to my price!  This is a great deal for me.  While I'd love to have gotten it for $8,000, I'm happy to accept $12,000 and close this deal.  It's much better than going with John and missing out on the product."
