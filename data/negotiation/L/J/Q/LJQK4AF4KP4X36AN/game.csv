"Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,4,
