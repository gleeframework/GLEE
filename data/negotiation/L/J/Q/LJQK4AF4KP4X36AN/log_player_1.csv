Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer above Bob's value:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting the deal:** Emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob might encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately triggering a rejection. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll always keep John's offer of $10,000 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $8,000 is a decent offer, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired profit.  
* **Potential for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price closer to my target.

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer above Bob's value:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 but still lower than my minimum $10,000. This keeps the negotiations moving.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize that I'm willing to compromise, signaling that I'm open to reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that the price is still a good deal for Bob, suggesting that it's a fair compromise. 
* **Building rapport:** I use friendly language (""Hi Bob,"" ""I understand"") to maintain a positive tone and keep the conversation flowing. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and bring us closer to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's persistence:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer, unwilling to move even slightly.
* **Time is valuable:** Further negotiation could be time-consuming and ultimately lead to a lower price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees the minimum profit I want.  

By selling to John, I avoid the risk of continued negotiation that might lead to a lower price, and I secure the best deal available at this moment."
