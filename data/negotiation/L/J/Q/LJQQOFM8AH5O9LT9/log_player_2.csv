"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You can get the product for $12,000 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **You still save money:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000), you're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John."
