"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm confident it would be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  This is a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,000 is my absolute minimum.  This price is still well below what the product is worth to you, and it allows us to finalize this deal quickly.",10000.0,Alice,5,
