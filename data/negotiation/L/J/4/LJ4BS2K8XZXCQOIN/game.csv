"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still gives you a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
