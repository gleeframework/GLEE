"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is around $1500000. However, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can aim for a lower price, potentially getting closer to Alice's value of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore this possibility."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is within your budget and still allows you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.

Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice, securing the product at a good price."
