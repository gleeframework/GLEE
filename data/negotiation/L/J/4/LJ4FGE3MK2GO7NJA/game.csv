"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is around $1500000. However, I'm willing to make a concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1250000? This would be a great deal for me, and I'm sure you'd still be making a profit.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
