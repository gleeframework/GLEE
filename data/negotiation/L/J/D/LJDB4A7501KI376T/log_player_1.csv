{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a high price:** $13,000 is above the product's worth to Bob, but not too far off to make it immediately unreasonable.
* **Expressing confidence:** The message is positive and suggests the product is valuable, hopefully making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and start a discussion. 

Remember, I'm trying to maximize profit, but also need to be mindful of Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I want to sell the product, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can do $9,800. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, $9,800 is still below my desired value. I'm not yet ready to settle for such a low price. I'll make another counteroffer to try to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,150?  That's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I can do $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement.  Rather than continue a lengthy and potentially fruitless negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get my desired value."
