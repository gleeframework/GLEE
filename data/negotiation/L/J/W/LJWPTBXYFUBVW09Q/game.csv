"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the sale.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $10,500, which would be $10,250. Can you consider this revised offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,
