We're still quite a bit away from a price I'd be happy with. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to her price than mine. One more counter offer might do the trick."

It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly from $7100, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer being rejected. John offers a guaranteed price of $8000, which is a better outcome than potentially ending up closer to $7100 or higher."
