Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $800,000.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will be well worth it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position and allows for room to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value to me, without explicitly revealing my minimum. This subtly pressures Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I phrase the offer in a way that suggests I'm open to discussion, implying flexibility in my price. 
* **Prepared for a Counteroffer:** I am prepared to receive and potentially negotiate with Bob's counteroffers.

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on limited information about Bob. If you have any insight into his budget or need for the product, you can adjust your offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's not significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John at $800,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $850,000 and $1,000,000.  My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I acknowledge your offer,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $950,000? This would still be a significant deal for you, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasize Value and Deal:** I reiterate the product's value and point out that $950,000 is still a good deal for Bob. This helps to justify the counteroffer.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I'm using a polite and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'm ready to receive Bob's response and either accept his counteroffer or continue negotiating until we reach an agreement or I decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $925000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my ideal target of $950,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or a prolonged negotiation process, which could risk me selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a good deal and move on.

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction.  This ensures I get a price significantly higher than my minimum and avoids the potential risks of further negotiation."
