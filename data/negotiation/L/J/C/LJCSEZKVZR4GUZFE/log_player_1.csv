{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough that Bob might consider it, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  I'm willing to go lower, but I won't accept anything below $1,200,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll counteroffer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground.  John is still a viable option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise that considers both of our positions. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? It's a fair price that's closer to my ideal value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing both Bob and John is too high.  $1,062,500 is a decent profit, and it's better to secure the sale than to chase a higher price."
