"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in your product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise that considers both of our positions. Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500? It's a fair price that's closer to my ideal value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
