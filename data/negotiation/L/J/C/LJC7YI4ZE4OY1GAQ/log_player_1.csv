``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum. I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly and avoid lengthy negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by countering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. This still keeps my budget in check while acknowledging the value of the product. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with a price of $102.5 for the product. This keeps my budget intact while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob. It's better to sell to John for $120 and guarantee my minimum profit."
