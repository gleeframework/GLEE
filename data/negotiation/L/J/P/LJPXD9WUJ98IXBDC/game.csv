"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're getting closer to my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
