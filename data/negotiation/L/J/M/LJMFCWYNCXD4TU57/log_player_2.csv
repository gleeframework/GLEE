"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $12,000, while John is selling for $15,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:**  You're willing to spend up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is lower than that. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $3,000."
