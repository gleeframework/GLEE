``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate.  It also includes a friendly message that encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,500?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

The negotiation has stalled, and Bob is unwilling to go higher than $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we will end up at the same price as John's offer.  Therefore, it's more efficient and less time consuming to sell the product to John."
