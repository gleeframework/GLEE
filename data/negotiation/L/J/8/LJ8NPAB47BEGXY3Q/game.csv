"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
