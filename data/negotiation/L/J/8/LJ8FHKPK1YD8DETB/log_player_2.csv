It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  Here's why:

* **Stalemate:** We're stuck in a price range where neither of us is budging significantly.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation with Alice risks losing the product altogether, forcing us to buy from John at the highest price.
* **Acceptable Alternative:** While John's price is higher ($1,200,000), it guarantees we acquire the product and sets a firm limit on our spending.

Continuing with Alice at this point is unlikely to yield a significant price drop, and we risk losing the product entirely. Buying from John ensures we obtain the product and avoids the risk of overpaying further."
