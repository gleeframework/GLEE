"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would still give you a good profit and leave room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a significant saving for me, and still provide you with a solid profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. Considering your offer, I'll make a new counteroffer. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is my original offer plus a small adjustment to show I'm willing to be flexible. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
