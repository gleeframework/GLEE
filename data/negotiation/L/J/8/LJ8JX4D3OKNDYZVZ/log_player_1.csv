Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you coming back with a price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

```
I'll take $140 for it. 
```
This is a good outcome. Accepting $140 is better than continuing to negotiate and risking Bob walking away. It's also better than selling to John for $150, as it saves Bob some money and builds a bit of goodwill."
