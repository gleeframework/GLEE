"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a fantastic opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above his target of $1,000,000. He can still get the product for a better price from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,050,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is still a good price considering its value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000. Since John is willing to sell the product for Bob's target price, it makes more sense to buy from John."
