Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's potential for Bob to counteroffer and for you to negotiate a price that is mutually beneficial. 
* **It's reasonable for Bob:**  While $120 is less than the product's worth to Bob, it's still a good deal for him, leaving him with a $30 profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't leave much room for profit. I will try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? This would give you a good price and leave me with a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $100 is still less than what I initially hoped for, it's a much better offer than selling to John for $80.  It's also a fair price for Bob, considering the value of the product to him.  I will accept Bob's offer."
