Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth. How about we set the product price at $799,999? This would still allow you to gain some profit while ensuring I can afford the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $799,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $799,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for practically nothing. I'll counteroffer and see if he's willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Would it be possible to agree on a price of $810,000 for the product? This would allow us to stay close to the actual value while providing a reasonable margin for you.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $810,000 is a good compromise. It's close to my minimum acceptable price and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower offer or even a sale to John for the lower price of $800,000."
