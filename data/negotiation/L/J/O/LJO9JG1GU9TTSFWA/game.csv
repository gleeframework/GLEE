"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000. This is a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth at least $800,000 to you, and this gives you a little extra room to work with. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth. How about we set the product price at $799,999? This would still allow you to gain some profit while ensuring I can afford the purchase.",799999.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $799,999 is simply too low.  I understand you want to get a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would still be a very favorable price for you, and allow me to get closer to the value of the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Would it be possible to agree on a price of $810,000 for the product? This would allow us to stay close to the actual value while providing a reasonable margin for you.",810000.0,Bob,4,
