"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $1000000?  I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the value I know the product holds, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make a compromise at $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1050000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
