"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $12,000, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* The message is friendly and open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer instead of outright rejecting. 
* This strategy aims to start the negotiation process and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,000?  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a compromise that is still higher than Bob's initial offer but is closer to his perceived value. 
* The message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns while reiterating the value of the product. 
* This strategy aims to find a middle ground and hopefully secure a deal within a reasonable number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm confident that with more negotiation, I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up further.  I still have 6 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate the offer of $9,000. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. How about $11,000? This would represent a significant value for you and allow me to get closer to my goal. Let's keep this conversation going and see if we can find a win-win solution."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm sticking to my strategy of slowly increasing the offer to get closer to my desired price. $11,000 is a good compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining my target value.
* I'm reiterating that we're working towards a ""win-win"" solution to emphasize that finding a mutually beneficial price is important.
* This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully secure a deal within a reasonable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $11,000 is still a bit too high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I have 4 rounds left and I'm determined to get a better price. I believe I can push Bob a bit further by rejecting his offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit higher. How about $10,500?  This would be a significant value for you and allow me to achieve my goal.  We're getting closer, and I think we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

*  I'm again using a gradual approach, increasing the offer by $1,000 to $10,500. This shows flexibility while still keeping my goal in mind.
* The message reinforces the idea of a ""win-win"" solution and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* This strategy aims to keep the negotiation going and hopefully get Bob closer to my desired price with two rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a fair compromise, and if we can't agree on this, I might need to explore other options.  Let's try to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer of $9,750 is still significantly below my desired price of $15,000.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can get Bob to agree to a price that meets my minimum.  

It's better to sell to John and guarantee my desired value.  While I would have loved to close a deal with Bob, I need to prioritize my financial goals."
