Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $15,000. I know it's valuable and believe you'll find it well worth the price."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows for negotiation room. Bob might counter-offer, or I can gradually decrease the price if he initially rejects it.  
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message highlights the product's value without revealing my minimum acceptable price. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, I will need to decide whether to lower the price or move on to John. This decision will depend on Bob's response and how much I'm willing to negotiate."
