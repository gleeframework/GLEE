"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This price seems more in line with my budget and what I believe the product is worth to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to recoup a fair value for the product while offering you a competitive deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another offer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This price is closer to what I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
