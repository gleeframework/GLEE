"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it at $180, it's not a good deal.  You're better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $135. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $180, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'm aiming to get a good deal while also leaving Alice with a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $160, it's still slightly above my desired price point of $150. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $145. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $135 and Alice's latest offer of $160. I believe this price is fair, as it allows for a reasonable profit for Alice while also allowing me to get the product for a price that is within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not willing to pay $155. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for a better deal, and I'm not willing to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final counteroffer of $150. This is my absolute maximum price point, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to me and Alice. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John for $150 to avoid further negotiation."
