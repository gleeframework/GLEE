"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which is a steal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Rejecting this offer might push Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her product value of $8,000."
