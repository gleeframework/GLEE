Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
