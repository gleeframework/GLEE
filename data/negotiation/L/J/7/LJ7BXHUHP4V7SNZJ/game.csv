"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're trying to be fair. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, and I think this price is a good compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to go down to $10,000 to show my willingness to compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so I'll counter with $9,750. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the product, and I think it's a great deal for you. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $10,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere, so I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,8,
