"Alice, $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $120.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised by coming down from $180 to $160 and now to $160 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $155. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",155.0,Alice,5,
