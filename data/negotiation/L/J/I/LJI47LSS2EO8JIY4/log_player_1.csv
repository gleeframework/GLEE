Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but not so high as to immediately scare Bob away.
* **The message** is friendly and open to negotiation, showing I'm willing to work with Bob. 
* This strategy aims to start the negotiation process and gauge Bob's interest without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I believe I can still get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would be less profitable, and I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the value of the product. This helps maintain a positive and open tone. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering a middle ground price shows I'm flexible and willing to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and represents a good compromise.  At this point, I'm not confident that further negotiation with Bob will yield a significantly better offer.  Continuing to reject offers could risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice to maximize my profits."
