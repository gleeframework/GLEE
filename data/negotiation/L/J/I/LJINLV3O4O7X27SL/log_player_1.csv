Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but also significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of a deal while still leaving some profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a good price, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my original offer, increasing my chances of a deal closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $95? It's a fair compromise that's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about $92? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer $95, Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price and still significantly higher than selling to John. This is a good compromise that ensures a profitable sale."
