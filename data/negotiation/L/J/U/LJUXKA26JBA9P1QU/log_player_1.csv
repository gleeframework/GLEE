Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also demonstrates my firm stance.
* **Communication:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging while highlighting the value proposition for Bob.
* **Flexibility:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation and counteroffers, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $15,000, which acts as a safety net and allows me to walk away if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to maintain a firm stance and not immediately accept an offer that's far below my desired price. 
* **Counter-Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can present a counter-offer that is more aligned with my expectations, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer of $15,000, which provides me with a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $12,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, emphasizing that $12,500 is a fair price. 
* **Flexibility:** This counter-offer leaves room for further negotiation, allowing me to explore a potential agreement with Bob.
* **Safety Net:** I haven't forgotten about John's offer of $15,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail to produce a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $11,000 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems like further negotiation with Bob might be fruitless. He's already stated his maximum price, and I'm unwilling to go lower than my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could lead to a prolonged process with no guarantee of a better outcome.  Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable sale.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $15,000."
