Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, hoping to secure a good profit. However, I'm open to negotiation.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $82 is above my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's also a better deal than selling to John for $80. I'm going to accept his offer."
