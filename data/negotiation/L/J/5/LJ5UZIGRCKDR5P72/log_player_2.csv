We're getting closer, but we can still aim for a slightly lower price. Let's see if we can get Alice to budge a bit more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is only offering $5,000 less than our last counteroffer.  It's unlikely we can push for a significantly lower price, and accepting this offer saves us $135,000 compared to buying from John.  Let's accept and close the deal."
