"I appreciate the opportunity to acquire your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still provides you with a valuable asset. Let's find common ground to make this deal work.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,700,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
