{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob some room to negotiate. It also leaves some room for me to counteroffer if he rejects.  I'm confident that this strategy will allow me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is a significant profit, I'm confident I can secure a better price. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to make a substantial profit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my previous counteroffer and a substantial profit for me.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price is too high.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
