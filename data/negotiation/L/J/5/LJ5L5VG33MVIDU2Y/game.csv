"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to make a substantial profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
