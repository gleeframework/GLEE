"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, if you ask me!",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $15000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $16000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $16000 is still a bit higher than my comfortable price point.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and meet you at $15000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
