"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $17000 is a tempting offer, I'm hoping for something a little closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to consider $18500? It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth every penny.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $16500 is still below my desired price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop to $17000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a very good value.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but  $16200 is just a little too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16500. This would ensure we both get a good deal, and I know you'll be happy with the product.",16500.0,Alice,7,
