Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $17,000 is a tempting offer, I'm hoping for something a little closer to my initial price. Would you be willing to consider $18,500? It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 18500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $18500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $16,500 is closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher, potentially to $17,000 or even $17,500."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $16,500 is still below my desired price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop to $17,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a very good value."", ""product_price"": 17000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,200

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price.  With only four rounds remaining, I want to explore one more counteroffer to try to get closer to $16,500 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but  $16,200 is just a little too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,500. This would ensure we both get a good deal, and I know you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 8, and with only 2 rounds left, I need to consider the risk of not closing a deal.  While $16,000 is still below my initial goal, it's above my minimum and only $500 less than my previous offer.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept a counteroffer, and selling to John for $15,000 is now a very real possibility.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer and securing the sale is the most prudent decision at this point."
