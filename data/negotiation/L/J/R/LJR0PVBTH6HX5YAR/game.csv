"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's work together to reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price represents a considerable discount while still reflecting the product's inherent worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a substantial difference from my valuation. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
