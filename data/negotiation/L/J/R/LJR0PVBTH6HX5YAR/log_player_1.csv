"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's work together to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price represents a considerable discount while still reflecting the product's inherent worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
 
We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. Bob is showing willingness to move towards a higher price.  Let's see if we can get him closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a substantial difference from my valuation. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm ready to offer $950,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Accepting $950,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
