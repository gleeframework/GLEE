"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a good price considering the value of the product for you.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value to both of us. Let's reach a deal before we run out of time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.
