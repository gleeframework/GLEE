"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to try to negotiate further and see if we can get a lower price. Buying from John at this point is a worse deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a good price considering the value of the product for you.  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be a significantly worse deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value to both of us. Let's reach a deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is closer to my target price of $1,100,000.  While I'd prefer to get it for that price, we're running out of rounds. If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice will either raise her price again, or we'll run out of time and I'll have to buy from John for a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a decent price before the deadline."
