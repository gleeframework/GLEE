"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $7500 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $8250. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $7800? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,
