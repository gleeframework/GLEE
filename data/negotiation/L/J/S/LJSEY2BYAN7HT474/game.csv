"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $14000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $10000, which is a fair compromise. If you're willing to consider this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  $10000 is a fair offer, but I need to be a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12000? This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $12000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good price. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer you the product for $11500. This is a good price for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,7,
