Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is around the $10,000 mark, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What would you consider a fair offer?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than your ideal selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit. 
* **Gauge Interest and Flexibility:**  By phrasing the initial message openly and asking for Bob's input, we can gauge his level of interest and price flexibility. If he's immediately turned off by $12,000, we know we need to adjust downwards significantly. If he counters with a price closer to $10,000, we know we have a good chance of securing a deal above our minimum.
* **Backup Option:**  We have the security of John's offer at $10,000. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our initial ask, knowing we have a safety net."
