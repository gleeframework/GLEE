"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value is around the $10,000 mark, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What would you consider a fair offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000 and higher than John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can pursue a better deal with John."
