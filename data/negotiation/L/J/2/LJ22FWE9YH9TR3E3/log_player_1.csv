Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:**  You're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear starting point for negotiation:** It allows Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants a lower price. 

By starting at $115, you leave yourself room to negotiate further if necessary, but you're also in a good position to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, but it's still worth seeing if you can get a little more. By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $112? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $111 is a more reasonable price for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $111 is still a little less than your original offer, it's a good compromise. You're still making a profit, and it's likely that further negotiation would take more time and potentially lead to a lower price, or even a sale to John."
