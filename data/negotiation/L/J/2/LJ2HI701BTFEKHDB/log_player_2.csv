"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's still room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and Bob is willing to pay up to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still leaving a decent profit margin for her (since she values the product at $8,000). This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it's likely Alice will be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is a good price for Bob, especially since it's closer to his desired range than John's offer of $10,000.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal to John and paying more makes accepting Alice's offer the best choice."
