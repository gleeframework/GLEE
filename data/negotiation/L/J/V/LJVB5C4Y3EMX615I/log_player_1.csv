Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I'm not happy about not getting a better price from Bob, I'm confident that this is the best decision for me.  I've already had 5 rounds of negotiations with Bob, and he's not willing to budge much further.  Selling to John guarantees me a good return on my investment, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
