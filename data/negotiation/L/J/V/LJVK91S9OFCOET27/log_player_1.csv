Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while also giving you a chance to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and it seems Bob is firm on his offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
