"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a good deal for you and gets us closer to a deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
