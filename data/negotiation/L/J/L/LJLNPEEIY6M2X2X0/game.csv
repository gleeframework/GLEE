"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it reflects the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
