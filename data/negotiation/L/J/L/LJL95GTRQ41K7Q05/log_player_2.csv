"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell it for. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiating practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially land within your desired range.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John's offer of $100 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice met you halfway, $110 is still above your $100 budget and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit further, especially since you've already gone through a round of counteroffers.
* **John as Backup:** You can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer to demonstrate seriousness but staying well within your budget.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price,"" you subtly encourage Alice to agree.
* **Nearing the End:**  This offer puts you in a good position to either close the deal or walk away knowing you tried to get a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to compromise again and sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go below $105, which is still above your budget and John's offer.
* **John is the Safer Bet:**  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her not budging further. John guarantees you the product at your target price. 
* **Time Value:** Further negotiation rounds take time. Accepting John's offer ensures you get the product without further delay."
