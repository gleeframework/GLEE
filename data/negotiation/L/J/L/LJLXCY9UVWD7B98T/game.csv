"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and aligns with my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs and the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $950,000. This price allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation and understand your budget constraints.  However, $920,000 doesn't quite cover the true value of this product for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay at $940,000. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal.",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm trying to be flexible.  $915,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop to $930,000 and see if we can reach an agreement. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",930000.0,Alice,7,
