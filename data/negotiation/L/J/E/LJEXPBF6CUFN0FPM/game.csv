"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think your starting price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $725,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",725000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering its true value and potential ROI, I'm proposing $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're still valuing the product at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go that high. I'm willing to compromise again and propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
