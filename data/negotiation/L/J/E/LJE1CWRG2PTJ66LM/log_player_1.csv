Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000. This is my floor, as I can always sell to John for this price.
* **Bob's perceived value:** $12,000.  This is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation space:** There's a $3,000 difference between our values. 
* **Compromise:**  By offering $14,000, I'm  leaving some room for negotiation, but still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum than Bob's.  

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (forcing me to sell to John) with the potential for a higher sale price."
