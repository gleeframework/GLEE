,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's get this done!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you do $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this.",8000.0,Alice,5,
