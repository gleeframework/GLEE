"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better price, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $12,500? That's a firm offer from my side.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $13,000, which is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,7,
