"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better price, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $11,500?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. Alice seems motivated to sell, and we can use that to our advantage by pushing a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $12,500? That's a firm offer from my side."",
 ""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Positioning:** By stating ""$12,500 is a firm offer,"" we signal to Alice that we're serious and less likely to budge much further. 
* **Midpoint:** $12,500 represents a midpoint between Alice's last offer ($13,500) and our target price (John's offer of $12,000). 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, adding a bit of pressure to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering $13,000, which is the closest I can get to your offer without going below my minimum. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is holding firm at $13,000, while we've stated our firm offer is $12,500.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.
* **Minimal Savings:** The difference between Alice's offer ($13,000) and John's price ($12,000) is only $1,000.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for such a small potential saving.
* **Time Value:**  We've already spent several rounds, and further negotiation could drag on.  Buying from John now secures the product at a reasonable price without further delay."
