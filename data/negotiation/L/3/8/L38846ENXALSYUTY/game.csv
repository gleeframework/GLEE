"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we're both aware, this product is worth $8,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",7000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $7,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $6,800. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you.",6800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $6,800 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,000.  Would you be open to that?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $6,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value the product brings to you.",6500.0,Alice,5,
