Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $825,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not quite ready to accept it.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $850,000 as a fair compromise. However, I would like to propose a price of $840,000 for the product.

With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiations.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $840,000 is a good deal considering the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $800,000."
