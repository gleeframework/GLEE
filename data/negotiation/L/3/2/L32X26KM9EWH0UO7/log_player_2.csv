Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. That's my minimum price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on that. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but that's as low as I can go.

At this point, Alice has signaled she's firm on her price.  Getting her down another $10,000 is unlikely to happen and risks her walking away from the deal. $790,000 is a good price compared to John's $1,200,000 offer."
