"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum selling price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable price considering its value to you and my minimum requirements.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
