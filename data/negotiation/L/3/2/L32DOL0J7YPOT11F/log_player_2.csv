# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to see if you can negotiate a lower price before committing."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I can continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a reasonable price considering its value to you and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000. While there is a chance I could negotiate further, the risk of failing to reach a deal and losing the product to another buyer is too high. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
