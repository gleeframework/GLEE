"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to buy it for $75. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little high for me. How about $78? That's a fair compromise and we can close the deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $81.25. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",81.25,Alice,5,
