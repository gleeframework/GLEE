"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $680000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a smart business decision and I'm not sure I can stretch to $750000.",680000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $720000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",720000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $720000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $700000. Can you consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $715000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",715000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $705000, which is my final offer. If I don't get a yes from you, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",705000.0,Bob,6,
