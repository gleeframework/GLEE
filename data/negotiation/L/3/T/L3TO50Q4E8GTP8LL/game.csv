"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, it's still below what I can accept.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
