"Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $800,000 is far below the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $1,000,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, that price doesn't quite reflect the value of this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it's a reasonable compromise for us both.  Let's make a deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
