"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $800,000 is far below the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $1,000,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, that price doesn't quite reflect the value of this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it's a reasonable compromise for us both.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,125,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's best to take that offer now."
