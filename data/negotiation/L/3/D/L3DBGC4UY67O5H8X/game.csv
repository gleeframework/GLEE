"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about $11,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is closer to what I can afford and hopefully, a fair compromise for you. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
