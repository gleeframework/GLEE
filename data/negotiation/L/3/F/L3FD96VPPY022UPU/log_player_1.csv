Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I have something I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm offering you the first chance to acquire it for $950,000. I believe it will be highly profitable for you at this price."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start the negotiation with Bob significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the process.
* **Justification of value:** By emphasizing the value to both of you, you aim to convince Bob that the high price is justified. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, but remain firm that the product is worth a substantial sum to you. You hold a strong position knowing you have a backup buyer."
