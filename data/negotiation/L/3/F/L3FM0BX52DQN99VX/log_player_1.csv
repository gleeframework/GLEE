"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as much as possible.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and Bob knows its worth $1,200,000 to him, so I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,000,000 is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counter with a higher offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price that's fair for me. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come closer to my desired price. While it's not ideal, $1,150,000 is still a good deal for me. I'm choosing to accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
