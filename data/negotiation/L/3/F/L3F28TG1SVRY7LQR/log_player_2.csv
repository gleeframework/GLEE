"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save even more by counter-offering. There's no guarantee that John will still have the product if Bob decides to buy from him later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,100,000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,300,000 is a good price and saves him $200,000 compared to buying from John.  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a better price in the next round, and if he rejects, he risks Alice changing her mind or losing the product altogether."
