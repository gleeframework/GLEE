Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to Bob.  I believe it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a compromise from my previous offer and is still above his initial offer of $80. I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offer of $85 is still too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer guarantees me a profitable sale, so I'm going to take it."
