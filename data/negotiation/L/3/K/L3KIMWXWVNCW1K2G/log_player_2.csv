You're willing to pay up to $80. Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and get a lower price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, hoping she'll be willing to negotiate to make a deal."

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my maximum price, I'm still better off trying to negotiate further. Rejecting and making a counteroffer again is the best option."

I'm offering Alice a price that's halfway between my maximum and her last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to get the best possible price."
