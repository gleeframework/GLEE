"Alice, your offer is too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,175,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm counteroffering $1,160,000. This is my final offer in this range, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1160000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,160,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,125,000.  Let's try to find a meeting point.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,200,000, which is still a discount from my original price. This is my final offer above $1,125,000, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
