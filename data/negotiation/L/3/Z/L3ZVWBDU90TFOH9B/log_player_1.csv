"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening the negotiation with a high price of $1,500,000. This sets the initial bargaining range and allows for room to negotiate downwards.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a baseline and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation.
* **First Round Strategy:** I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage at a price significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I believe there's room for a more mutually beneficial price. By rejecting this offer, I can counter-offer and try to find a middle ground. 
* **John as a Backup:**  While John's offer provides a safety net, I'm still hopeful I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $600,000, but it also leaves room for potential compromise in the future. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'm aiming for a fair deal that maximizes my profit without risking losing the sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer. It's my absolute minimum price, based on the value of the product to me.
* **High Stakes:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  After multiple rounds, I've demonstrated my willingness to negotiate, but further concessions are impossible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process. 
* **Unlikely to Get a Better Offer:** Bob has consistently offered below my minimum price, and there's no guarantee he'll increase his offer further.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to be realistic and secure a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
