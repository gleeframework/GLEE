"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your opportunity to sell it quickly.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
