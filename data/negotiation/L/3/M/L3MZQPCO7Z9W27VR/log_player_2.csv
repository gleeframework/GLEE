"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a remarkable value at $120. This product has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. Given its high quality and functionality, I believe it's a great investment for you. Would you like to make this purchase? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum price point.  Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better deal if Alice decides to lower her price to secure a sale."
