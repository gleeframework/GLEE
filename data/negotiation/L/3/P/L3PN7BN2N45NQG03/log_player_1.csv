{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by being too stubborn.  Accepting his offer means I get $1,500 more than my minimum."
