Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the product's worth to Bob, giving him a clear incentive to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $500 difference allows for potential counteroffers and bargaining.
* **Confidence and value:** My message emphasizes the value Bob will get, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Backup option:** I have John as a backup, ensuring I don't lose out if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is my fallback option, I still have room to negotiate with him. There's a chance I can secure a higher price.
* **Strategic bargaining:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500.  This reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Still above minimum:**  $10,500 remains above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reiterating the value Bob will receive, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting we close the deal, creating a sense of time sensitivity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, which is a safer and more profitable option than continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further, potentially forcing me to accept an even less desirable price or walk away with no sale. 

It's time to secure the deal with John and ensure a profit."
