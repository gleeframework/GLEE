# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer of $135 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also cheaper than buying from John for $150. This is a good deal for you."
