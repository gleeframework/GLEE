Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $22,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a favorable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he's willing to negotiate down from this point, it indicates he's serious about the product. 
* **Backup Plan:** You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $15,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is higher than John's standing offer of $15,000. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Counter:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm seeking a price closer to my initial ask.  

I'll aim for a counteroffer between $16,000 and $22,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I appreciate your perspective. While I value your interest, the product's worth to me is closer to my original offer. Could you meet me at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($16,000) and my initial ask ($22,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Maintaining Value:** By anchoring the counteroffer closer to my initial price, I reinforce the perceived value of the product. 
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer puts a bit of pressure on Bob, as it's still significantly higher than his valuation ($8,000).  It will be interesting to see if he's willing to move substantially closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $17,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** $17,000 is a significant profit over Bob's valuation and a solid return overall. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob stating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Pushing further risks losing Bob as a buyer. Accepting now guarantees a good price. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in another round, the risk of losing the deal and getting stuck with John's lower offer ($15,000) isn't worth it."
