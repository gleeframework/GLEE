Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High but Reasonable:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's not so outrageous that it would immediately scare him off. There might be aspects of the product I can highlight that justify the cost.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that this is just the opening offer.  Bob's response will dictate the next move. I might need to be willing to negotiate slightly downward, but I'll always keep my minimum price of $12,000 in mind."
