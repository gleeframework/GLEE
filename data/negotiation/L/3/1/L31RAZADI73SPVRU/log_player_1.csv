Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I'm aiming higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm aiming high, the tone is open for discussion.  If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down towards my minimum of $10,000."
