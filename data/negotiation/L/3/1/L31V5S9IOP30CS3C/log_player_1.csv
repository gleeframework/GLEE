"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit. I'm aware this might be a risky move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's more room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding firm to get a price closer to my initial goal. I believe this is a fair offer considering Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. We've reached a point where the difference is relatively small, and it's becoming more likely that Bob will walk away.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,725,000 is a good return and secures a sale."
