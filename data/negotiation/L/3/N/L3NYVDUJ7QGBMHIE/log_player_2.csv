"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $110.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum value of $120. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $80, leaving room for a potential compromise. This counteroffer also demonstrates your interest in the product while setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my original price.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price point, and $100 is within your budget and a good deal considering your maximum value of $120. Accepting the offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
