"Round 1

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too early to accept this offer.  We can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $90 is a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

We are starting with a lower offer ($65) to give us some room to negotiate upwards towards a more acceptable price.  We don't want to go too low and risk offending Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $65. How about we try $77.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is negotiating, but we're still aiming for a lower price. We'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice! I can appreciate that.  How about $70? That's a fair price, and we both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're inching closer to a price that works for us. By framing it as a win-win, we hope Alice is agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $70, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we try $75? That's the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This price is within our acceptable range, and Alice seems firm.  It's a good deal, so we'll accept."
