Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation while still potentially earning a good profit.  I believe it's a fair starting point that gives Bob room to counteroffer if he finds the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it. I'm not entirely sure what the product is worth to him, and I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000.  While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a decent profit and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price.  It's important to weigh the risk of continuing the negotiation with the potential for a higher price against the certainty of getting a good price now."
