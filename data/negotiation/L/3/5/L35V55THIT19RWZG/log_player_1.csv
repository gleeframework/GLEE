{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$70 is far too low. While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but remain firm on getting a fair deal for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair.  However, $85 just doesn't work for me. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $95 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not confident that Bob will increase his offer further. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum profit and saves me from further negotiation."
