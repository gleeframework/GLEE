"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway from my original offer - would $825,000 be acceptable?"", 
""product_price"": 825000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be. Would you consider $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate and he clearly sees the value in the product. Accepting his offer now would leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous one?  Would $787,500 work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 787500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close. I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I want to find a price we can both agree on. Would you do $770,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $770,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $770,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly skilled at negotiating and enjoys the back-and-forth. While he might eventually reach our $800,000 floor, there's no guarantee he won't try to push even lower, or that the negotiation will drag on. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk of Bob's lowballing."
