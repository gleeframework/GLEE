"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,800,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,450,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is getting close to my minimum.  I'll push a little further to see if I can get closer to $1,600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate the compromise you've offered. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and land at $1,625,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,625,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,500,000 even?  It's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has met my absolute minimum price. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds, and John offers the same amount. It's best to accept now and close the deal."
