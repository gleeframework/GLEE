"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $100, and Alice is offering the product for $100, it's the best option for him. Buying from John also costs $100, so there's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer."
