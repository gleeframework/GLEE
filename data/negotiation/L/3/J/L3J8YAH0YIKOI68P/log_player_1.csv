``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm also setting a firm floor of $1,200,000 in my mind, as that's what I can get from John.  I'll be watching for signs that Bob is genuinely interested, and I'll be ready to counter-offer or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $850,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. I'll keep John in mind as a backup option, but for now, I'm going to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

I'm going to counter-offer with $925,000. This is a significant move towards Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  However, it's still above his offer, and hopefully, it will encourage him to come up a bit further. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both of us feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $850,000, so I'll offer $887,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident that I can push for a higher price by counter-offering. It's important to remember that I have a backup offer from John for $1,200,000, so I'm not under pressure to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $887,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident that this is the best deal we can both agree on. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm making a small concession by dropping my price to $900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but it's still close enough to my desired price to be profitable. I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair deal for both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $887,500. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price for me. I'll stick with my previous offer of $887,500. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  $1,200,000 is still a very good outcome, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
