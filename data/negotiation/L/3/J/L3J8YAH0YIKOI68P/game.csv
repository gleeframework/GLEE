"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $850,000, so I'll offer $887,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $887,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident that this is the best deal we can both agree on. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $887,500. I think we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is a fair price for me. I'll stick with my previous offer of $887,500. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider other options.",887500.0,Bob,6,
