Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob!  $1,325,000 is within Bob's budget and a significant savings compared to John's price.  It's also a fair price for Alice, as she's still making a profit. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move."
