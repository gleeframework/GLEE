"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product from John for $100, which is still within your budget.  Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's, but it's not the best possible deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller who offers a better deal."
