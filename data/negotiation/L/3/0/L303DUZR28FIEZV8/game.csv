"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? That would be closer to what I'm comfortable spending.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $9,000, but that's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $9,000 is a bit out of my range. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
