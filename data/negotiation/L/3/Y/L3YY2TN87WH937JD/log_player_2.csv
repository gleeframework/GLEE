Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still a bit short on the profit margin. I can offer it to you for $10,250. It's my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $10,250.  Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, it's in my best interest to take that deal and save the extra $250."
