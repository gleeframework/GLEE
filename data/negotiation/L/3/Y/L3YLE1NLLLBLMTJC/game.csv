"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, as that's my maximum. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
