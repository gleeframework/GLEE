"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $11,250 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I think it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11250.0,Bob,6,
