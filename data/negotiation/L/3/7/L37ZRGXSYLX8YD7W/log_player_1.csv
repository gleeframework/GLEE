Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. Offering it at John's price guarantees the sale, but I might be able to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a price that allows me to potentially profit more than selling to John while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider. 
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly."
