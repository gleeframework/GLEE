Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it's important to set a high bar early on.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. 

If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers.  However, starting high gives me the best chance of getting the best possible price."
