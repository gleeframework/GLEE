Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,150,000 is just below Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. This increases the chance he'll accept immediately, as he's still getting a good deal. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob negotiates down, you're starting well above your $1,000,000 minimum and have room to work with.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit while securing a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and end the negotiation now, there's room to counter and potentially secure a better deal. John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a price below your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,000,000 is below the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:**  By moving from your initial offer, you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Significant Concession, But Not Too Much:** Dropping $75,000 is a considerable concession that might entice Bob. However, it keeps the price significantly above his initial offer and closer to your target.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's seriousness. If he's unwilling to budge much from $1,000,000, you might be better off with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,075,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a better price, but his latest offer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant profit above your $1,000,000 minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate. 

While you could try for a slightly higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away or become less willing to move. Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids potentially losing the sale altogether."
