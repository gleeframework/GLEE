"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping we could come to a better agreement. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1300000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
