``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, just below the middle point between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and create a sense of opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm indicating a willingness to negotiate, which can make Bob feel more comfortable entering the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum ($800,000), I believe I can still secure a better price. He's already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to work with you, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good outcome.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a price that reflects that value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we try $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm still confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price again, but this time, I'm only coming down a smaller amount. This shows that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but also that I'm not willing to sell for significantly less.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open Question:** I'm using an open question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $1,000,000 is getting closer.  To be frank, I can do $950,000 today, but that's as high as I can go.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a final compromise on my end. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm making a final counteroffer, signaling that I'm close to my lower limit. This puts pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Fairness and Benefits:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both parties, making it more appealing."
