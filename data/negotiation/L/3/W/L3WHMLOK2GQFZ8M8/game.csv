"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential value for your business.  I'm confident it will be a great investment. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to work with you, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we try $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm still confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $1,000,000 is getting closer.  To be frank, I can do $950,000 today, but that's as high as I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique value this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a final compromise on my end. I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Alice,7,
