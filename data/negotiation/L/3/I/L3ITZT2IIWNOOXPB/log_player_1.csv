{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point for seeing how interested Bob is.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if he rejects, but I'm also prepared to walk away if I don't get close to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping for a slightly better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to $130 and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $130 is close enough to my minimum price of $150, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal with Bob.  Plus, continuing to negotiate risks him walking away or me losing time before I can sell to John."
