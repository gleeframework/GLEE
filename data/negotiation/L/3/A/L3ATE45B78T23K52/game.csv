"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market conditions.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'd be willing to meet you at $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is a $200,000 value. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's closer to your budget, and you'll also get additional benefits that will save you money and hassle in the long run. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,7,
