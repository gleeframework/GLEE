"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

This is a starting point, and I'm aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Let's see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the farm."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not convinced this is the best deal I can get. I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob or if it's time to move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether."
