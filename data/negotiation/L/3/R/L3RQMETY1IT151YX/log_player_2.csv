"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  It's better to reject her offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance she might come down, and even if she doesn't, I can always buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $12,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price. There's a good chance she'll meet me somewhere in the middle.  If not, I'll go with John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product considering its value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than my maximum budget. While I'm getting closer to a deal, it's not worth risking further negotiation. It's better to go with John's offer and secure the product at my target price."
