Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob recognizes the product's value to him:
    * Bob saves $50,000 from his perceived value.
    * You earn $150,000 more than your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,150,000, there's potential for negotiation if Bob counters. This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from either Bob or John."
