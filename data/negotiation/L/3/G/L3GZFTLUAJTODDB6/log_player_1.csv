Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to what it's worth to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible while still ensuring Bob accepts the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $925,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Why not higher?**

Going higher, like $950,000 or more, increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Even though it's a ""good deal"" compared to his $1,000,000 valuation, people can be hesitant to spend large sums and might prefer to see if they can get it cheaper."
