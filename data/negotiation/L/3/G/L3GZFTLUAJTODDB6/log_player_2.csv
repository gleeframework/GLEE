# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to what it's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
