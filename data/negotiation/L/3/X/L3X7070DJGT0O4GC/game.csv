"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value and rarity of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, taking into account your budget and the product's worth. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $12500 due to my budget constraints. I propose a counteroffer of $11000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that takes into account both the product's value and my financial situation.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I am still working within my budget constraints and cannot agree to $12000. I propose a counteroffer of $11500. I hope this is a reasonable compromise that respects both the product's value and my financial situation.",11500.0,Bob,6,
