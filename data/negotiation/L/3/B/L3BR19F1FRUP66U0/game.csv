"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects a considerable discount and gives you a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If you're truly interested, let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
