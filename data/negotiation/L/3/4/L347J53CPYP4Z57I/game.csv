"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product holds.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could make a move up to $700,000.  Would that be acceptable?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working to find a compromise.  While $700,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $950,000 as a final offer.  This offer reflects the significant value this product would bring you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
