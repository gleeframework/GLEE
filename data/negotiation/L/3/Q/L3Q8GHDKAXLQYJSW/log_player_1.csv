"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to bite. I'm aiming for a high profit margin, but also want to keep him engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than the $1,100,000 I initially offered. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price, and I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still keeping the price higher than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can do better. I've only had 4 rounds and still have 6 more to go.  I'm going to stick with trying to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I still have 5 rounds to go."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I am still within range of my ideal price. I believe that with my remaining rounds, I can secure a better deal, and I am not willing to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. It's a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I only have 3 rounds left, so I need to be strategic. This offer is a good balance between securing a decent profit and potentially reaching a deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John. Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, and I only have two rounds left. I'm not confident I can get a better deal, so it's best to secure a guaranteed sale now."
