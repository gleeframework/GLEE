"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll still get a good deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. I think that's a fair compromise.",12750.0,Bob,4,
