(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you reaching out!  While I see the value in this product, your initial offer of $15,000 is above my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on it, while also ensuring I get a decent return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my $10,000 limit. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're committed to your price, but I'm still not willing to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget of $10,000.  While it's possible she might be willing to go lower, there's no guarantee, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. To avoid potentially getting stuck in a longer negotiation with Alice, I'll take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $10,000."
