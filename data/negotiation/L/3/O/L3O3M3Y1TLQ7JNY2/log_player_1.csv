Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The Negotiation Zone:**  Any price between $800,001 and $1,199,999 could potentially work, with you aiming for the higher end.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product. I know it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Acknowledge Bob's business sense, subtly implying the product's value.
* **High but Reasonable:** The $1,050,000 price is significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves you room to negotiate down while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of competition and encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive approach might be warranted. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price."
