Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue the product.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  The $900,000 price point allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without me needing to immediately drop to a price I'm uncomfortable with.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By referencing the value to Bob, I'm subtly reminding him of the potential benefits of acquiring the product, while also keeping my minimum price point in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000. I'm confident this product is worth that to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a better price in the next round.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk a lower offer for the chance of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm attempting to reach a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Framing as Fair:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the offer to Bob, appealing to his sense of reason and potentially making him more receptive.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still open to further negotiation if Bob rejects this counteroffer. However, this price point gets me closer to my minimum acceptable price."
