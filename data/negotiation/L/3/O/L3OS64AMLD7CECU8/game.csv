"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000. I'm confident this product is worth that to me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and go with $875000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
