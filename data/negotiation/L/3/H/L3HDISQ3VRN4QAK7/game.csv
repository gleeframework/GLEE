"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise that still gets you an amazing product at a fair price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's still a great compromise that gets you a fantastic product at a fair price.",102.5,Alice,5,
