Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to what I value the product at. How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still too low. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try $10,500. It's a fair price that splits the difference between our last offers."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. We're at a stalemate with Bob, and I've already gone down significantly from my initial asking price.  I don't want to risk going lower and ending up with a deal I'm not happy with.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's much closer to my desired value."
