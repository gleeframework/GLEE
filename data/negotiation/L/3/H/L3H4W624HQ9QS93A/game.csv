"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, which would be $8,875. Can you consider that price?",8875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about we settle at $8,900? This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know your final decision.",8900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750 one more time. I'm not sure if I can go any lower, so please let me know if this is acceptable.",8750.0,Bob,8,
