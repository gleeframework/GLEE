"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That would be fair to both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
