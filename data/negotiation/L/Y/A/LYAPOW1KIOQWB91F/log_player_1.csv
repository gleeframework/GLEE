{""product_price"": 15,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value of $12,000, so I'll choose option 2 and reject his offer. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum value. Let's try to find a sweet spot.
