Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better price for this incredible product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1600000. This is a great opportunity for you to own this unique product, and I'm confident you'll love it.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. You should try to negotiate further, but if Alice won't go any lower, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're serious about buying this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1500000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, and you've already made several counteroffers. While it's tempting to try for another round of negotiation, at this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,200,000. You've saved $300,000 compared to Alice's latest offer."
