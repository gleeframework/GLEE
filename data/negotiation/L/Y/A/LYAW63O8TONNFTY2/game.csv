"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This would still be a great deal for you and would allow me to make a fair profit.",102.5,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $96? That's a fair compromise, I think.",96.0,Bob,4,
