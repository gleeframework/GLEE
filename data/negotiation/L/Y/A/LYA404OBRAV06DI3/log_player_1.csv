Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $135. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $132.50 is close to my desired price point. It's only $2.50 less than my last offer and significantly higher than selling to John. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the sale."
