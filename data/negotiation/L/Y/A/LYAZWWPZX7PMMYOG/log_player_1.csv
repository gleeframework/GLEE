Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $10,000
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $8,000
* **John's offer:** $10,000

By offering $9,500, I'm aiming for a price that's more attractive to Bob than John's offer, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, allowing me to make more money than selling to John."
