"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. This saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation ($12,000),** it's still within your budget and allows you to save money."
