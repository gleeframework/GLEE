"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is a step closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum. You're better off rejecting and continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to your $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to offer the product for $105, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase from John for $80, securing the product within his budget and avoiding further negotiation."
