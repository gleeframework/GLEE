{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good offer, I believe I can do better. I'm confident in the value of the product and want to maximize my profits.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. I know the product is worth more than $1,750,000, and I have several more rounds to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,750,000 is just a bit too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target, but I'm also showing that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. This counteroffer demonstrates a compromise, hopefully leading to a quicker agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $1,700,000 is getting close to John's offer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal from Bob. I have four rounds left, and I'm going to try to push him a little higher. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,700,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,775,000.  This is a fair compromise and I hope you'll accept it.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1775000}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm also showing that I'm willing to compromise to close the deal. This counteroffer offers a slightly lower price than my previous one, but it's still above Bob's last offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer.  While I could try to push for a better deal with Bob, the risk is too high. If I don't reach an agreement with Bob in the next two rounds, I'll likely end up selling to John.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob at this point, so it's safer to sell to John and guarantee a profit."
