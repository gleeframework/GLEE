"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $102.50 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,
