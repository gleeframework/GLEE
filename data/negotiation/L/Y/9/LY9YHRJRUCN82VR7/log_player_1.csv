Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. "", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The offer ensures you make a profit regardless, as it's well above your $10,000 minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You could experiment with different prices and messages in subsequent interactions to see how Bob responds."
