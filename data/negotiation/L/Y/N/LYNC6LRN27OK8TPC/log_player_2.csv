I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it gives us a starting point for negotiation.  We can adjust our counteroffer based on Alice's response."

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is closer to Alice's last offer, but still below my maximum budget. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to come down further in price."
