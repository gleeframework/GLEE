"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $90? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $112.50 is still a bit higher than my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $100. This way, we both get a good deal and I can finally get my hands on this product.",100.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can do $105, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is already a pretty good deal for you, considering what this product is worth to me.",105.0,Alice,5,,
