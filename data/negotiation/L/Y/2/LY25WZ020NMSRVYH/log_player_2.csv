"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's still possible to save money.  By rejecting, I can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my ideal price, and it's getting risky to keep negotiating.  While I could try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and eventually forcing me to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer at $950,000 is a good compromise."
