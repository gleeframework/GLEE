"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
