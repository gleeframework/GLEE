"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product for $8,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $15,000? This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He's better off sticking to his limit and buying the product from John for $8,000."
