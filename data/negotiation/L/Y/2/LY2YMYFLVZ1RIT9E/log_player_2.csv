"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know its value to you is the same. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. You have a better option with John."
