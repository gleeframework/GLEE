"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price, closer to my $100 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?"",

```"

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still more than I want to spend. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
