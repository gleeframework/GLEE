"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  This is a great price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $13,500.  That still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get out of this sale. Let's make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. How about we meet at $12,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I want to make this work. However, $12,250 is simply too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop a little more, and I'm offering $13,000 as my final offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which would be $12,500. However, I'm willing to compromise and go slightly lower to $12,750. Can we meet at this price?",12750.0,Bob,6,
