Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $11,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work this out."", ""product_price"": 11250}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's only $100 less than my previous counteroffer, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by trying to push for more."
