Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions you as a fair and reasonable seller.  If Bob rejects, we can adjust the offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still far from Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.  There's room for negotiation, and we should push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

We're going to  meet Bob halfway, offering a price that is still higher than our minimum but gives him a discount from our initial offer.  This signals that we're willing to negotiate but also shows that we're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we can still push for a higher price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so we'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This counteroffer is just below Bob's offer but still leaves room for him to negotiate. It shows that we're willing to compromise and that we're still focused on getting a good price.  If Bob rejects this offer, we'll have to decide whether to accept his last offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to our minimum and we've been through multiple rounds of negotiation.  We've established a good rapport with Bob and it's unlikely we'll get a better offer.  Accepting his offer maximizes our profit while keeping a potential customer happy."
