"Alice, your product is certainly intriguing, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects a compromise on both sides. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
