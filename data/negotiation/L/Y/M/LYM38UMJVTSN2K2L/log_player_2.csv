"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum price. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than our maximum budget ($8,000) and Alice's asking price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a lower number first, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Gauging Seriousness:** This initial counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice met us halfway from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above our $8,000 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be wiggle room to reach a price closer to our target. 
* **Backup Option:** We have John's offer of $8,000 as a fallback, giving us leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but still staying well below both her current offer and our maximum budget.
* **Signaling Seriousness:** The increase shows Alice we're serious about buying but need to find a price that works for us.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still a significant amount below her offer, keeping the pressure on her to move closer to our range.
* **John as Backup:** We haven't forgotten about John's offer, which gives us a safety net if we can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Alice has consistently met us halfway, and her current offer of $8,500 is still above our maximum budget of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. 
* **John's offer is better:**  We have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000. It makes no financial sense to pay more than that when we have a better alternative readily available.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice takes time and effort.  While there's a chance she might go slightly lower, the potential savings are likely minimal compared to the certainty of John's offer."
