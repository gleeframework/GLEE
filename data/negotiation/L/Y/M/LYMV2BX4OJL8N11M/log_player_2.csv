{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but you can likely do better. You have 10 rounds to negotiate and a clear upper limit ($1,200,000) for what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially drive the price down further."

Accepting the offer at $825,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and saves you valuable time and energy."
