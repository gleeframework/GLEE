"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum willingness to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if he can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's try $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering we're both trying to get the best possible deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,500 is still a significant gap from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still too high for Bob. He has a backup option of buying from John for $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as Bob might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a price you need to meet, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,500?  I'm getting closer to your price and hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
