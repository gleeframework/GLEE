"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there is room for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to push for a better deal. He offers $6,000,  which is still a decent price considering his maximum budget. This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $7,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. There are still many rounds left, and Bob can use those to further lower the price. It is not yet worth it to buy from John at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

Bob increases his offer slightly to $6,500. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal. It's a reasonable middle ground that might persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,200 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, it's still worth negotiating further.  Bob has shown he's willing to pay a bit more, but Alice has also shown a willingness to lower her price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to try and get a better price.  Buying from John at $12,000 is still a much worse option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but he's still pushing for a better deal.  Increasing his offer to $6,800 shows Alice he's serious about making a deal, but it's still under her price. This demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only 3 rounds left, it's time for Bob to accept the offer.  While $7,300 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal, it's a good deal compared to buying from John. There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice might decide to not negotiate further, leaving Bob with the option of buying from John at a much higher price. It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer at this point makes sense for Bob."
