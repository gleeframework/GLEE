Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $750,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $825,000 is a good price, and it's getting closer to my ideal value. It's better to secure the sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this opportunity."
