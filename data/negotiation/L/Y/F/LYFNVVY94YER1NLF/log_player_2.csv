Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for the product. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground, so I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've been negotiating for a while, and while Alice has come down some, she's still not willing to meet my price. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with the time limit running out. I'm better off buying from John and securing the product for a lower price."
