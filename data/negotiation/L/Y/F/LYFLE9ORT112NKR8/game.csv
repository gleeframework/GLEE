"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us.  How about we settle at $15,000 even? This seems like a reasonable compromise.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for explaining.  I can go a bit higher, but $15,000 is still too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?  That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
