"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to give up on the premium value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,600. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",8600.0,Alice,5,
