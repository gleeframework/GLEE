"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,800? It's a compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10800.0,Alice,3,
