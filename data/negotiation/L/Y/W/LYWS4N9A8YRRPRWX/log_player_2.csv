# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to get a better deal.  Bob should counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,800? It's a compromise that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is a good price for Bob.  He's saved $1,200 compared to buying from John.  While it's possible to keep negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers, and the price could go back up.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best choice."
