Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

We're getting closer, but $105 is still above our target price. We have time for further negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to go down to $102.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to our range, we're still not at a price where we should immediately accept. Let's counter one more time to see if we can get closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and say $98.75? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 98.75
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* We're getting into the later rounds of negotiation.
* By saying ""final offer,"" we add a bit of pressure, but it's still crucial to remain polite. 
*  $98.75 represents a compromise that's still within a reasonable range of both our target and Alice's likely minimum. 
* If Alice rejects this, we might need to consider if getting the product slightly cheaper is worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to go down to $101.25. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice is clearly committed to negotiation since she countered our ""final offer.""
* While $101.25 is slightly above our ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. 
* Continuing to negotiate for a small difference might risk Alice walking away, leaving us to buy from John for $120.  
* Accepting at this point secures a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
