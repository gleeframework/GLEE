Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Negotiation Space:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below $800,000.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of securing a deal with Bob."
