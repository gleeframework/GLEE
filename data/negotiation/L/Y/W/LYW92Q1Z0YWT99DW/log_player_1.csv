{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $90 is a good price and ensures I make a profit. It's also better than selling to John for $100, as I'm saving time and energy by closing the deal with Bob."
