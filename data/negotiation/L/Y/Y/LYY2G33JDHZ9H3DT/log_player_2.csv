"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price. There is no benefit to rejecting this offer as John will sell the same product for the same price."
