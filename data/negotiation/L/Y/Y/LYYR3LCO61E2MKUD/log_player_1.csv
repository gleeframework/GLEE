Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high offer ($1,500,000), you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, you're more likely to settle above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique asset"" to justify the high price, appealing to Bob's potential desire for something valuable and rare. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, there would likely be back-and-forth negotiation with Bob."
