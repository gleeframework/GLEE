"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $150, which is more expensive, but at least I can get the product. If I reject Alice's offer, I might get a better deal from her in the future.
