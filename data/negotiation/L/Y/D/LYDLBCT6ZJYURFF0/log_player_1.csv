{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. It also provides a reason for the price, making it seem more justified. This sets the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $112 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hesitant to go any lower.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'll go ahead and sell to him to avoid any further negotiation."
