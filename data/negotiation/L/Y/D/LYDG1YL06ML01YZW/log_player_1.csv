Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I agree the product has great potential, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering my value assessment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
