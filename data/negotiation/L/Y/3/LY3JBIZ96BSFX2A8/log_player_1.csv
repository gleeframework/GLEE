Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I want a high price, starting too high might scare Bob away.  $140 leaves some space for him to negotiate down a little, potentially landing somewhere above $150.
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly is preferable.  This offer balances getting a good price with closing the deal fast."
