"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between $80 and $82?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet at $80? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",80.0,Alice,5,
