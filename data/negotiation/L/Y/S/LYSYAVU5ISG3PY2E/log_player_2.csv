"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's continue this negotiation and find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,125,000 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $1,175,000.  This offers you a significant value, and it allows me to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this offer is a reasonable compromise. It's better to secure the deal at $1,175,000 than risk pushing Alice too far and potentially losing out on a price lower than John's offer."
