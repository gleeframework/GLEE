"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  Given its unique qualities and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 would be fair for both of us.  This represents a significant value for you, and it allows me to achieve a desirable outcome. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's continue this negotiation and find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product holds value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,125,000 is still below what I consider a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go lower than $1,175,000.  This offers you a significant value, and it allows me to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
