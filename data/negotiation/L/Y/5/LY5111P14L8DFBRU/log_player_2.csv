"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I believe you might be the right person for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay $12,000 for the product from John, there is no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You could potentially get a better deal by rejecting and waiting for John's offer."
