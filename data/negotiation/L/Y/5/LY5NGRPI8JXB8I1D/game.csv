"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that I believe is fair for both of us. Considering its value and potential, I'm asking for $1450000. This leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1300000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1300000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1400000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1350000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still staying within my budget. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1380000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and ensures a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",1380000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to compromise.  I'm still not quite there with $1380000, but I'm getting closer.  I'm willing to offer $1360000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement at this price.",1360000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and while I appreciate your interest,  we're running out of time.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm offering the product for $1400000.  This is my absolute lowest price.  If you accept, we can finalize the deal.  If not, I'll be moving on to another buyer.  ",1400000.0,Alice,7,
