"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value to Bob:** I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming to capture a large portion of that value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategic advantage:** Offering a high price initially sets the tone for a strong negotiation and allows me to leverage my position as the seller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can do better. 
* **Negotiation power:**  I'm still in a strong position. By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to negotiate further. 

I will counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic positioning:** This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, indicating that I'm not ready to settle for his price.
* **Finding common ground:**  I believe this offer is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us. 
* **Time is still on my side:** With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. 
* **Seeking a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Negotiation power:** I have 6 rounds remaining, so I have time to continue the negotiation process.
* **Weighing the options:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is an option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000, showing a continued willingness to compromise. 
* **Getting closer to agreement:**  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer of $950,000, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still not willing to accept Bob's price, demonstrating that I'm not desperate. 
* **Time pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the deal. This offer aims to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close:** $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price.
* **Time pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to consider the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob has been steadily increasing his offer. It's possible he'll come closer to my desired price in the next few rounds.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's current offer, hoping to encourage him to move closer to my desired price.
* **Evaluate options:** I will continue to evaluate selling to John as a fallback option, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm increasing my offer to $975,000, showing a significant willingness to compromise and getting closer to Bob's last offer.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While $975,000 is still above my minimum, it's a reasonable price that could be accepted by Bob.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decisive move to close the deal.
* **Anticipating Bob's next offer:** If Bob rejects this offer, his next offer might be around $950,000 or $925,000, so I'm trying to preempt that and secure a slightly better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is high.
* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is close to my minimum, but it's still not a satisfactory price. 
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** While I would prefer a higher price, John's offer of $800,000 guarantees a sale and secures a decent profit.

It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
