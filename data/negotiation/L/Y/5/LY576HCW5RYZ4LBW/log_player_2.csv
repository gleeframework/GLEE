# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is far below my minimum price, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both some room to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I could go up to $700,000. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more concession.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $900,000. This represents a significant drop from my initial offer and should be within your range. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely she'll reach that price within the remaining rounds, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. It's a better decision to secure the product from John at the guaranteed lower price."
