"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is far below my minimum price, I'm willing to consider a price closer to your initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both some room to negotiate.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer. To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I could go up to $700,000. Would that work for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make one more concession.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $900,000. This represents a significant drop from my initial offer and should be within your range. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
