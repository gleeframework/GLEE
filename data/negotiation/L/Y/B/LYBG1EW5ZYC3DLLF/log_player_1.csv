Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is higher than your minimum price of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $130 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him room to potentially negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth exchange to potentially reach a higher price.

By starting with a slightly lower price, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer and allow for further negotiation if he doesn't."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget.  While $120 is tempting, I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and settle on $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm really trying to stretch my budget. I was thinking $115 would be a fair price for both of us. I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While $115 is less than what I would ideally like, it is still above my minimum price of $100, and Bob seems unwilling to go higher. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and ensure I make a profit."
