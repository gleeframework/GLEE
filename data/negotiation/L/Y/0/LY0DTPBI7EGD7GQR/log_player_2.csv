(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $25,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000 to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about buying the product but only within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $18,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I have time and rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to $13,000, getting closer to my maximum budget but still leaving room for negotiation. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying within my acceptable range."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $16,000 is close to my maximum budget, I'm still one round away from buying from John for a lower price. It's worth pushing for a slightly lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:** This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my budget before resorting to buying from John. $14,500 is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing my willingness to be flexible. If Alice rejects this, I'll buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $15,500 is tempting, I only have three rounds left.  It's not worth risking a further counteroffer and possibly running out of time, especially since John offers a better price. I can get the product for less from John with certainty."
