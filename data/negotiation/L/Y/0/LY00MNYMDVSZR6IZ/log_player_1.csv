Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $150 from the sale.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob only values the product at $80. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150.

Since Bob values the product at less than your minimum and you have a guaranteed sale at your desired price, there's no need to negotiate. You offer it to Bob at your desired price, knowing if he rejects, you'll sell it to John."
