"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good starting point, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to settle for that right away.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a better price.  I'm not desperate to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. It's a bit of a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll see if this is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $110. I'm getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer. I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
