"I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $175. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is a fair compromise, considering my budget. What do you say?",150.0,Bob,4,
