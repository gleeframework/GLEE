Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's final offer would mean losing out on a potential $125,000. It's strategically sound to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
