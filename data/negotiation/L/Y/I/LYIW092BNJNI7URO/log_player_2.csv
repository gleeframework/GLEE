{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $11,000 is more than Alice's valuation of $8,000, it's still $1,000 less than John's price. 
* **You are looking to save money:** Your goal is to buy the product for the lowest possible price. 
* **No risk in accepting:**  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you'll get the product for less than John's price, even if it's not the absolute best deal possible."
