"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. With its advanced features and high-quality materials, it stands out as a top choice in its category. I believe its value surpasses $120, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Would you like to explore this opportunity further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since Alice's initial offer is $150, which is your maximum budget, it makes sense to buy from John right away. There's no benefit to negotiating further with Alice, as you've already reached your limit."
