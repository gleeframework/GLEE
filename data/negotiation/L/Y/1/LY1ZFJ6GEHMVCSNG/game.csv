"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this work. This is still a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that still reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",13500.0,Alice,5,
