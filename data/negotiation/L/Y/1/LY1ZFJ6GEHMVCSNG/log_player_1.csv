"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a good deal to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000 to make this work. This is still a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that still reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, the negotiations are taking a lot of time and there's no guarantee he'll agree to my next counteroffer. John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is my minimum, and it's more efficient to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
