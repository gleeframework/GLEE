# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are 9 more rounds, so Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500.

It's a fair price that still reflects its worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still looking to save a bit more.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $10,900. This price is still a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,900, which is closer to Bob's ideal price but still a bit higher. However, there are only 5 rounds left. If Bob rejects, it's possible Alice will raise the price again, or the negotiations could drag on until Bob is forced to buy from John at $12,000. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price within the allotted rounds."
