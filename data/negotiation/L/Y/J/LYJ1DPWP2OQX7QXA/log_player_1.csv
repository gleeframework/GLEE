Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $130 offers a good balance. It's a significant profit margin for you (almost 30% above your minimum) while still leaving Bob with a perceived ""deal"" since it's $20 less than his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You can afford to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and offering Bob a preferential deal."
