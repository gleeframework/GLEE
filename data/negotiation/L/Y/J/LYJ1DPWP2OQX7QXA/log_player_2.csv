"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to haggle Alice down, $130 is already a decent price and significantly cheaper than John's $150 offer. Accepting this offer represents a good balance of getting the product and saving money."
