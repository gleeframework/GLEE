"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives me a good starting point, knowing the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to close the deal, $9,500 is significantly less than my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $13,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining above Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, he sees the value in the product and is willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. I'm sticking to my minimum price of $12,000 and will continue to counteroffer until we reach a mutually agreeable price, or I choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,500. This shows a continued willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable selling for $11,000. I'll continue to counteroffer, hoping to reach a price closer to my minimum before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering $11,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a serious attempt to reach an agreement. If he rejects this, I may reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is now the same as my last counteroffer. I'm willing to accept this offer because it's only $500 less than my minimum price and I'm running out of rounds. I'm unsure if he'll counter again, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less."
