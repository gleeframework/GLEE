"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's below its true value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the true value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his maximum budget but still leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while trying to achieve a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a significant price point for me, so I hope you'll consider it.  Let's try to close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  He can also still choose to buy from John if he feels the negotiations with Alice are not progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise.  He is also stating that this is his final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal.  He is still mindful of his budget and only offering an amount that he is comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you about your budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a big concession on my part, so I hope we can close this deal now. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While the negotiation has progressed, Bob is unwilling to spend more than his budget.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John, as he can secure the product for a price that is within his budget.  

It's important to note that although the negotiations might be close, Bob has to prioritize staying within his budget.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer from Bob, and further negotiation could potentially lead to a stalemate or an even higher price."
