"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as it's below its true value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's a significant discount from my minimum price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning in the message:** I provide a reason for the price to make it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Open ended question:**  I ask for his thoughts to encourage a response and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  However, it's closer than his initial offer and shows he's willing to negotiate.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter to try and close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a significant price point for me, so I hope you'll consider it.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintain a price that's above my minimum.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, as I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him further.  There are still 6 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can close the deal closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about your budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This is a big concession on my part, so I hope we can close this deal now. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising my offer slightly, but still well below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Emphasis on concession:**  I'm highlighting that I'm making a significant concession to show I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a decision now to create pressure on Bob."
