Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let the product go at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us.

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to get a lower price, but I'm also getting closer to my limit."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This would allow me to purchase the product without overextending myself.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,125,000. I believe this price is still a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,125,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

While Alice has come down some, I'm still not comfortable going above my maximum budget.  It's time to move on to John, who offers a guaranteed price within my range."
