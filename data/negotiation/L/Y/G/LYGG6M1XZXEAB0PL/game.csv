"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $160 is a bit high for me.  How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $155 for the product. This price reflects a slight increase from your offer, aiming for mutual benefit.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $155.  Let's meet in the middle at $150. This price is fair and allows us to close this deal without further delay.",150.0,Bob,4,
