""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you make a profit significantly higher than his perceived value. 
* **Balancing Greed and Realism:**  While you could try an even higher price, there's a chance Bob would find it unreasonable and reject it outright. This offer balances maximizing your potential gain while increasing the likelihood of a sale."
