"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant reduction from the original price, but I'm still not convinced that it reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $750000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $1000000, which is a significant concession from my original price. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
