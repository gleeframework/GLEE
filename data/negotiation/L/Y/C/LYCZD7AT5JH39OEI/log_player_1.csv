Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so we want to offer him a price he'll consider.
* **Value to Alice:**  I value the product at $15,000, but I'm willing to take a small loss to secure a sale. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** John offers a guaranteed $15,000, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Negotiation Room:** By starting at $14,000, I leave room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. Would you be open to selling the product for $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:**  While $13,000 is closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my desired value. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to $14,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, as this product is truly valuable and I want to make sure we both find a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** $13,500 is closer to my desired value of $15,000.
* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, showing Bob that I'm open to compromise.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  Offering $13,500 leaves room for a potential final negotiation if Bob is willing to go a bit higher.
* **Avoiding John:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired value with Bob, rather than accepting John's offer immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still seeking a more reasonable price. Could you consider selling the product for $12800? This would allow me to stay within my budget while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:**  $12,800 is well below my minimum of $15,000.
* **John's Offer:**  John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation Deadlock:**  Bob's offer is too low, and I doubt further negotiation will yield a price I find acceptable. 

**Final Decision:**  It's time to accept John's offer and secure a sale that meets my minimum price requirement."
