"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I recognize the value of your product, but the price point is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. Given the unique value and benefits of our product, I would like to suggest a revised price of $1,200,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the product's intrinsic value, and I believe it offers a compelling opportunity for both parties. I appreciate your interest and look forward to your response.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
