"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe is worth $120 to us. Considering its value, I am offering it to you for $100. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $100 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. This is the absolute maximum I can afford right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad you're interested in our product. I'd like to make a counteroffer at $90 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer but still reflects the value we place on it. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than my maximum budget of $80.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that the price may not come down further, or the negotiations could take longer.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
