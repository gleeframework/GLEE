Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, can send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing him to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception and willingness to pay a premium.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  The further you push above John's offer, the higher the risk of Bob rejecting the deal.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and securing the sale with Bob."
