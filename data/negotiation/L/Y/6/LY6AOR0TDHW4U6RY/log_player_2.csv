"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to let you have it for $110. It's a fantastic opportunity to get a great item at a discount, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'm not sure if I should accept the offer or not. I can save $10 by buying from John, but I might be missing out on a good deal. On the other hand, paying $110 is still $30 more than I want to spend.
