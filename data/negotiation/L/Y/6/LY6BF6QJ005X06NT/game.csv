"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could come down to $13,000, which is a very fair offer. This product will bring you a lot of value.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a decent jump from my previous offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $9,000 is still quite low for what I can offer it to others.  To be done with this quickly, how about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I can tell this is important to you. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
