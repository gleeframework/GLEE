"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1100000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to both make a reasonable deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $950000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I recognize the value of the product, $950000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900000, which represents a significant step closer to your offer and a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
