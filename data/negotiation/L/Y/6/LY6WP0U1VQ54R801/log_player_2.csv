"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is above his maximum budget, he should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $9000 is a bold move, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. He's leaving room for Alice to counter, but also showing his serious intent to purchase at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget. It's also significantly lower than her initial offer.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice could become less willing to budge, or he could lose the product altogether.  Therefore, accepting her offer is the most practical choice, as it achieves his goal of buying the product while keeping the cost under $12,000."
