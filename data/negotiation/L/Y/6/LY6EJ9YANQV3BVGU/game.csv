"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value for it, and it gives us both room to make a deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's closer to your offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,550,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to move forward with the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
