You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $110 is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110, and it's getting too risky to continue negotiating.  It's better to secure the product from John for $100 and avoid the risk of losing out entirely."
