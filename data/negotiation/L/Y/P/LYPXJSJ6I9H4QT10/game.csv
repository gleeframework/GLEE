"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hmm, $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $95? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $110 is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,5,
