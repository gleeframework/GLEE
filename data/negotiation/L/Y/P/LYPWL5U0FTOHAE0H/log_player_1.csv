Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $85 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78, as I mentioned earlier, but I can go up to $82 if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $82 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
