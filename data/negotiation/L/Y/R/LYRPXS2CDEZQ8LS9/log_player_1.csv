Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $180 is still too much for me. I'm really only able to pay $100.  This is my final offer.

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much higher than his initial offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will get you close to your minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed sale at your desired minimum, making it the best option at this point."
