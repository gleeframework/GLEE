Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're already making a profit of $40.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth more to him, creating an opportunity for a counteroffer.
* **It's friendly:**  You're setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is a decent profit, it's still below the $120 you initially offered. You have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? That would be a great compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you'd ideally like to get closer to your initial price, Bob's counteroffer of $105 is still a good profit for you. Accepting this offer guarantees you a sale and a decent return.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but also risks Bob backing out entirely."
