"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $127.50?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. ",127.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet somewhere around $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down a bit further to $115, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $105? That's the highest I can go.",105.0,Bob,6,
