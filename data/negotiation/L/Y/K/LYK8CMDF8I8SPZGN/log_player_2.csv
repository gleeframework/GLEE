Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Alice is unlikely to go below $110. It's better to buy from John for $100 and avoid potentially overpaying."
