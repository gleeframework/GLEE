"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, worth well over a million dollars to me. While I'm confident I can find another buyer for that price, I'm willing to negotiate.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You can get the product from John for $800,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $950,000.  It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
