"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to come down to $13000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Since I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive and see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13250?  I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $13,250 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try to push for more, I need to balance the risk of losing the deal with the potential of getting a slightly higher price. Given that we're already in round 4, I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the sale."
