"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected. It also demonstrates that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13000 is a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $13500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $13,500.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can try to negotiate a bit more.  He's still within his budget, and there's still room for a counteroffer to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again taking a middle ground approach, offering a price that is higher than his previous offer but lower than Alice's.  This shows he's willing to negotiate but also has a limit.  The $13,250 offer is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
