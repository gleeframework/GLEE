I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will find this price attractive, but I'm also prepared to potentially counter his offer or walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to risk a counteroffer and see if I can negotiate a better price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above his initial offer of $10,000. I believe this price is reasonable, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.  I've already made a counteroffer and it seems like we are at an impasse.   Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer of $15,000 to ensure I get the best possible price."
