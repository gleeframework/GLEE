"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
It's a good starting point to reject Alice's offer.  We want to try to get a lower price, and $110 is still a bit above our target of $120 maximum.  We have time to negotiate with Alice before we have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a little out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

We're still above our maximum of $120, and we have rounds left.  Rejecting the offer gives us more time to negotiate with Alice and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $105. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $117. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $116. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $116
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has come down a bit, $116 is still above our $120 limit. We have rounds left and can continue negotiating.  It's worth seeing if we can get Alice closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $116 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $111. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $114. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $113. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer of $113 is getting closer to our target, it's still slightly over our limit of $120. We have rounds left, and it's worth seeing if we can push Alice a little further down. It's possible she's willing to go a bit lower to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to close the deal. I'm willing to pay $112. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to walking away, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $112.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and while Alice's offer of $112.50 is close, it's still above our $120 limit. It's better to buy from John at $120 than to risk not getting the product at all or ending up paying more than our maximum."
