"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap - I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see your point about getting closer to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
