"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about we try $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  To make this work, I could do $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
