"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Please consider my offer carefully.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
