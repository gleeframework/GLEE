"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's meet halfway.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $6,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $6,500 is still not close enough to my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you one more time at $7,000.  This is my final offer, if we can't agree on this price I'll be moving on.",7000.0,Alice,5,
