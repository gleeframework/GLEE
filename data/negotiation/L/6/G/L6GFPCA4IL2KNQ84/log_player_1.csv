Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,375,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's unlikely we'll see a significantly better offer, and I'd rather secure the deal than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer."
