Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a counteroffer.  While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's compromise at $8,900.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, and I'm only 5 rounds in. It's worth accepting this offer before we risk running out of time."
