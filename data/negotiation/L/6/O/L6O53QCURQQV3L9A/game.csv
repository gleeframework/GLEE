"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant price reduction and a fair compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at the price point I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you one more time in the middle. Let's go with $8,875. This is my final offer.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $8,875 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you one more time, but I need to be at $8,750 or lower. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,6,
