"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is a better price than buying from John, Bob can likely do better.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At $90, the product is still within Bob's acceptable price range of $100. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $100.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject his next offer and he might end up paying more than $90."
