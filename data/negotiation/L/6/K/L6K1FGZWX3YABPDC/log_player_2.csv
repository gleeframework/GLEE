Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you're aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a lower price point and gives me room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is getting closer to my $150 limit, I'm still determined to see if I can get it lower.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to save as much money as possible. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a good compromise."
