"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product goes beyond typical market comparisons due to its unique aspects. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,050,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique aspects, Alice, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the value of this product to the right buyer is significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,925,000. I believe this price reflects the value while still offering you a fair deal.  What are your thoughts?",1925000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1,800,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,6,
