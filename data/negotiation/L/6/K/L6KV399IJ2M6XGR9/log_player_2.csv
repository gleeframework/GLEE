"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its value to you is $8000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better align with your budget while still ensuring a fair deal, I propose an adjusted price of $9500 for the product. This is a middle ground between our previous offers, and I believe it reflects the product's true value to you. I look forward to your consideration.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to try to get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am pleased to offer the product to you for $9200. This price reflects a compromise that respects both the value of the product to you and the worth of the product to me. I hope this offer will be acceptable, allowing us to complete this transaction.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, Bob is better off going with John's offer of $8,000, as it saves him money. While there's always a chance Alice might come down further, Bob has already made his final offer and it's risky to continue negotiating.  It's a good time to secure the lower price from John."
