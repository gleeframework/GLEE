"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,500 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $8,750. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
