Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, aiming for a good profit, but it's still within a range Bob might find appealing since it's significantly less than the product's value to him. It also sets a positive tone and highlights the potential value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room for a higher price, especially considering the product is worth $120 to him.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is just above my minimum price of $80.  While I would prefer to get closer to $90, it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
