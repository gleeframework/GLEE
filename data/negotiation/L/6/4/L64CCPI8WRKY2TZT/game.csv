"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a fair price considering its market value and potential. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1300000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still reflects the value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1200000.  While that's a significant amount, it's still a bit lower than what I need to consider.  Let's try one final compromise. I'm willing to go down to $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also respecting your budget. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
