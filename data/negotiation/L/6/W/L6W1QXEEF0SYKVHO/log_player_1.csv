"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $14,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my ideal goal of $15,000 but still significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob sees a clear benefit to making a deal with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
