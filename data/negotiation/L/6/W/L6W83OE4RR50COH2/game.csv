"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.  My initial price is $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000, which is the price I was initially quoted by another seller. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* at $9,125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows us both to close the deal. What do you say?",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,125. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500, and I'm willing to pay that price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",8500.0,Bob,6,
