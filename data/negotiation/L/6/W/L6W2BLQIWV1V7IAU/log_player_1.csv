Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if he's seriously interested. If he rejects, I can then start to lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,450,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's most recent offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with John. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best choice at this point."
