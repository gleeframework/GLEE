Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and anticipated demand, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome.  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a chance of securing a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your minimum of $15,000 in mind."
