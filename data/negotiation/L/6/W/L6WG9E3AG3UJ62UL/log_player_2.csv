{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth $10,000 to me, and she's asking for $20,000. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

**Explanation:**

While $17,000 is closer to my maximum, it's still too high. I'm sticking to my goal of saving as much as possible.  I'll reject her offer and try to get a lower price."
