"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
