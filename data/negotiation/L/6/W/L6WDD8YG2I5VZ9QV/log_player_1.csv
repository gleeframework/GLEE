{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by framing it as a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm willing to sell the product to John for $100, which is more than Bob's offer. I'll counter with a price closer to $100 to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price of $100. Even though I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower. John is a guaranteed $100, so I'm choosing to sell the product to him."
