"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $9,500 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with.  Let's counter again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $8,500. Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $9,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close to a point where it might make more sense to go with John. One more counter to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  Honestly, though, $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  My absolute best offer is $8,700. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I think I'll need to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 8700
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,700. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm offering the product to you for $9,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems pretty firm at this point, and we're not likely to get much lower than $9,100.  It's time to cut our losses. Buying from John at $12,000 is less ideal, but it's better than getting stuck haggling and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
