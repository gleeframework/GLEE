Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $140 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still offers him a potential ""deal.""
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing your profit even further. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is appealing to Bob while still maximizing your potential profit."
