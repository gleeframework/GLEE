{""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $1,050,000, which is still above Bob's budget. While further negotiation is possible, there's no guarantee that Alice will lower the price further, and the risk of continued negotiation is too high.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum budget of $800,000."
