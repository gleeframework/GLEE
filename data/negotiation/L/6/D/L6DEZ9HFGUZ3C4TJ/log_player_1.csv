{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility.
* **Protecting my minimum:** I'm  above my minimum of $10,000, but leaving some room to potentially meet Bob in the middle. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm ready to move on to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still negotiate with Bob, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to rush into a deal with Bob if it's not favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Still above minimum:** $9,000 is above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the deal's value for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further discussion, as Bob may be willing to go slightly higher.
* **John's offer in mind:**  I'm prepared to move on to John if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,000 is a fair price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:** $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **No significant room for negotiation:**  While Bob has shown some willingness to increase his offer, there's not much room left for negotiation that would bring us close to my minimum. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could drag on, potentially delaying a sale and costing me time and effort. 

By selling to John, I ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
