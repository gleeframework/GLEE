Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if necessary.
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering a higher price, I'm trying to gauge Bob's perceived value of the product. If he's willing to pay close to my asking price, it indicates that the product is likely worth a lot to him, and I can potentially negotiate even higher.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, who is willing to pay $800,000. This means I can afford to be slightly aggressive with my initial price."
