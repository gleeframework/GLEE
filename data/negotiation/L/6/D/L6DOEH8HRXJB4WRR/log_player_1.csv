"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,050,000? This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would allow me to cover my costs and ensure a reasonable profit, while still providing you with a significant value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer, we're running out of rounds. I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that's good for me. Selling to John guarantees me a good price and avoids further risk."
