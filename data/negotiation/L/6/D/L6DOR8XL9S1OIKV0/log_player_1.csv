Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, exceeding the $150 John offers.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially going as high as $149.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
