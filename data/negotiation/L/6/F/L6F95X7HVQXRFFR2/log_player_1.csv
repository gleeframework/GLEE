"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is fair to both of us. It leaves room for some negotiation but also demonstrates that I am serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my full asking price. This is a fair counter-offer that shows willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can do better with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10900}
```

I'm lowering my price just a bit more, aiming to meet Bob halfway. This shows flexibility and signals that I'm serious about closing the deal, but it still leaves some room for negotiation in the following rounds."
