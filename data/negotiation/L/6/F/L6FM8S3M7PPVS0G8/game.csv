"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 might have been a little high, but $8,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, and for working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer, but still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and call it $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
