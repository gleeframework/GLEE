"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is a starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit for myself.  I believe it's high enough to be attractive to Bob but also low enough to leave space for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a higher price. There's still room for counteroffers and a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate but still remaining above my minimum price. I believe this gives us both a chance to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value, I still believe I can secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. With several rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for an offer that's far below my initial asking price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10,850}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,850. This offer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to come down further while still maintaining a profit for myself.  It's only slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but I believe this is the best chance to reach a deal before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $10,500 is not improving significantly.  While I'd prefer to get more for the product,  it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000, which is at least my minimum acceptable value."
