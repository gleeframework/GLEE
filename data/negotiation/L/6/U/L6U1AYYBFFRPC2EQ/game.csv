"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While $100 is a good price, I'm really looking for something closer to $80.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but I'm willing to meet you a little closer to the middle. How about $85?  Let's make this deal happen!",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $85. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $92 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it!",92.0,Alice,5,
