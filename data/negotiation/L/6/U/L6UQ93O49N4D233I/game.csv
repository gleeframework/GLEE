"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is at least $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a bit above market value, but I have to make sure it's a good deal for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,500? This still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $15,250? That's a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",15250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,6,
