Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Bob is willing to pay significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency.  Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but I have a strong fallback option with John.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:**  Offering it for $1,100,000 gives Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value while securing a substantial profit for me. There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward for a higher price is worth it."
