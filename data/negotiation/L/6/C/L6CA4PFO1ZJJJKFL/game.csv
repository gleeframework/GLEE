I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit outside of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really interested in your product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to meet me at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make a slightly smaller concession, how about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $105 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
