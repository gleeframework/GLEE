"I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $98 for it? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",98.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about $100?  That's my absolute lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
