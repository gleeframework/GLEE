Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value but still gives me a decent profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a decent profit, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a little closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
