"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be really valuable for you. I'm asking for $120, given its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is less than John's price of $150, so it's tempting.
* However, you know your maximum price is $150 and Alice is clearly trying to get a significant profit. 
* By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or get closer to your target price."
