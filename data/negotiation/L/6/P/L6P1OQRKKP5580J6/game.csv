"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $75? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",82.5,Alice,3,
