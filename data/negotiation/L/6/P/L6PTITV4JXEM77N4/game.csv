"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me right now. I see the value in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $900,000? This is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can work something out.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while respecting my budget. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we discuss a price of $950,000? This is a more significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
