{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still reflecting the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still have several rounds left to negotiate. I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price range by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 again. I understand that this may not meet your expectations, but I believe this is the best I can offer given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer. While $1,300,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm hoping a counteroffer will make him move closer to my desired price. I have more rounds to work with, so I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial limitations. However, I am still hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,325,000. This compromise allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from the product."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've carefully evaluated our previous discussions and decided to counter with $1,300,000 once again. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been stuck on $1,300,000 for several rounds, and there's a good chance he won't budge further. I've already made several concessions, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. It's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach my desired price.  To avoid the risk of ending up with a significantly lower price or a deal falling through, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
