"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to finding a middle ground, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for me, while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial limitations. However, I am still hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,325,000. This compromise allows us both to benefit from the deal.  I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from the product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
