,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $16,000?  I'm confident you'll see the value at this price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
