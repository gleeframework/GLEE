"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $120.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $90, the product is within your budget and you're saving $60 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for you, and Alice is still making a profit."
