"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your desire to find a good deal. However, given the high value and quality of the item, I am unable to accept the offer at $90. My counteroffer would be $105. This price reflects the excellent value and benefits you will receive from our product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $100. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your latest offer, I am willing to accept a price of $102 for the product. This allows us to reach a fair compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me.",102.0,Alice,5,
