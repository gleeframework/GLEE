"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What would you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider something around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $11,500, I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to work with you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  $15,500 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $12,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,6,
