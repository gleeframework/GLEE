"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product at a special price. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal considering the potential returns it could bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation of the product. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or ultimately buy it from John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
