"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go lower than $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise. If we don't come to an agreement soon, I might have to consider other offers.",9000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I have to say that I'm getting close to considering an alternative offer from another seller. I'd like to finalize this deal with you, but I need to be confident that we can agree on a price. Can you confirm that $9,000 is the lowest you're willing to go?",9000.0,Bob,8,
