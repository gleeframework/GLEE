It's a unique opportunity for you to gain [mention specific benefits or advantages of the product for Bob].  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $700,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits.  Let's split the difference.  How about $800,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire this valuable product at a price you're comfortable with, and me to get a more reasonable return on my investment.
