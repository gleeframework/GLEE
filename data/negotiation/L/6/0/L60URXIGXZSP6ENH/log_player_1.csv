{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you something incredibly valuable.  While I have other interested parties, I believe this product would be uniquely beneficial to you.  I'm willing to make a special offer just for you at $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification for the Price:**  The message hints at the product's high value and your other options without revealing specific numbers.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Targeting a Profitable Middle Ground:** This offer allows for a potential profit of $500,000 above Bob's perceived value while leaving room for negotiation if needed.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by leveraging your strong position while still offering Bob an attractive deal compared to his perceived value."
