"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm willing to sell it for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since you have a fallback option of buying from John for $100, you have nothing to lose by attempting to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
