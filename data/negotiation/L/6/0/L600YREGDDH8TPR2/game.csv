"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $1050000? This still allows you a good profit margin, and it's closer to a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1000000. How about we meet in the middle at $1025000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
