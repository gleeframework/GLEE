# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it holds significant value that justifies this price. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's not a good deal for you. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite a bit higher to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better offer than Alice's previous one, it's still above my budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'll reject and see if I can get closer to my target price."
