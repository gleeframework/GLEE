"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is right at that threshold. I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway, but still leave some room for further negotiation.  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise, while also ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  I've got a good chance of getting a higher price in the next round, but I'm not sure how high Bob will go. It's a risk, but I think accepting his offer is the best move at this point."
