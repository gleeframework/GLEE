"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $650,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise further. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
