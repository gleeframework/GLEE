"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's uniqueness. However, $999000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875000. This is a great compromise considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of this unique product.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll counteroffer at $850000.
