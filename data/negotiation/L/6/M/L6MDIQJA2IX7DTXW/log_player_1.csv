{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. If he rejects, I can make a lower counteroffer, and if he accepts, I still earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $10,800 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my minimum price. How about $11,200? This price still allows for some negotiation, and it's a good value for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 11200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to keep my budget as tight as possible. I am willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to that minimum, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a sale quickly and still earn a decent profit."
