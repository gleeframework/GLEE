"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $850,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit too high at $925,000. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This price is closer to my target and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $900,000 is too high, but I can do $900,000 - $2,500 = $897,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",897500.0,Alice,5,
