"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob has room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $850,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for less than $900,000.  While Alice has come down a bit, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit too high at $925,000. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500? This price is closer to my target and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $900,000 is too high, but I can do $900,000 - $2,500 = $897,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $897,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $897,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered the price to $897,500, which is below Bob's target of $900,000. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the difference is now relatively small. It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still within Bob's budget and saves him $102,500 compared to buying from John."
