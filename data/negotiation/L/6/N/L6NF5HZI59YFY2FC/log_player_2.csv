# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is still cheaper than buying from John, Bob can still potentially save more by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He's shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown some flexibility.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob a chance to see if Alice will come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
