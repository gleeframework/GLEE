"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Could you meet me halfway at $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
