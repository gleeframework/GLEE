"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a significant discount from my original price and a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm very interested in the product.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $110.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair one for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
