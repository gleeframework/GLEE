Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:**  This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob will understand exactly what you're proposing.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while also considering the possibility of a counteroffer or even going to John. We can adjust the strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than our desired price and even lower than our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of losing more:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for less than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  We can likely get a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $800,000 gives us leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

We'll need to carefully consider our counteroffer to Bob. It should be higher than his offer but still leave room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to go down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  $900,000 is a significant increase from Bob's $700,000, showing we're willing to compromise.
* **Lower than our initial offer:** This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above our minimum:**  We're still holding out for a price that's above our minimum of $800,000.
* **Justification:** We've provided a reason for our counteroffer, highlighting the value the product brings to Bob.

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while ensuring we don't undervalue the product.  We can adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has offered our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer means:

* **Meeting our minimum:**  We are guaranteed to receive our minimum desired price for the product.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  We avoid the risk of further counteroffers that might lower the price.
* **Equal benefit:** This offer is mutually beneficial, as Bob gets the product for a price he's willing to pay, and we receive our minimum.

**Reasoning:**

While we could potentially negotiate further with Bob, there's no guarantee of a higher price.  Since Bob has offered our minimum, and John is also willing to pay the same price, accepting this offer is the most logical and risk-free option."
