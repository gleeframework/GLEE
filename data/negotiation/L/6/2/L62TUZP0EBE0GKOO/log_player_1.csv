"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to negotiate a better price. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still squeeze out a better deal.  I have 8 rounds left, and his initial offer indicates he's willing to pay more than my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit below my ideal price.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to reach a fair price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal price, but we're getting closer. It's important to keep in mind that I have 6 rounds left, and Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  Let's try $890,000. This would be a great compromise, giving you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better than $890,000. How about $880,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my ideal price, and we're running out of time.  With only 4 rounds left, it's more beneficial to accept his offer than risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $800,000."
