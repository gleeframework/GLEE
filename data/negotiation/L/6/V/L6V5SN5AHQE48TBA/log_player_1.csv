Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than our minimum ($80 > $150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $140, we present the product as potentially more valuable than $80 in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob outright rejects the offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, we don't risk losing money by aiming high with Bob."
