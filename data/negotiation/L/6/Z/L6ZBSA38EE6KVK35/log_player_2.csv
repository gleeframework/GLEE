{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and Alice's offer of $585,000 is still too high for me.  I've been consistently trying to get her closer to my target price, but it seems she's unwilling to budge further. It's not worth risking another round and potentially getting a worse offer. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John at $800,000.  While it's not ideal, it's the best option available to ensure I acquire the product."
