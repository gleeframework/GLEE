"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75. While it's better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'm confident I can get a better price through continued negotiation, and I still have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price for Bob, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer to get more, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing out to John or further rounds of negotiation."
