"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget. Bob can get the same product from John for a significantly lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a better price with Alice or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him.  He's offering the maximum price he's willing to pay and hoping Alice is motivated enough to accept it.  If not, he can buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum. He's better off rejecting again and trying to negotiate further or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000, but is trying to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price higher than his maximum but lower than Alice's last offer. This could be a good negotiation strategy to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to go much lower, and the negotiation process is becoming lengthy. At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $800,000 and securing the deal without further negotiation."
