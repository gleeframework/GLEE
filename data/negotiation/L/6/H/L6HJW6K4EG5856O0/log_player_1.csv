Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we don't want to start there. Aiming higher initially leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a higher price ($18,000), we anchor the negotiation in our favor.  Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a higher perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net. This allows us to be firm in our negotiations with Bob, as we have a guaranteed sale price if needed. 
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob accepts the $18,000 offer, we maximize our profit. If he negotiates down, we can still likely secure a price higher than $15,000."
