"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,
