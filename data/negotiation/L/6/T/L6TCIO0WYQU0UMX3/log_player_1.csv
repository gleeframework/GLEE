"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I can afford to be a little more aggressive.  We'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my goal price. I'll reject and see if I can counter for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, and I'm not ready to give in yet. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm getting closer to Bob's perceived value. This counteroffer might be more enticing for him, especially since I'm showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value. I'm worried that if I reject and make another counteroffer, we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. This deal is still better than selling to John for $1,000,000, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
