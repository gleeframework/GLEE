"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to make a significant profit. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good value for my money.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $950,000?  It's a fair price that gives us both a good return.

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,4,
