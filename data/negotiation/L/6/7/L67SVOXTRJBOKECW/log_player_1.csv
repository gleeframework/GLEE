Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You've set a floor of $800,000, and this offer is above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $50,000 difference between your offer and Bob's potential value, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** A reasonable starting offer shows that you are open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. Good luck with the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for you.  While he's willing to go up to $800,000, it's important to remember that you have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price closer to your initial offer of $950,000.  You can consider offering a slight concession, but remember to hold firm on your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain your ground:** You've rejected Bob's initial offer, making it clear you won't settle for less than $800,000.
* **Show flexibility:** Offering $850,000 demonstrates your willingness to negotiate. This is a compromise from your initial $950,000 offer, signaling a desire to reach a deal.
* **Appeal to practicality:**  Highlighting the benefits of a quick agreement (avoiding further negotiation) can encourage Bob to accept.

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffer based on Bob's response. Stay firm on your minimum acceptable price, but be open to reasonable compromises."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we try $775,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $800,000 threshold.  You've already made a significant concession, and further negotiation may not lead to a better outcome. 

Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick, hassle-free transaction.  It's important to prioritize your financial goals and not get caught up in prolonged negotiations that might not yield a more favorable result."
