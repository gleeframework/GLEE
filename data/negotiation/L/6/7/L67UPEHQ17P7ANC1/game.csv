"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I believe the product's true value is higher. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding common ground. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1300000? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
