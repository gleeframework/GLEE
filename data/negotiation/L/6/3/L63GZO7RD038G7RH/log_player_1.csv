Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I believe it's worth more, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or another buyer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's settle on this and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with the value John is willing to pay. I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
