"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $9,500?  This would give you a good profit while staying within my budget. I'm eager to purchase the product, but this price is the best I can offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $9,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which is $10,750. I think that's a fair compromise.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $11,000? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
