"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the market value. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Let's meet in the middle – how about $900,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $875,000 is a more reasonable offer. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.  While $875,000 is a good offer, we are still in the early rounds and I believe we can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's settle this right now - $887,500.  This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your desire for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 887500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm aiming for a slightly quicker close to the negotiation now. Offering a price exactly in the middle of the last round might seem like a small concession, but it shows Bob I'm willing to be reasonable while still aiming for a higher selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your latest offer, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd like to revisit the price and also discuss the terms of the sale. I'm thinking $875,000 is a fair price, but I'd like to propose a 30-day payment plan with a 5% discount for paying upfront. Additionally, I'd like to negotiate the inclusion of some additional support and maintenance services. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly trying to sweeten the deal with payment terms and additional services.  While these might be valuable, they also introduce complexity. I'm sticking to my guns on the price for now. It's time to remind Bob of the product's unique value and the potential downsides of not closing the deal soon."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible value, but I need to be upfront – other potential buyers are also interested in this product.  $887,500 is my final offer. This price reflects the significant ROI you'll see, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.  Let's close this out and I can start the transition process for you."",
""product_price"": 887500
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to create some urgency. Letting Bob know about other potential buyers could push him towards accepting my offer.  I'm reiterating my final offer price while emphasizing the value and encouraging a swift close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're confident that $887,500 is the best price, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you at $887,500, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I held firm on the price, Bob has now met my final offer of $887,500.  It's time to accept and close the deal.  Delaying further carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away, and $887,500 is a significant profit above my minimum."
