Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your minimum desired price."
