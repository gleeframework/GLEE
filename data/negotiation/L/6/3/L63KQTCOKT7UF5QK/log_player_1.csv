Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. How does $220 sound to start?"",
""product_price"": 220
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob's value is lower, starting at $220 leaves room for negotiation. It's anchored high, but not so outrageous that Bob would immediately walk away. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will give me information. If Bob outright rejects it, I'll know I need to go lower quickly. If he counters, it might give me a sense of how much he might be willing to pay.
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob drag on or become unreasonable, I can always walk away and take the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $220 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but could only go as high as $60. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far too low. It's even lower than his own valuation of the product. I need to steer the negotiation toward a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand that my initial offer might have been higher than you expected, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Decrease but Stay Above Minimum:** I've lowered the price substantially from $220 to $140. This demonstrates flexibility but keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my $150 minimum.
* **Justification:**  By saying ""to be fair"" and suggesting a middle ground, I'm framing the counteroffer as a reasonable compromise. 
* **Pressure Point:** Bob knows I have another buyer.  By staying relatively close to that $150 safety net, I'm subtly reminding him that I'm not desperate and have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards my price, $140 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Perhaps we could agree on $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is barely budging on his offer, and it's clear he's unlikely to come close to my minimum of $150. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than wasting more time with a lowballing buyer."
