"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $220 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but could only go as high as $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand that my initial offer might have been higher than you expected, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle somewhere around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards my price, $140 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Perhaps we could agree on $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
