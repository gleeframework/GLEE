{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to start with a higher price than your absolute minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $15,000 is a significant markup from your minimum of $12,000, but it's not so high as to be immediately off-putting to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. You'll need to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response and your assessment of his potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to negotiate a price closer to $10000. I appreciate if we could reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly less than your minimum of $12,000. Accepting it would be a considerable loss for you.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  You've already established a higher price point with Bob, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a more favorable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While you're not immediately accepting John's offer, it's a secure fallback option if negotiations with Bob break down. 

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price between your minimum and his offer, perhaps $12,500, and explain your reasoning for the counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer of $10,000, it's unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let's see if we can reach a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** $12,500 is a middle ground between your minimum and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterate value:** Remind Bob of the product's unique value to justify the higher price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and open to further discussion, making Bob feel like you're trying to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**  Now you'll need to analyze Bob's response to your counteroffer and adjust your strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, you might consider a slightly lower offer or explore your safety net with John. If he accepts, you've successfully negotiated a profitable sale!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still $1,000 less than your floor.  
* **Negotiation space:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is likely willing to go a little higher. 
* **John's offer:** You can still sell to John for $12,000, which is a better deal than Bob's current offer. 

**Next Steps:**

Send a final counteroffer to Bob. Try a price slightly higher than his offer, perhaps $11,500. Explain that you're willing to come down a bit but need to stay above a certain minimum to make the sale worthwhile."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you halfway at $11,500. This price is still within my acceptable range, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** $11,500 represents a final compromise, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement while still securing a profitable sale.
* **Positive and assertive:**  The message maintains a positive tone but also emphasizes your firm stance on the price.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message reiterates the product's value to justify the price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare for John:**  While you hope Bob accepts your counteroffer, you need to be prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects. 
* **Analyze Bob's response:**  Carefully consider Bob's final response and whether it aligns with your goals.

This final counteroffer aims to close the deal with Bob at a price that's acceptable to you while still keeping your minimum selling price in mind."
