"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm pushing the limits. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with him. It's too early to sell to John yet, as I might be able to get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing my price again, but this time by a smaller margin. I'm aiming to show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating with him, but I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum acceptable price just yet.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to raise his offer further."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better price with more negotiation. It's too early to sell to John, as I believe I can still push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still stand firm on my minimum price. I'm hoping this slight increase will motivate Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I have two rounds left and I believe I can push him further.  Selling to John now would be a loss for me, and I'm still confident in my ability to get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm making a final push for a price closer to my desired amount.  I'm dropping my offer slightly to $1,125,000, hoping to entice Bob into accepting. It's a compromise, but I'm still confident in getting a higher price than John's offer."

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is the final round. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's better to secure a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
