{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good middle ground between my minimum price and the product's value to Bob. If he rejects it, we can negotiate further. If he accepts, I make a nice profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than my absolute minimum, I'm not comfortable selling it for that low. I believe the product is worth more and I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or John. I'm going to counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is a good compromise and still significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's time to secure the deal."
