"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than buying from John, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000, so offering $10,500 is a significant discount from her initial offer. This should be a good starting point for negotiation, as it's still within your budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above what you're willing to pay. You still have more negotiation rounds, and it's worth trying to get closer to your target price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to go down to $11,000, I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,750. This shows I'm serious about buying but still want to get a better deal. It's a compromise that might make Alice more receptive to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is now within my budget and a significant improvement over her previous offers. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  Since I only have 5 rounds left and John's price is $12,000, it's wiser to accept this offer and secure the product."
