"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $10,000, as that's my minimum value.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'm aiming for a price that's closer to his value than mine.
* **First offer:**  I'm starting with a slightly aggressive offer of $11,500. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still offering me a profit. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe bet, but I'm not desperate yet.
* **Negotiation:**  I'd prefer to keep negotiating with Bob.  He's willing to pay more than John, and there's still room for a deal that benefits both of us. 

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $11,500 to $11,000, showing I'm willing to compromise. This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to his value.
* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer essentially splits the difference between our last offers, which is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Building momentum:** If Bob accepts this offer, we'll have a successful deal. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating, but with a slightly lower starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  While slightly better than his last offer, it's still a bit low for me.  
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, but I'm still hoping for a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation:**  We're getting closer. I'm going to counter again, hoping to reach a price that's agreeable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  I'm lowering my price to $10,800, coming closer to Bob's offer of $10,750. This shows I'm serious about making a deal and that we're approaching a possible agreement.
* **Small increment:**  The $100 difference between my counteroffer and Bob's last offer isn't a huge amount, so it might be more tempting for Bob to accept.
* **Time pressure:**  We're already halfway through our rounds, so I need to be strategic with my offers to reach a deal.

Let's see if this counteroffer gets Bob to agree!"
