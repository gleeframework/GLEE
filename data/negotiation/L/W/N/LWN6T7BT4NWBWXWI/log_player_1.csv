"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to the product's value to Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,500. This is a compromise that still leaves some room for negotiation, but is also closer to my desired price. I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is a lot closer to my minimum than selling to John, I'm still going to reject this offer and counteroffer. I think I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
``` 

I'm offering $9,200 this time. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price. I think this is a fair offer, considering the value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my desired price, it seems like Bob is not willing to go higher. Considering the time constraint and the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum, I will choose to sell the product to John for $8,000."
