"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,400,000.  He has room to negotiate and should aim to get closer to Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price quickly. $1,200,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, but still well above Alice's minimum value. This aggressive move is likely to either force Alice to negotiate seriously or signal that she might not be willing to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try to get a lower price.  The risk of buying from John is still higher than the potential reward of continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still trying to save money.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable middle ground,  keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is getting closer to Bob's desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's risky.  The risk of buying from John is higher than the potential reward of a slightly lower price from Alice.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget."
