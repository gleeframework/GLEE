I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a decent margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly, or simply move on to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I can potentially get more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and while it's lower than what I initially wanted, it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'll take it!"
