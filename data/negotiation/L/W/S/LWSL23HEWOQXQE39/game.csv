"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $8000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we discuss a price of $8500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $8500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit further. How about we settle on $7500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to bring the price down, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about we try $8100? It's a small step back from our previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  $8100 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $7800?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",7800.0,Bob,6,
