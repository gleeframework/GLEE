"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but you can likely do better.**  $8,000 is a good starting point, but you're aiming to save as much as possible.
* **You have 10 rounds.** You have ample time to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further.
* **John's offer is your safety net.**  Knowing you have a fallback option at $10,000 gives you more negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we discuss a price of $8500? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to be flexible. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, but there's still room for improvement.** $8,500 is better than $8,000, but you want to save as much as possible.
* **You have 7 rounds remaining.** You're still early in the negotiation and have time to continue pushing for a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  You can always fall back on buying from John if you don't reach a favorable deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit further. How about we settle on $7,500?  I think that's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to bring the price down, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about we try $8100? It's a small step back from our previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but you can still push.**  $8,100 is getting close to your ideal price, but you're still aiming for a lower price.
* **You have 5 rounds remaining.** You have some time left to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further.
* **John's offer is your backup plan.** You have a reliable option at $10,000 if the negotiation with Alice falls apart. 

You're in a good position to push for a lower price.  You've shown you're willing to negotiate and are willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still not quite there.  $8,100 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $7,800?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about we try $8000? It's a small step back from our previous offer, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as her initial offer in Round 1.**  This suggests she might be unwilling to go lower.
* **You have 3 rounds remaining.** You're running out of time to negotiate further.
* **John's offer is a backup plan, but it's not ideal.**  You can buy from John for $10,000, but that's the full price and you'd be missing out on the potential savings.

It's a gamble, but accepting Alice's offer at $8,000 is the most likely way to secure the product at a price lower than John's. You've already shown your negotiating skills and pushed for a lower price, so you're in a good position to accept this offer and save $2,000."
