"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something valuable at a price that's still beneficial to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other buyers lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $900,000 to Alice, saving $100,000 compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. 
* **Even though Alice values the product at $800,000, you're still getting a good deal.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so getting it for $900,000 is a good outcome."
