"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value to me, and allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to come down a bit and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This price is still significantly lower than my initial offer and provides a fair margin for both of us. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair return, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. I'm offering $950,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
