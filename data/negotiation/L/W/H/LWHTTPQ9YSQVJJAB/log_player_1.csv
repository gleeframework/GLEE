Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor point.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential return"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals that you're open to discussion and potential adjustments.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you might need to slightly lower your price to reach a deal. However, always remember your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
