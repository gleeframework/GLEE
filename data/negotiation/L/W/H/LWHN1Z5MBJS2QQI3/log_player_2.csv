"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
You're willing to pay up to $8,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to make this deal happen.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's latest offer is still higher than your maximum of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for your target price, it makes the most sense to buy from John."
