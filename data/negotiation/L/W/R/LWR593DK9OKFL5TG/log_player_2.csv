"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, I estimate its value to be well above $12000. However, to facilitate a transaction and explore mutual benefits, I am offering it to you at an exclusive introductory price of $15000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider this opportunity carefully. If you're interested, we can schedule a demonstration to showcase the product's capabilities and discuss how it might fit into your needs. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $15,000 for the product. The product's value is estimated to be above $12,000, but I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I'll reject Alice's offer and consider buying the product from John for $8,000.
