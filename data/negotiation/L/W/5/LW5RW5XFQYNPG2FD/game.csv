"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. The product is worth considerably more to me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? This still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",9500.0,Alice,3,
