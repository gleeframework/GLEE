"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still less than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm not desperate to sell. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1350000. I hope this offers a compromise that suits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can secure a better deal.  I'm also considering the risk of delaying the sale and potentially losing out to John. I have 6 rounds left, so I have some room to keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. Given our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1360000. I believe this strikes a balance between respecting the value of your product and adhering to my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is getting closer to my target price and represents a significant improvement over his previous offers. While I'm not thrilled about it being slightly less than my last counteroffer, I'm concerned about running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a good price without risking losing out to John."
