"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John wants $15,000. 
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to spend up to $15,000, so $12,000 is acceptable. 

Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $3,000."
