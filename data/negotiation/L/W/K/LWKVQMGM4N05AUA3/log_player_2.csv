"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This price is still well above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer of $12,000, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer of $10,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a small price reduction."
