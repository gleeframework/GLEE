"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $9,000, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $10,000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more, so I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say $11,500 is your final offer, but I have to be honest, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  If you're willing to come down to $10,500, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price for your budget. However, I've already come down from $12,000 to $11,500, and now you're asking me to go down another $1,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? It's a fair offer and gets us both closer to our desired outcomes.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,9,
