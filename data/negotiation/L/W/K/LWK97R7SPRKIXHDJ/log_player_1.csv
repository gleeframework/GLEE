Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for the next 24 hours.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I aim for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** $925,000 is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but well above my minimum. This gives Bob a sense of getting a deal while maximizing my potential profit.
* **Time Constraint:** Adding a 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to decide promptly."
