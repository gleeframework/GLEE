Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the value of the product might make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone remains open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be strategic.  
* **Market Demand:** If the product was in high demand and you knew Bob was very interested, you could potentially push the initial price even higher. 

This first offer is a starting point. How you adjust your strategy will depend on Bob's response."
