"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is still a good price considering the value you place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - $14,500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,
