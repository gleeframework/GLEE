"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

I'm aiming for a quick win, but if Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to move further. 
* **Time on my side:** I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, so I can afford to be a little more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $9,500 is a good price, but I'm hoping for a little more.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,750. It's still a great value for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a compromise to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining my profit:**  $9,750 is still significantly higher than my minimum, giving me a decent profit. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect of the deal to make it more appealing to Bob."
