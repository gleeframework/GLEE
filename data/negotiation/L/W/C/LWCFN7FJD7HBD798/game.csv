"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be highly beneficial for your operations. I'm confident you'll see the same value I do.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to be more competitive with my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a higher offer to consider selling. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and a fair reflection of the value you'll gain. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued engagement and willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us, but I need to see a stronger offer to consider selling. Let's aim for $825,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer $795,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $795,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and move closer to your offer, but I need to see a bit more to make this deal work.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,7,
