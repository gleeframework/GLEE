"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. To be honest, my budget for this product is closer to $12,000. If you're able to work with that, I think we can make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being straightforward about your budget.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $15,000 is still a stretch for me. I can make one final offer of $13,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
