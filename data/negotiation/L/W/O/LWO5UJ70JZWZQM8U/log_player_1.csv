Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $15,000 is still a stretch for me. I can make one final offer of $13,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:  Bob has consistently shown he's unwilling to meet even the lowest acceptable price of $15,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
