"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's much higher than both my budget and John's offer. I need to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a very low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives me the most room to move upwards during the negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a low number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving significant room to negotiate upwards towards my actual budget limit, but I don't want to reveal that limit just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that $200 is a bit high, so I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $130 is better than $200, it's still significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move her price down suggests there's room for further negotiation. I need to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $130 is still a bit higher than I had in mind.  Could you do any better on the price, maybe closer to $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only slightly, to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a significantly lower price. 
* **Nearing Budget:** $75 is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still leaving some room in case Alice is willing to negotiate further. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By suggesting a price closer to my limit, I'm trying to gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $75 is just too low for me. I could consider letting it go for $100. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by claiming this is her final offer. It's designed to put pressure on me, but it doesn't necessarily mean she won't negotiate further. 
* **Still Above Budget:** $100 is still above my budget and significantly more than John's offer.
* **One Last Push:**  I'll try one last time to see if I can get closer to my target price. If Alice doesn't budge, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I could stretch to $80, but that's absolutely the highest I can go.  It's a great product and I'd be happy to take it off your hands at that price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm matching Alice's ""final offer"" tactic by presenting my own.  This creates a sense of urgency and a clear decision point.
* **Budget Limit:** I'm sticking to my absolute maximum budget of $80.  This reinforces my position and prevents me from overspending.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the benefits to Alice (selling the product quickly and easily). 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm prepared to buy from John.  Sticking to my budget is the priority."
