"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable item that will bring you great benefits. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds remaining, so you have time to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems interesting, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, given my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm still willing to negotiate further. There are 7 rounds remaining, so there's still time to see if we can reach an agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. Let's see if we can close the deal here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm willing to consider further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. While we've been negotiating and there are 5 rounds remaining, we seem to be hitting a stalemate.  I'm confident that I can get the product from John for $10,000, which is a better deal for me than continuing to negotiate with Alice.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
