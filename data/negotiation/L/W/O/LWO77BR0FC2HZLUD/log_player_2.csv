"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000) but still within Bob's budget. 
* However, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  He has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* This offer is a significant improvement over Alice's initial offer of $10,000, and it represents a good compromise. 
* While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject further counteroffers or that he might end up buying from John at a higher price.  
* Accepting the offer is the most rational choice given the current situation."
