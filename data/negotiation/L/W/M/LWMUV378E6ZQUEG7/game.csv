"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within a certain budget, Bob. However, I've done some research and found that similar products are selling for upwards of $22000. Considering the unique features and value this product offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept at this time.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $16500 is a fair price for this product. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm thinking of $17250. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",17250.0,Alice,5,
