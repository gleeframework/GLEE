Let's try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105, and it's a reasonable price compared to John's offer. Accepting now guarantees the best deal we can likely get."
