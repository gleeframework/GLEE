"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
