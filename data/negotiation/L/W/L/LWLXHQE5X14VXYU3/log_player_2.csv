Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $875,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still allowing you a considerable profit margin.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. While I want to find a solution, I need a price that reflects the product's true worth. My final offer is $825,000.  This is a firm offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll need to pursue other options.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While there might be a slight chance of getting the price lower, the risk of her walking away is high. Accepting at $825,000 still nets a good saving compared to John's offer."
