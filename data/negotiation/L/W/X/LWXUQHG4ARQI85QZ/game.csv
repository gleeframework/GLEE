"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired profit margin. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you placed on it, which is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, and I'm willing to go a little higher.  However, $950,000 is still out of my comfort zone.  I can offer $925,000 for the product. This is a significant step towards your last offer and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $955,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",955000.0,Alice,7,
