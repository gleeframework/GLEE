{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I want to avoid a situation where Bob immediately rejects my offer. By leaving some room, I can potentially work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not losing money if Bob rejects.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? I believe it would still be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still above what I'm willing to accept right now.  
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go higher. 
* **Protecting my value:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees my desired profit, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference at $95?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffering:**  I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my minimum value. 
* **Splitting the difference:** This approach shows I'm trying to find a compromise and makes it easier for Bob to say yes.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm not taking a loss. 
* **Positioning for a final deal:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter with $92 for the product. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our interests. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $92 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's a good deal for me, especially given the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's a chance Bob might reject my counteroffer, or that I won't be able to reach a better price. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit. 
* **No need to take a chance:**  Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but accepting Bob's offer is only slightly less profitable and avoids the hassle of finding another buyer."
