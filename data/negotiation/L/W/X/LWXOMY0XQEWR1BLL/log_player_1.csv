Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm happy to consider offers starting at $18,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer of $18,000. This is significantly higher than both my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""offers starting at,"" I signal that I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough to encourage Bob to engage in negotiations."
