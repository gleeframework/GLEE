"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets a high baseline and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the backup offer from John, so I need to be strategic but not overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my backup offer from John.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a better outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but not by much. I want to signal that I'm open to negotiation but still have a firm price in mind.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair price, and that he's more likely to accept it than to continue negotiating down further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my backup offer from John.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price. I'm not in a rush to sell, as I have John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that is more profitable than selling to John.  I'm hoping that Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate and will come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly the same as John's offer.  Since I have limited rounds, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
