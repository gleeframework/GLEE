Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a risky strategy, but it has the potential for the highest profit. 

**Here's the reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob values the product at more than $1,000,000, he's likely to accept.  
* **Worst Case Scenario:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell it to John for $800,000, guaranteeing a profit.

**Note:**  This strategy assumes that there's a chance Bob might value the product higher than $1,000,000. If I have no information about his potential valuation, this is a gamble."
