"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go.",14000.0,Alice,5,
