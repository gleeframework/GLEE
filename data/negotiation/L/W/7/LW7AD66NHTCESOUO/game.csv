,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12500 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $14000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is already a discount from my initial price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
