"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  It's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",14000.0,Bob,4,
