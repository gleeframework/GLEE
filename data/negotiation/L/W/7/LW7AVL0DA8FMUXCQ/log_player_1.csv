Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know you'll find great value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $130 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This offer is significantly higher than John's $100 offer, ensuring that selling to Bob remains the more profitable option."
