"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is $1,200,000 for you. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. However, if you choose to decline, I've already secured another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price of $1,500,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
