**Reasoning:** 

Alice has gone back up on her offer to $12,500. This indicates she is unlikely to budge much lower than her previous offers. With only a few rounds left and the risk of Alice continuing to hold firm, it's now safer to secure the product from John at $15,000.  While buying from Alice would be ideal, the potential savings are no longer worth the risk of the negotiation failing."
