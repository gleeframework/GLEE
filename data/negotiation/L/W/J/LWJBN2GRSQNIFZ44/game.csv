"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is more than my budget allows. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850000 at this time. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 850000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for 950000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is closer, but I'm still not there. My final offer is $975000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for 975000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1075000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
