"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum price is $12,000. It's unlikely Alice will immediately accept this offer, but it establishes Bob's firm limit and opens negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  While there are limited rounds left, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth continuing to see if Alice will budge closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already stated his absolute maximum price of $12,000. Now, he's increasing his offer slightly to $12,500, showing a willingness to compromise but still staying within a reasonable range. This might make Alice more inclined to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. With only 5 rounds remaining, the likelihood of Alice lowering her price enough to make it worthwhile for Bob is decreasing.  It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at his desired price, even if it means missing out on potentially getting a slightly better deal from Alice."
