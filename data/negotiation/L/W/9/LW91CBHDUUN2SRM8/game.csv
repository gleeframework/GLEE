"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the quick response. $10000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm very interested in this product and think we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! While I appreciate your interest,  $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $9250? It's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you consider $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
