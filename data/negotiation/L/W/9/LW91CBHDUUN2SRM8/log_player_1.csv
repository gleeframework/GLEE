Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the quick response. $10000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? I'm very interested in this product and think we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price than Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my goal.  I'm confident I can make a counteroffer that Bob will accept."
