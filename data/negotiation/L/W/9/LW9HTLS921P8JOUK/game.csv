"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
