""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and its value to you is undeniable. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still being attractive to Bob. He gains $150,000 in value ($800,000 - $950,000) if he accepts.
* **Sense of Exclusivity:** The language used suggests the value of the product and positions it as a unique opportunity. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal with Bob."
