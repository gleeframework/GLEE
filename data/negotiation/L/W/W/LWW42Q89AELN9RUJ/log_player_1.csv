Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This incentivizes him to consider the deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a ""fair"" price:**  It's a compromise between your value and Bob's value. 

By starting with this offer, you are positioning yourself for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
