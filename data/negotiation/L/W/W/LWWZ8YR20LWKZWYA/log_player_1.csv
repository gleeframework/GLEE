"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture as much of the potential value as possible.  However, I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to move closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my target price and is a good deal considering the risk of him rejecting further offers or running out of rounds.  It's better than selling to John at $8,000."
