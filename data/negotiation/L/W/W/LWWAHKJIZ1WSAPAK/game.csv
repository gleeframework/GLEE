"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your asking price.  Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
