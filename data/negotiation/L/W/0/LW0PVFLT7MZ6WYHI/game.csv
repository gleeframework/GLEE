"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity!  I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial offer is $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its potential will more than justify the price. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1350000,  which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
