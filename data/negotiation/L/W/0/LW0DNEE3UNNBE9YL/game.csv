"Alice,  $2000000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can't go higher than $800000.  This is my maximum offer. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're able to reach that price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm very interested in your product but  I'm only able to go up to $900000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest. While $900000 is still lower than what I need,  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1000000. If you're serious about acquiring this product, this is the best offer you'll get from me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  I'm going to have to decline your offer and explore other options.",0.0,Bob,6,
