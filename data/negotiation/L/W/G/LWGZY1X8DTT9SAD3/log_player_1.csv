Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price than Bob's offer.  $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate.  I'll see if I can get closer to $1,750,000."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,625,000. While it's a little less than I was hoping for, it's still a good deal and it's closer to my minimum than John's offer.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing too hard."
