Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value and potential""  provides a basis for the high price without revealing the product's true worth to you.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to discuss the price, which might make Bob more receptive. 

By starting high, you leave room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price that exceeds your minimum acceptable amount."
