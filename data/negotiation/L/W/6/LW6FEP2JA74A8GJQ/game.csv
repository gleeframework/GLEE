"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $115 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
