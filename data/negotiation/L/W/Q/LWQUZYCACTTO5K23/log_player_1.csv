Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,350,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is impossible:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's true valuation of $1,000,000. 
* **Aiming high, but leaving room:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the product's benefits and positioning the price as ""fair"" aims to make it more palatable to Bob.

**The Goal:** The ideal outcome is for Bob to accept this offer. If he negotiates down slightly, there's still a good chance of exceeding the $1,500,000 John offers. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. How Bob responds will determine the next move in the negotiation."
