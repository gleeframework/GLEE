{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal and a significant saving for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This will hopefully make Bob more likely to engage and start the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Would you be willing to consider $9500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I will reject his offer and try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $10500 for the product. I hope this offer aligns better with your pricing strategy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer."

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my desired price. It's better to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiations with Bob."
