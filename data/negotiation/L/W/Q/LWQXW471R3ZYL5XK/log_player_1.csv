Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for you. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John provides leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**The message is crafted to:**

* **Highlight exclusivity and value:**  This piques Bob's interest and justifies the high price.
* **Sound confident but not greedy:** A slightly softer approach than a bare-bones demand can encourage a positive response."
