Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's value is $100, there's no harm in starting with a price higher than your minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to surprisingly accept. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""limited time"" and ""value,""  you create a sense of urgency and worth. 
* **Above Guaranteed Sale:** The price of $175 is above your guaranteed sale price from John ($150). If Bob accepts, you earn more. If he rejects, you're no worse off. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  You could experiment with different opening offers and messages based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
