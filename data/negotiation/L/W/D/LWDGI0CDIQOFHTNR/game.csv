Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This would be a great price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $815000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
