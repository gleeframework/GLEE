"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I can't go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's worth it to me. Can we meet in the middle again?",920000.0,Bob,4,
