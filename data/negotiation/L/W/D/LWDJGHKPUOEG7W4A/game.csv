"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",11500.0,Alice,3,
