Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth even more than your asking price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price closer to $10,000 if needed, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
