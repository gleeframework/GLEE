"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
The offer of $150 is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves you room to negotiate upward while staying well below your $100 limit. Starting low increases the chance of securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $115 is still more than you're willing to pay and more than John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

This counteroffer shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while still staying under your $100 limit.  It's essential to strike a balance between trying to get a good deal and not being too aggressive with your counteroffers, which could make Alice walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met your maximum price! There's no point in continuing to negotiate since you can get the same price from John.  Accept the offer and get the product."
