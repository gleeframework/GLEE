Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000.  While this information is useful, we don't want to base our offer solely on this.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to earn as much as possible. Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, we should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also reinforces the idea that the product is highly valued.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, and we'll sell to John at $15,000. However, it maximizes our potential profit if Bob decides to accept or negotiate closer to our asking price."
