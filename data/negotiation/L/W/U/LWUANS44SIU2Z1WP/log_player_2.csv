"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth $8,000 to you, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay $11,000."
