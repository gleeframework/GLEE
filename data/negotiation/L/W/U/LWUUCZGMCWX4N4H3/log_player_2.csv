"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  You can likely get a better price.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 9 more rounds to try to get a lower price.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You have time to see if you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Keeps the door open:**  It's not a hard ""no"" and gives Alice space to counter without feeling completely shut down.
* **Keeps the focus on value:** The message emphasizes your desire for the product, positioning the price negotiation as a matter of finding the right value for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $10,500 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Value for time:**  You've saved $500 compared to John's offer, and you're only in round 3, so you've made progress quickly.
* **Risk vs. reward:** Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but it's a risk. You could end up losing time and potentially paying more."
