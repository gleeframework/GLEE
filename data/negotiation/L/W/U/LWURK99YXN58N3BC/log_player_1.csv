Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to $14,000, but I'm willing to compromise if necessary.  I'll keep John in mind as a backup buyer if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right away if you're okay with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired profit margin. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my target of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,750 is a reasonable compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and  it seems unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob. It's best to accept and move on."
