"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, given its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll see it's a good deal for you as well.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on $12,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. I'll offer it to you for $13,500, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $10,000.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $12,750. This price is still within your minimum price and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'll meet you at $14,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",14250.0,Alice,7,
