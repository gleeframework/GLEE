"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We believe it's a game-changer and would be a great addition to your portfolio. We're willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. We're confident that you'll find it worth the investment, and we're excited to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You can get the product from John for $1,200,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you taking the time to discuss the product.  While I see its potential, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. We believe this price is more in line with the product's value and would be a fair compromise. Let us know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're still better off buying from John at $1,200,000 than accepting Alice's offer at $1,350,000. You should reject and try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're willing to consider it, but we're not quite ready to accept $1,300,000. We're willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,320,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your interest in it. Let us know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but even at $1,320,000, it's still more expensive than buying from John for $1,200,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
