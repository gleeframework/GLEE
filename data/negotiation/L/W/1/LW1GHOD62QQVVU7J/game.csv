"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can work something out.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from $95. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  If you're serious about selling, I'm happy to offer you $100.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer it to you for $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're really interested, this is your last chance to make an offer.",105.0,Alice,7,
