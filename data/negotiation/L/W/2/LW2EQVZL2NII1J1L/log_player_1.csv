{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value for your business, and I'm confident it will bring you significant returns. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This reflects the product's high quality and potential.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can find a price that better aligns with my budget. My counteroffer is $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my minimum price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore further options."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product.

This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while allowing me to meet my own financial goals."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose this deal, especially since John is also offering the same price. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
