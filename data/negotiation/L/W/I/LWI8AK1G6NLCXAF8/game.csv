"I really like the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you halfway between $14,000 and $18,000, which is $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can we discuss further?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,250, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value I've already conceded. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,9,
