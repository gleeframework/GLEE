"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 and Alice's offer is exactly $15,000, there is no room for negotiation. It's better to buy the product from John immediately, as you know the price upfront and avoid any risk of further negotiations."
