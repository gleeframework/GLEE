Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still offer an attractive price to Bob.
* **Beat Bob's Value:**  Offering it slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) makes it more likely he'll see it as a good deal if he needs/wants the product.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer, starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above our minimum.

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects the offer, we have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at $150."
