Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $120. I know this is a bit of a stretch for him, but I want to see if he's willing to pay my value. If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price for me, considering Bob's initial value.  I hope he'll accept, but if not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
