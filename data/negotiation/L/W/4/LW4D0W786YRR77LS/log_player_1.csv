Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a lower price, or walk away to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, so I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 is a bit low for you, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for $140 or higher, accepting Bob's offer at $130 is still above my minimum of $150 and is a good compromise.  It's a win-win situation, as Bob gets the product and I still make a profit."
