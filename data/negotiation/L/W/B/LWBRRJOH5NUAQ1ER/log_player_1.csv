Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help you understand how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, you got lucky! If he rejects, it opens the door for a counter-offer or you can fall back on selling to John. 
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $150 gives you a strong position. You don't *need* to go below that price. 

**Important Note:**  While I suggested $175, you could experiment with different starting prices to see what works best in your negotiations."
