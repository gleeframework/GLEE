Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000** is a good compromise between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob still gets a good deal. 
* I'm offering a price that is less than what the product is worth to Bob, increasing the likelihood he will accept.
*  This price is also significantly higher than what I would get from John, ensuring I still make a substantial profit."
