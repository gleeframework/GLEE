"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **First round strategy:**  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Time to counter:**  Rejecting allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range, and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This price is still fair, considering the value you'll receive from the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's more in line with my minimum. 
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the worth of my counteroffer.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm being flexible, I'm not giving away too much in this early stage of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to counter with a price of $1,025,000. This is my final offer before considering purchasing the product from another source. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing deal:** If I reject, there's a risk Bob will actually buy from another source, and I'll be left with nothing.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and the deal with John is always an option, but I don't want to risk waiting too long. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids the potential of getting nothing if negotiations continue."
