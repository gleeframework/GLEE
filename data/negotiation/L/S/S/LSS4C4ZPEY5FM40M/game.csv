,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's potential significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway and reduce the price to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the product's potential, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which represents a substantial investment on my part. Let's find common ground to make this deal work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
