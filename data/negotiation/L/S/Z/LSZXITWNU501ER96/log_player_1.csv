Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high initially to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so starting near that figure makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, the price will likely remain well above your minimum of $10,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how eager he is to purchase the product."
