Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair starting point given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we are not there yet.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and we still have time and room to work with."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,550,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my budget limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While this is below our ideal price, Bob has signaled this is his final offer. It's a significant amount above his initial offer and exceeds our minimum acceptable price. It makes sense to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
