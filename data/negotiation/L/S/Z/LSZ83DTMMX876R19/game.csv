"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair starting point given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you placed on it and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet halfway â€“ how about $1,550,000? This offer reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair price for this valuable product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,550,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm approaching my budget limit.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
