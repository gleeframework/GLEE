``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm also willing to negotiate. It's a good strategy to start with a reasonable price that still leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I am only able to commit to a maximum of $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go lower than $875,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value, but still attractive to Bob. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to compromise a little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge, and I'm not confident I can get him to come up to my desired price.  It's not worth risking the negotiation further. I'm going to sell to John and get my desired price."
