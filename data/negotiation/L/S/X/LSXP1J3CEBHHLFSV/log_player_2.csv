"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction while staying within his budget. By offering $950,000, he's making a bold counteroffer that will likely trigger further negotiations. This strategy helps him secure a lower price while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer.  Bob can likely secure a better price by rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations. The next counteroffer could aim to push the price even lower, potentially getting it down to Bob's maximum acceptable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing his absolute maximum price. This move signals to Alice that he's serious about purchasing the product but will walk away if she doesn't accept. This tactic puts pressure on Alice to either agree or risk losing a potential sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer the product to you for $1075000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Even though she has made concessions, it's not enough to meet Bob's financial goal.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as this ensures he stays within his budget and gets the product."
