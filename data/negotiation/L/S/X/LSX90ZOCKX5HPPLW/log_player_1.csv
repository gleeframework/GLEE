{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency for Bob.  It's significantly less than my guaranteed sale price, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves a small window for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for me."
