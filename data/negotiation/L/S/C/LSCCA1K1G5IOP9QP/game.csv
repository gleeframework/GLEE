"I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $10,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $7,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,500 is close, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this. That's my firm offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet at $7,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $8,000.",7800.0,Bob,6,
