Bob's offer:

This demonstrates my strong interest in the product and my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $925,000 is a significant amount and very close to your $1,000,000 goal. Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time Factor:**  You're past the halfway point in negotiations. Bob is clearly interested but also has a budget ceiling. The longer this drags on, the higher the risk he walks away. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, closing a deal with Bob now avoids potential delays and uncertainties that could arise with a different buyer.

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accept the $925,000 and finalize the sale."
