"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. Given my research and the product's potential value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm eager to explore a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure, and I can't part with it for less than $975,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll see an excellent return on your investment.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my strong interest in the product and my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest, I need to be firm on my price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident this is a fair and reasonable price for a product of this caliber.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part.  This offer demonstrates my genuine desire to reach an agreement, and I hope we can find common ground at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
