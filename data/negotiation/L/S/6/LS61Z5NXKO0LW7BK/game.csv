"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but my budget is quite limited. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet halfway at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the quality and benefits.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $17,000. Would it be possible to negotiate further? Perhaps we could aim for $14,000? I believe this would still provide a good value for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
