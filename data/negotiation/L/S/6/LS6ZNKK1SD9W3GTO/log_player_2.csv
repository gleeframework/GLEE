"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is close to your limit, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step towards your desired price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're not afraid to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $135? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but she's still above your limit of $120.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, as you're still within your desired range and the product is worth $150 to Alice, suggesting further compromise is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested but $135 is still too high.  Let's meet in the middle at $130.  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous offer. It shows a willingness to work towards a deal while still keeping a bit of space for further negotiation."
