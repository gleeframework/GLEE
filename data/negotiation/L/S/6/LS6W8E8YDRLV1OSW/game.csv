"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the starting price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000.

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is a strong starting point, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $2,050,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us.",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.
