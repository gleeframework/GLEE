"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, knowing the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to try and entice him.
* **Leaving Room:**  I want to leave enough room for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step in the right direction, $10,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and leaves me with a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer further, especially since he indicated he's willing to pay a premium.
* **More Rounds:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate but also establish a clear minimum price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to acknowledge your willingness to pay a premium.  This price is still fair given the value the product holds for you. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's, but still significantly higher than his offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not giving in to his offer, but I'm showing flexibility and willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Setting a Clear Expectation:** I'm clearly stating my minimum price point, while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to see if I can get a better offer from Bob. 
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting there's still room for negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain a strong negotiating position and signal that I am committed to achieving a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 still isn't quite there for me.  Given your stated willingness to pay a premium for this product, I'm willing to go down to $11,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above $11,000.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this offer as a ""final compromise"" to signal that I'm close to my limit and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him to reinforce the fairness of the price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's crucial to start narrowing the gap. 

By offering $11,500, I'm striking a balance between pushing for a higher price and potentially losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $11,000, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $11,500.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Guarantee a Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and ensures a significant profit.

By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation and ensure a profitable outcome. While I would have liked to earn more, this decision secures a substantial profit within the remaining rounds."
