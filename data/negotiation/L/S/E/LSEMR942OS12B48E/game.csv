"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to acknowledge your willingness to pay a premium.  This price is still fair given the value the product holds for you. Let's find a middle ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Can you consider this offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 still isn't quite there for me.  Given your stated willingness to pay a premium for this product, I'm willing to go down to $11,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you. Let's finalize this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
