"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the price is still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower, potentially getting closer to his target of $100."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging from $110, and while this is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for $100, Bob is better off buying from John to stay within his budget."
