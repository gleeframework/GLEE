"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still a bit too high. Would you be willing to accept $108?  I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
