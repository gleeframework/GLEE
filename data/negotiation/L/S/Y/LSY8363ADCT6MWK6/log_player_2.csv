{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since Alice's first offer is significantly lower than your maximum.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Let's start by offering $1,000,000. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within our budget. It should be enough to show Alice we're serious about negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a very reasonable price.  While we could try to negotiate a little lower, we've already had a few rounds and we risk the deal falling apart.  Accepting the offer at $1,030,000 is a good deal and within our budget."
