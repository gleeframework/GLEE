"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  My starting price is $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **You're trying to save money.** While $100 is a good price, you can likely do better. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **You have a fallback option.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $120 gives you leverage. 

By rejecting the initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're not desperate and you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** A $20 drop is a significant counteroffer, showing Alice you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** ""I'm sure we can find a price..."" keeps the negotiation open and friendly.
* **Room to negotiate:** $80 is still below your $120 limit, leaving you with room to raise the price if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $90 is a good compromise, and it's closer to your preferred price.
* **Time is a factor:**  You're already in round 3, and you don't want to risk getting stuck with John's higher price.
* **Good deal:** $90 is still a good deal for you, saving you $30 compared to John. 

While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, accepting this offer is the most sensible move at this stage."
