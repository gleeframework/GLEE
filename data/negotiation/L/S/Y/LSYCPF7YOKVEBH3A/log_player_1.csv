"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  My starting price is $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum price of $80.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a higher price.
* **Positive opening:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to start the negotiation. This sets a good atmosphere for discussion.
* **Open ended question:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm inviting Bob to engage and potentially start the counter-offer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can encourage him to increase his counter-offer.  I have 8 rounds left and am confident I can find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $80 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground.  By offering $90, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial counter-offer. 
* **Emphasis on benefits:** I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to continue the negotiation."
