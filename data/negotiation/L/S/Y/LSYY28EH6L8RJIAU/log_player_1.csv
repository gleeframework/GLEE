Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I see its potential value.  However, your initial price is a bit above where I'm comfortable starting.  I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This leaves room for a good profit margin for you while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I need to make sure I'm getting a decent return. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
