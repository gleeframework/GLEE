Given its significance and the potential it holds for you, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this item for $1,200,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to purchase from John at your desired price point."
