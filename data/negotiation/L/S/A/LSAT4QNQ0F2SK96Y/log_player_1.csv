``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation space while still leaving a healthy profit margin for me.  It also acknowledges Bob's perceived value of the product, making it more likely he'll engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget that doesn't allow for such a high expenditure. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of your product and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still not satisfied with it. I believe I can potentially get a higher price through further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I am still working within a strict budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000. This price aims to strike a balance between respecting the product's value and staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the negotiations are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept $1,060,000, but I'm not willing to go lower. Given the risk of further negotiation not yielding a higher price and John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000, I'll choose to sell the product to John."
