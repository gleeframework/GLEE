"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product further. However, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still getting a better deal from John, and you can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice. It's worth trying to go another round and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This seems like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $875,000. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, and you only have five rounds left.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a better price from Alice, and buying from John is still more expensive.  Accepting this offer will save you $115,000 compared to buying from John."
