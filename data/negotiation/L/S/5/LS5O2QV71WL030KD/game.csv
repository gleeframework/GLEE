"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product further. However, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This seems like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $875,000. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
