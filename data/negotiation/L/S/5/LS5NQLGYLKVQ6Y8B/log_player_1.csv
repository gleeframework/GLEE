"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message creates a better atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** By setting a price slightly higher than my minimum, I allow Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100 and below the product's worth to Bob ($80). 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is interested in the product, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:**  I have John as a safety net, so I can afford to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing the value for both of us. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I'm getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Potential for loss:**  If I reject his offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll have to sell to John for $100. 
* **Time constraint:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting now ensures a sale and prevents further potential delays."
