"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a high price ($100) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can negotiate down from there. It's important to remember that I have a safety net with John, so I don't have to settle for a price lower than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
