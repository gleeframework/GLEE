"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $975,000? I feel that's a fair offer, splitting the difference between our previous positions."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Alice is inching down slowly, and we're running out of rounds. It's unlikely she'll go as low as John's $1,000,000 offer, so it's best to cut our losses and buy from John now."
