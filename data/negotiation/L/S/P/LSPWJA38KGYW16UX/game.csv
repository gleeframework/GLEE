"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $975,000? I feel that's a fair offer, splitting the difference between our previous positions.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,075,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
