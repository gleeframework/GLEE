Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $95? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly trying to come down to a fair price, and $92 is a decent compromise.  It's getting close enough to John's price that it's not worth risking further negotiation."
