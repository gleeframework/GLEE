"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's incredibly fair, considering its value. I'm sure you'll find it to be a great deal. Let's discuss the details and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $15,000.  You have room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price."
