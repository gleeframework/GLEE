"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit below my minimum. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1200000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $1150000, but that's as low as I can go.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1100000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet there, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
