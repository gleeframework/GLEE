"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000.  I'm confident you'll see its worth.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I can consider. How about we meet in the middle?  Would you be willing to go up to $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,750? This offer reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the updated offer.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but $8,750 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $7,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering I'm willing to move up on my initial offer. ",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to make my final offer to try and close this deal.  Would you consider $8,250?  This is the lowest I can go and still feel like I'm getting a fair deal.",8250.0,Alice,7,
