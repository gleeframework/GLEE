"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2,300,000 is far too high for me. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $2,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
