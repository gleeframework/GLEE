Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?
