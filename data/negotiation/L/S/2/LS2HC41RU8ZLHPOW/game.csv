"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product is worth significantly more to me.  I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,4,
