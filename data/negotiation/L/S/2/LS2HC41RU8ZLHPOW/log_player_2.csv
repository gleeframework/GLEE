"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the product is worth significantly more to me.  I could consider letting it go for $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $19,000 is still above my budget, but closer to my target price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get her to come down further.  There are still many rounds left, and I can always choose to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
