The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $14,000. This means there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice is only willing to come down $500 from her original offer. It's still worth trying to get a lower price.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target price."

Alice is unwilling to budge on the price.  While $14,000 is still better than $15,000, it's not a significant enough savings to justify further negotiation.  It's better to buy from John and avoid any more potential negotiation rounds with Alice."
