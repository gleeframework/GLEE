"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation, and he'll likely counteroffer.  I'm also highlighting the potential value to him to encourage him to engage.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is more than what Bob initially valued the product at, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round to try and close the gap.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, acknowledging your interest in the product. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 
 
I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm emphasizing his interest to motivate him to consider this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,450,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting close.  How about $1,550,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, and a fair price considering the value this product brings you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  It's time to secure the guaranteed deal with John for $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to risk losing that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
