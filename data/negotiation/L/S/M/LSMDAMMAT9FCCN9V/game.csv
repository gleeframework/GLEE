"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to sell for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're not willing to go as low as $1,400,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, which would be $1,500,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
