Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price closer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to sell for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go as low as $1,400,000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, which would be $1,500,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with John's offer.  There's no need to risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on this deal."
