"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise,  as it's closer to my budget while still acknowledging the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
