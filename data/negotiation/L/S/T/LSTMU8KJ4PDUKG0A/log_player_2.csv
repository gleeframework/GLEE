"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $110 is still above your maximum budget of $100.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $105?  That's a good compromise and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $115. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $100, as further negotiation with Alice may not lead to a price within Bob's budget, and time is running out."
