"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $105?  That's a good compromise and allows me to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $115. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
