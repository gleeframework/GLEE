"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value I'm offering is fair. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my maximum offer, and I believe it reflects the product's fair value. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still represents a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is unfortunately not viable for me.  To move forward, I'd need to see an offer closer to $1500000. How about $1400000? This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a reasonable price for the product's value.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go to $1300000. This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 isn't quite working for me.  To finalize this deal, I'd need to see an offer closer to $1400000.  How about $1350000? This is a fair price for the product's value, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1325000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to accept that price, I'll have to move forward with my other options. I believe this is a fair compromise and we can both benefit from closing the deal.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To reach an agreement, I need to see a price closer to $1350000. How about $1340000? This is a small adjustment from your offer and a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",1340000.0,Alice,9,
