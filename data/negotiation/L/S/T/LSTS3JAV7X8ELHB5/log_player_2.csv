Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1250000 is unfortunately not viable for me.  To move forward, I'd need to see an offer closer to $1500000. How about $1400000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 isn't quite working for me.  To finalize this deal, I'd need to see an offer closer to $1400000.  How about $1350000? This is a fair price for the product's value, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
