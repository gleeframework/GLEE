Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. Therefore, any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, pushing my profit closer to the maximum. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  While not giving away my bottom line, I frame the price as ""fair,"" subtly implying it's a good deal for Bob.

By setting this initial offer, I aim to secure the best possible outcome in the negotiation with Bob."
