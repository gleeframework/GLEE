"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what the market typically offers. Considering its true value and your potential benefit, I propose to sell it to you for $120. This price not only reflects its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to save compared to what others might pay. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal. John's price of $150 sets a benchmark â€“ you know you won't have to pay more than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price or see if she'll come down to be more competitive with John."
