"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
