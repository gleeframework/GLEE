"Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the product's value, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. Considering the value I know this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the significant benefits you'll gain, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This price acknowledges the unique value this product brings to you while remaining within a reasonable range.  Let's aim for a final agreement in this round.",820000.0,Alice,5,
