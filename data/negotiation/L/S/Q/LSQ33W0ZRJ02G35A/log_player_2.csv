"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, ideally under $8,000.
* Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."

I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to get the product for under $8,000.
* Alice's final offer of $10,200 is still above Bob's ideal price point, even though she's shown some flexibility. 
* Since Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $8,000, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice, as the potential savings are not worth the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer."
