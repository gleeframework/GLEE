Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $19,000 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate, even if it's initially above his valuation.
* **Loss Aversion:** By presenting the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you might trigger a sense of potential loss in Bob if he declines. 

**Important:**  While John provides a safety net, it's always possible to find other buyers. Aim high, but be prepared to adjust your offer if Bob shows resistance."
