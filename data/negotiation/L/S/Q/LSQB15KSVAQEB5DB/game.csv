"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Given the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, so my counteroffer is $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $940,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects a significant compromise on my part.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I urge you to consider this offer.  Let's finalize this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
