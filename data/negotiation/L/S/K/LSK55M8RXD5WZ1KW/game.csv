"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $10,750 just isn't quite enough for me. How about we compromise at $10,900? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $10,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",10750.0,Bob,6,
