"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's estimated value. This aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum willingness to pay as possible.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This initial offer will reveal if Bob is truly serious about buying at a price close to his perceived value. 

If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer in subsequent rounds.  I'm also keeping in mind the safety net of selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a decent price, it's still below my ideal profit margin. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate.  

I'll use the next round to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our current positions. I'll aim for a price closer to $13,500,  leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. It shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal value. 

If Bob accepts, I'll achieve a good profit. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating, and I'll consider adjusting my offers based on his responses. The option to sell to John for $10,000 remains a backup plan if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the profit. I believe Bob is willing to pay a bit more, especially considering he's already rejected my counteroffer in the previous round. I'll use this round to send a final counteroffer that reflects my willingness to compromise while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $12,750 as my final counteroffer. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer of $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a more favorable price. 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While not ideal, $12,750 is significantly better than the $12,000 Bob offered.
* **Signal seriousness:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm ready to close the deal but won't settle for an extremely low price.
* **Consider the time constraint:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring a successful deal. 

If Bob accepts, I'll have achieved a reasonable profit. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options in the remaining rounds, including the possibility of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although $11,500 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I'm still hesitant to accept it. This is because:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's possible that he's willing to go a little higher, especially with only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Time pressure:** While time is running out, I still have a few rounds to try and get a better price. 

I'll use this round to send a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground, aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider selling to John in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $12,000 as my counteroffer in this round. This is a compromise, higher than Bob's last offer of $11,500 but lower than my previous offer of $12,750. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:** This offer shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Signal seriousness:**  It demonstrates a commitment to closing the deal while still trying to achieve a reasonable profit.
* **Consider time constraints:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to make a move that could potentially lead to a successful deal.

If Bob accepts, I'll achieve a decent profit. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully evaluate my options in the next two rounds.  The possibility of selling to John for $10,000 is still on the table if a successful deal with Bob doesn't materialize."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a difficult decision, but with only two rounds remaining, I believe it's best to sell to John. Here's why:

* **Bob's stubbornness:** Bob has continuously rejected offers close to his perceived value, suggesting he's unwilling to budge significantly. 
* **Time pressure:** With only two rounds left, there isn't enough time to negotiate a better deal with Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit:** While $10,000 is not my ideal price, it's still a secure profit that exceeds my minimum requirement and ensures I don't lose money. 

Selling to John guarantees a quick and safe transaction, leaving me with a decent profit.  It's a better strategy than risking further negotiation with Bob, especially with the limited time available."
