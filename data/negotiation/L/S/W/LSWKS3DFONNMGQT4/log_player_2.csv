"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
