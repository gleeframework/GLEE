Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and land at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $10,750 is a solid deal. It exceeds my minimum by a decent margin and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
