"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $900,000. Would you be open to negotiating around that figure?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your target price is $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I hope this counteroffer is a step in the right direction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I'm considering another offer at $1,000,000.  Could you meet that price? If so, we have a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're considering another offer, but I'm not willing to meet it at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,075,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable, but if not, I'm prepared to move on.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
