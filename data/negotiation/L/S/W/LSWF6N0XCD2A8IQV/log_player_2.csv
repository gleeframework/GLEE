"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000 from John, there's room for negotiation. You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  This indicates a potential for a deal closer to your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts by making a significant move towards Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000).  By offering $10,000, you're showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good amount of potential savings.  This creates a starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $15,000, and it's likely that further negotiation might not yield a much lower price. Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a price that's within your budget and a good deal."
