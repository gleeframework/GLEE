Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (John's price), there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.  Our offer should be significantly above this to be attractive to us but below his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency and Competition:**  Mentioning another interested party (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to accept a higher price. 

**The offered price of $1,100,000:**

* **Profitable for Alice:**  Significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potentially Acceptable to Bob:**  Leaves room for Bob to still make a profit if the product's value to him is realized."
