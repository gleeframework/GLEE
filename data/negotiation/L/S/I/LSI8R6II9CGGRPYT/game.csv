"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's in excellent condition and you know it's worth at least $150 to you. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to save a bit of money if possible.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about $140? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. Can you consider that?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference. $137.50 is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying it, this is the best I can do. ",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close, but I'm still not comfortable with $137.50. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take the deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
