"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1050000. This price still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
