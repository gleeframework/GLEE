"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's discuss the price. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to make a serious offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to know you're serious about the deal. This is my final offer for now, and I'm counting on your response.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
