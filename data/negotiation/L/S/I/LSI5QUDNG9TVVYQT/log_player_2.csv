"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's discuss the price. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to make a serious offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This price is fair and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need to know you're serious about the deal. This is my final offer for now, and I'm counting on your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  I've already spent several rounds and it's unclear if we'll reach an agreement before the deadline. I've established a solid baseline with John, so it's best to secure the product at his price and move on."
