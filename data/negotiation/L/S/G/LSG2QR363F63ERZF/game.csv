"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $25000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer of $10000. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident this product is worth $10000 to me, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and go with $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $18000, which would be $16000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
