"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,100,000.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth more than $900,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the sale.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $975,000. I think this is a more reasonable offer, considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Alice,5,
