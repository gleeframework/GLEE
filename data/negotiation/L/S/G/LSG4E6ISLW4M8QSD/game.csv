"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I appreciate you coming down in your offer. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident it's a price that's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
