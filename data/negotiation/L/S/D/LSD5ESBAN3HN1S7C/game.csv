"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,600,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you won't find this kind of value elsewhere. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
