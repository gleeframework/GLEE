Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but gives Bob some room to negotiate. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price without losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I'm not going to sell to John just yet, as I think I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a price closer to my desired amount."
