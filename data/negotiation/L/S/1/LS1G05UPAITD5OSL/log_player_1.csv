Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had from others, I'm proposing a price of $17,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at other interested parties and emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $17,000, the wording suggests there might be some flexibility, potentially leading to a price Bob finds acceptable above your minimum.

**Goal:** The aim is to secure a deal with Bob at a price exceeding your $15,000 minimum, maximizing your profit."
