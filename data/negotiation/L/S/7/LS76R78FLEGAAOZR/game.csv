,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $9,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'd be willing to go up to $7,000.  Do you think that would work?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,000. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers, at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
