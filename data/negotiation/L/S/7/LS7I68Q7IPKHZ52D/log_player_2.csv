"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $100?  That's a fair price considering the value."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his maximum budget and is also a reasonable discount from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit higher.  How about $110?  That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and pushing the price higher exists.  At this point, accepting the offer is the safest option to ensure Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
