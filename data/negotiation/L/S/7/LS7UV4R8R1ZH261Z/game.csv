"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we settle at $950,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000 was a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to go slightly lower. I can sell it to you for $1,025,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to finalize a deal, but  I can't go any higher than $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
