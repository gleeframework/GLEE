It's not worth paying Alice's asking price.  You can get the product for a better price from John.  It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can get her to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product, which is what I can get it for from John.  Hopefully, she'll accept it, but if not, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

``` 
Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, so it's worth accepting and avoiding further negotiation."
