"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a decent price while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm using the knowledge of Bob's value for the product to set a price that's likely to be accepted but also beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we settle on $97.50? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $97.5 is a good price, I'm still within my goal of getting more than $80.  I'm confident I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob, as he's already shown his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to go down to $101.25 for this exceptional product. This is my final offer before I have to consider other buyers."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we make this the final deal and split the difference one last time at $99.37? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99.37. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99.37
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$99.37 is very close to my previous offer of $101.25, and it's definitely a better price than selling to John.  At this point, with only four rounds left, it's more beneficial to close the deal and secure a good profit.  There's always a risk of Bob backing out completely in the remaining rounds, so it's wise to accept a fair offer now."
