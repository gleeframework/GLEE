"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you and it will allow me to get a good return on my investment.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value of the product to me and your investment, I would like to propose a price of $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,175,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I still feel that $1,175,000 is a bit high for me. I would like to propose a price of $1,160,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while also allowing you a reasonable return. I hope you'll find this offer acceptable.",1160000.0,Bob,4,
