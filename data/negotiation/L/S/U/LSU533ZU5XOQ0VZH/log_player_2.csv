Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your decisiveness, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I've already mentioned that I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $850,000 one more time. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least this price to make it worthwhile for me.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer and has now repeated a previous price. This indicates she's unlikely to budge much further.  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's becoming clear that getting her much lower is unlikely.  To avoid the risk of the negotiation completely falling apart and ending up with nothing, it's strategically safer to cut losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
