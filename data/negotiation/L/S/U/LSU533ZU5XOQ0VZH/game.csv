"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I agree this product has value, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle, perhaps around $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $775,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we both have our limits.  $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $800,000?  I'm willing to be decisive at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your decisiveness, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I've already mentioned that I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $850,000 one more time. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least this price to make it worthwhile for me.",850000.0,Alice,7,
