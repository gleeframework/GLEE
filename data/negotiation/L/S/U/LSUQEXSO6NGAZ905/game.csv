"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair price and would allow me to make this purchase comfortably.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $13,000 is a comfortable price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $13,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,
