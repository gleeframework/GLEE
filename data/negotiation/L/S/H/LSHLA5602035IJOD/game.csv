"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the product's value and our mutual desire for a successful transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.  How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
