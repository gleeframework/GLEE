"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a more competitive price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the product's value and our mutual desire for a successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.  How about $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. This price is still lower than what Bob would pay from John and closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a better price than John and ends the negotiation process."
