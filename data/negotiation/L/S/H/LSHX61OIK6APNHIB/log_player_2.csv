"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming for a price below $8,000 and there's room for negotiation. You can counteroffer with a lower price and see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This price is still reasonable considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your target, you can still try to get a lower price.  Since John is offering the product for $8,000, you have a solid benchmark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm confident that $8,750 is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Would you be willing to accept this offer?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8750 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $8875 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and our ongoing negotiations. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to your target, you can still push for a lower price. You're already close to your ideal price from John, and there's no need to rush into a deal at this point. You still have five rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,875 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $8,700 for the product. This represents a fair price that respects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8700}
