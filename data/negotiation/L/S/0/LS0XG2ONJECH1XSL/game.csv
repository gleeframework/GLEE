"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After reviewing your profile, I believe you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up this opportunity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'd like to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price given the value to me, and I'm ready to close the deal quickly.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your interest in the product and the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price given the value to me and allows you to make a profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $815,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for both parties.",815000.0,Alice,5,
