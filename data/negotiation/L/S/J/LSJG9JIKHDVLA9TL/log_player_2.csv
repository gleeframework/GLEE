"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $120 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to meet somewhere in the middle of the remaining price range. It shows I'm interested but want a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's counter again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see where you're coming from, Alice. How about we split the difference and say $97.50? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

We're getting into the later rounds, so offering a straight split of the difference might be a good way to signal I'm serious but still want a good deal."
