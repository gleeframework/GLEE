"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?  It's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
