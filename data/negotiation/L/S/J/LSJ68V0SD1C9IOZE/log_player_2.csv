"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get the price lower by making a counteroffer.  It's always worth exploring options to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay closer to $1,000,000, but I need to make a reasonable profit as well.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is my lowest offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While it's still more than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a good deal.  There's always a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer and Bob will be forced to buy from John, so it's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a lower price."
