{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is higher than $100, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still above your minimum of $120, leaving room for you to make concessions if necessary. 
* **It shows a willingness to negotiate:** This offer demonstrates you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
