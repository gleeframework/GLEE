"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $9,000 when you can get it from John for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of your budget. It also gives you room to negotiate further if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a final attempt to meet Alice's price point while staying within your budget. Since John is offering the same price, this counteroffer has the highest chance of success without risking going over your budget."
