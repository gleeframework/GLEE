,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1050000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1150000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1100000, which would be a fair compromise.  This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm thinking of a price of $1080000. It's a fair price that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
