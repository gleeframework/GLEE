# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  You can reject Alice's offer and still get the product at your maximum price point."
