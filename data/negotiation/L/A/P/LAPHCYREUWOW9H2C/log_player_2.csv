Let's start with a significant counteroffer.  $1,000,000 is a big jump from Alice's initial offer, but it shows our serious intent to negotiate. It's also a price that still allows us to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."

Alice is still too high, but we're getting closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as we're still significantly below John's price.  Let's see if we can get her to budge a little more."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're running out of time, and Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price. It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid any more risk of Alice rejecting our final offer.  We've come close to a good deal, but time is a factor."
