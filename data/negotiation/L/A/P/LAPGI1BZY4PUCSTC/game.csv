"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I can't consider a price higher than $800000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. While $1100000 is closer to what I can afford, I still need to stay within my maximum limit of $800000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm prepared to go down to $1050000. This is a significant compromise, and it's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
