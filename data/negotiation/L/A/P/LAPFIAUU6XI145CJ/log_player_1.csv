Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand the value of the product, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. I hope you'll consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's offer, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
