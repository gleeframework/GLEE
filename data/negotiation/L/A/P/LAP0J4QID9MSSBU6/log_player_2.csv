"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price. There's room for negotiation, and Bob has a solid fallback option with John. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still within the range of Bob's budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, and there's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further to secure a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,700 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still not a great deal. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation. While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's not worth the risk of potentially getting stuck with a higher price."
