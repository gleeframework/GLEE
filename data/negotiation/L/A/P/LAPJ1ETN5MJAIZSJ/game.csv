,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
