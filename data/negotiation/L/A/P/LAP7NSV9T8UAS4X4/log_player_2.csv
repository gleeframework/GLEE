"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it's a great investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make a profit, $900,000 is still significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Accepting this offer saves you $300,000."
