"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $110 is the best deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $100, so I'm offering $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $115.

"I'm really close to my budget, and I'm not sure if I can go any higher. I'll meet you at $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that?",110.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for less than $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $114. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",114.0,Alice,7,
