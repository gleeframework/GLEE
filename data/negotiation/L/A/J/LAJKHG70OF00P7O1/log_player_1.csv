{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a little."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? That would allow me to sell the product and still be happy with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close, but I'd rather not pay the full $100. How about $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is getting very close to my minimum price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's better to be safe than sorry, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
