"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate the offer, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to stay above $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $9,100. This is my final offer - let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,150. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal!",9150.0,Alice,7,
