"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Bob's initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, demonstrating his desire to negotiate a good price.
* **Reasonable amount:** $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still higher than what Bob would pay John. This leaves room for negotiation without making the offer completely unreasonable.
* **Clear communication:**  The message highlights Bob's interest in the product while making it clear he's not willing to meet Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's limit, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his target of $8,000. There are still rounds left, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  While I appreciate the offer, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget.
* **Compromise language:** The message emphasizes ""compromise"" to encourage Alice to meet halfway.
* **Reasoning:**  Bob explains why this price is a good option for both parties, making the counteroffer more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to stay above $9,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is getting closer to Bob's target, there are still a few rounds left and he can try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer one last time and potentially reach an agreement closer to $9,000. There's still a possibility that Alice will accept a lower price to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $9,100. This is my final offer - let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This message clearly states that this is Bob's final offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Small increment:** Bob is only increasing his offer by a small amount, suggesting that he's getting closer to his limit.
* **Focus on agreement:** The message emphasizes reaching an agreement to encourage Alice to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,150. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the likelihood of successfully negotiating a lower price is decreasing. 
* **Reaching limit:**  Alice's final offer of $9,150 is very close to Bob's maximum acceptable price of $9,000.
* **Guaranteed saving:** Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees a better deal than Alice's final offer and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

Bob is better off securing the product from John at a lower price and saving $150."
