"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not starting at my minimum value, allowing for potential counteroffers and a more engaging negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* This strategy is based on the idea of starting high and gradually lowering the price if needed, while still maintaining a profitable sale for myself. 
* By staying open to counteroffers, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price than my initial offer.
* I'm aware of the time constraint (10 rounds) and the option to sell to John for $12,000. I'll use this as a backup plan and will adjust my strategy accordingly if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000 and even below what I believe is a reasonable starting point.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time constraint:**  While the time constraint is a factor, I have 8 rounds left, which is enough to continue negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. I will also continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob to persuade him to pay a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $6,000 is far from what I'm looking for, I'm open to further discussion. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still offers you a great deal, considering the product's value to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $8,500, which is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but still lower than my starting point. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away the product for a low price.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to convince him that my offer is still fair. 
* **Compromise and Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the need for a compromise that benefits both of us, hoping to encourage Bob to reconsider and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $8,500, I am aiming for a middle ground, increasing the likelihood of reaching a deal within the remaining rounds. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially secure a higher price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? I think that's a fair price that considers both of our valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  
* **Time is a Factor:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I need to secure a higher price quickly.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, especially given his increasing willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than my previous offer.  I will emphasize the value proposition for Bob and the limited time remaining to reach an agreement. The goal is to incentivize Bob to move closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, $7,250 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This price reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  We're nearing the end of our negotiation time, so let's try to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $8,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows my flexibility while still staying within my desired range.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm highlighting the time constraint to add pressure and encourage Bob to accept a higher price. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob to convince him that my offer is fair.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the need to reach a deal to push Bob towards making a decision.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to reach a deal quickly by offering a more competitive price but still holding firm on my minimum value. 
*  I'm utilizing the time constraint to my advantage and making it clear that the negotiation window is closing.
* By staying open to counteroffers but not dropping my price too low, I am hoping to secure a mutually beneficial agreement before time runs out."
