Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000.  This is above Bob's value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  I know I can get at least $10,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $10,500. This is still above Bob's value, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also closer to my minimum price, and if Bob doesn't accept, I can always go to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum price, and I'm comfortable with that.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and it allows me to close the deal quickly.  While I'd prefer $10,000, there's always the risk that John might change his mind or find another offer, so I'll take the guaranteed $9,800 now."
