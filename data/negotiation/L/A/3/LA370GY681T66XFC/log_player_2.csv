"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** Bob's maximum budget is $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is $100,000 over that. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a viable alternative.** If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to Bob's budget, it's still $50,000 over his limit. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and Bob can likely get the price down further.
* **John is a good fallback option.**  Bob can still buy the product from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,025,000? That's a good compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about we try $1,075,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being stubborn.**  She's refusing to budge from her price, even after rejecting Bob's counteroffer. 
* **The risk is too high.**  Bob is already $75,000 over his budget, and Alice shows no signs of compromising further.  
* **John is the safe option.**  John is willing to sell the product for Bob's maximum budget, eliminating the risk of going over. 

There are only 5 rounds remaining, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on a deal entirely. Buying from John guarantees he gets the product within his budget."
