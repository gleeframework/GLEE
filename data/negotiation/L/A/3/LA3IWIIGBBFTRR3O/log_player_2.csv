"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price from John, making it worthwhile to try and negotiate further.  There's potential to save a considerable amount by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my strong desire to get a good deal and sets the stage for negotiation. The goal is to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and start a back-and-forth process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my initial counteroffer, but it's getting closer to my desired price.  Rejecting and counter-offering again shows my commitment to getting a better deal while leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My previous counteroffer of $900,000 was rejected, indicating Alice is willing to negotiate but is likely not comfortable going that low. I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,000,000, which shows I'm serious about buying the product but am still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's initial offer. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping my maximum price in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still above my last counteroffer. I'm not yet ready to settle for $1,050,000. By rejecting and counter-offering again, I can potentially push for a price closer to $1,000,000 while keeping the negotiation active."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,025,000,  showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price.  This counteroffer is strategically placed to make a compromise seem more appealing to Alice, while still staying within my budget and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer.  At this point, we're in the final stages of negotiation, and the potential gains from continuing are minimal.  Accepting her offer allows me to secure the product at a price within my budget and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer, potentially ending the negotiation altogether.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John."
