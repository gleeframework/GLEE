{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than your minimum. This creates some room for negotiation, while also ensuring you're making a profit.  

It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better.  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little too low for me. How about $9,750? This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,750. This is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still above my minimum. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also shows I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9600 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below what I'd like, it's only $100 less than my counteroffer and  closer to my minimum. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not get me a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  I'm happy to close the deal and secure the sale."
