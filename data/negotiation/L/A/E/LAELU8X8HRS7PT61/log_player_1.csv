"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to counteroffer, starting the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, his message shows interest. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **John is a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to continue negotiating with Bob without immediate pressure. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price. It's a clear signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a significant loss.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for Bob, highlighting a ""good deal"" and a ""fair price"" for both of us.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm keeping the communication open by ending with a question, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a potential agreement.
* **John as a Safety Net:** John's offer provides a safety net. If Bob doesn't come up to a more acceptable price, I can always sell to John.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap further. I'll try to meet him halfway again, but I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($110).  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach a solution.
* **Highlighting a Fair Deal:** I'm framing this as a ""fair price"" for both of us, emphasizing that it's a win-win situation.
* **Urgency and Closing:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""close this deal,"" encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $110.  If we can't agree on that, I'm going to have to go with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on his offer of $110, and I'm unwilling to go below my minimum of $150.  
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly higher price. 
* **John is a Secure Option:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the best strategy. It ensures I achieve my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to budge."
