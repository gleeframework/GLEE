Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $150.  It also starts the conversation in a friendly manner.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $95 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 

I'm keeping the price above my minimum ($80) and hoping Bob will come up a bit more, but I'm also showing a willingness to negotiate further."
