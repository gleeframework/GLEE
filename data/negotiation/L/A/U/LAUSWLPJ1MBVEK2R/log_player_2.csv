"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is the same as John's price, there's no reason to buy immediately. By rejecting the offer, we can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price.  We have 10 rounds and a clear goal of saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. It's a significant reduction, but not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  This allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to our desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows us to continue trying to get a lower price without losing out on a potential deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're moving closer to a middle ground with this counteroffer.  It's halfway between our previous offer and Alice's most recent one. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to our desired price, and we've only got 5 rounds left.  Accepting this offer means saving $20,000 compared to buying from John.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that we'll run out of time and be forced to buy at the higher price."
