"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $7,500 is better than John's price of $8,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is still a good deal for Bob, saving him $800 compared to buying from John. While there's always the possibility of getting an even lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or further negotiation becoming too time-consuming outweighs the potential savings."
