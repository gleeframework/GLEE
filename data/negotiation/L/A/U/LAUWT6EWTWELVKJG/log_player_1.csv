{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my value, but I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps the door open to potentially sell to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell for such a drastic loss. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
