"Alice, thanks for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see and leaves room for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,175,000.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's aim for a win-win and close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,225,000.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
