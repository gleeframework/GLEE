Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to earn as much as possible, and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so you need to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than your minimum.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's a strong opening offer that still provides a substantial profit margin. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower offer.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, a higher starting point might be more strategic."
