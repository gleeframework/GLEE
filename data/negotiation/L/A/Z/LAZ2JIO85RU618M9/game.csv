"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1400000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and allows us to move forward with this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident that a price of $1550000 would be fair for both of us.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a good starting point for a successful deal. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to meet me halfway. While I value your offer, $1550000 is still below the price point that allows me to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1575000? This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal quickly. ",1575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. While $1575000 is tempting, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1525000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  We're so close, let's see if we can find that final compromise.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a solution.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again, but  $1525000 is still a bit too low. Let's bridge the gap with $1550000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your budget.  Let's make this happen! ",1550000.0,Alice,7,
