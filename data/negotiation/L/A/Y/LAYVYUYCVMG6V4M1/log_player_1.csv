Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000, she starts with a significantly higher price ($19,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals that Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob finds it too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have much information about Bob's financial limits or negotiation style. If she knew Bob was a tough negotiator, she might start with a lower price.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a guaranteed backup with John at $12,000."
