"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair and competitive price, considering its value to you. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  $900,000 is still too high, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. While $875,000 is better than $900,000, it's still higher than his target price. He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $870,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  $870,000 is a good price for him, as it's lower than his maximum budget and only slightly higher than his last counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and he would then have to buy from John for a significantly higher price."
