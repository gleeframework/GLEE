"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his $1,200,000 budget. Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate will give Bob a chance to potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1300000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $1325000. I think this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there might be some room for further negotiation,  it's getting risky to keep pushing as Bob has only 5 rounds left and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Therefore, the best option is to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $1,200,000, ensuring Bob gets the product within his budget."
