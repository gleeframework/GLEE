Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $1,250,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
