Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at this price still earns a much higher profit than selling to John for $10,000."
