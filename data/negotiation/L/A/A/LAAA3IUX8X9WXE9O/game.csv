"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm happy to pay $8500 for the product, which is still above your value of $8000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10000.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750, which is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, which is the price I initially offered. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
