Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  It also sets a clear expectation for a potentially profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's a fair compromise and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make another offer. How about $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum.  I'm confident that I can find another buyer who will pay more, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of losing him entirely."
