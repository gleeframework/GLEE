"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This reflects the value of the product for me and leaves some room for negotiation. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
