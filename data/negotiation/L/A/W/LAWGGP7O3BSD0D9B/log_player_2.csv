"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price from Alice. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $750,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still a good price for Bob. This counteroffer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If Alice accepts, Bob saves $100,000. If she rejects, he can adjust his counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but higher than Bob's counteroffer. This price is significantly lower than buying from John for $1,000,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $175,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will reject future counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
