,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I would like to counter with an offer of $95 for the product.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's meet in the middle at $92.50.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
