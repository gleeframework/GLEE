Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $9,500, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still above your minimum price of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear opening:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in further discussion.

By starting with a higher price, you leave room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to play out and potentially getting a price closer to your goal.  However, if Bob rejects this offer, you're always ready to move on to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum of $10,000 and even below the value Bob himself places on the product.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain your negotiating position:**  You've shown you're not desperate to sell at any price. 
* **Potentially get closer to your desired price:** By counteroffering, you might still be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Use John as leverage:**  Knowing you can walk away and sell to John for $10,000 gives you more power in the negotiation. 

You should counter with a price that's closer to your minimum while still being somewhat attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and my costs, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This gives you a good deal, and I can still make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from your initial offer but still above your minimum and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Reasoning:**  Providing a reason for the price helps maintain a sense of fairness.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message keeps the door open for further discussion, making Bob feel heard.

By showing flexibility while remaining firm on your minimum, you increase the chances of reaching an agreement that benefits both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,500 is still below your minimum of $10,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  you've already made significant concessions, and you have a guaranteed buyer in John.  

Here's why selling to John is the best choice:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a price that meets your minimum, ensuring you don't lose money on the deal.
* **Minimizes Risk:**  Further negotiation with Bob could drag on and ultimately result in a lower price or even a complete breakdown.
* **Saves Time and Energy:**  Selling to John is quick and straightforward, allowing you to move on to other opportunities.

While you might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, the potential gains are not worth the risk of a protracted negotiation that could ultimately result in a lower price or no deal at all."
