"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a wise investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm holding this product at a higher value due to its potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to offer $1,150,000,  which is closer to my budget and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
