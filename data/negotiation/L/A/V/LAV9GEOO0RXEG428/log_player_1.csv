"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $120 is a reasonable starting point, considering my belief in the product's value. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, indicating flexibility.

**Strategy:** I want to start by gauging Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a price closer to my perceived value. If not, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I think we can reach an agreement closer to $100. How about if we aim for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Time:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer more, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Each round is a potential loss of time. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a reasonable profit.
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $100, Bob's offer is slightly higher, making it a better option in this round.

**Strategy:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale with a profit, minimizing the risk of losing the deal through further negotiation."
