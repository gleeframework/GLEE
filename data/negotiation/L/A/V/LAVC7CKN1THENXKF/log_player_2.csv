"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. I have a unique product that holds immense value to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I am offering this product to you at a special price of $15000. This is an exclusive chance to acquire something truly exceptional. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You know the product is worth no more than $15,000 to you. Alice is offering the product for $15,000.  This means you can get the product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open, as you can still buy from John if you decide the product is worth it."
