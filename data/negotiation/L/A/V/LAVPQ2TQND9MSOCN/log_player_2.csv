# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, and it's within Bob's budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
