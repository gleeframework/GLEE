"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's significantly lower than that.  Let's talk about a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think about a price of $1000000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to maximize your savings."
