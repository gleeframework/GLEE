Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. It's time to negotiate."

Alice's offer:

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. It's worth another counteroffer to try and reach a more agreeable number."

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that the negotiation will continue for some time before reaching a price he's happy with, and John offers a price that is within his budget and immediately available."
