"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested,  $15,000 is a bit above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, would you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $13,000 is still a stretch.  Would you consider $11,500?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, which is $12,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
