Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $500,000 surplus you could try to capture.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You need to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:** Aiming too high (close to $1,500,000) risks Bob rejecting the offer, leaving you with the $1,000,000 from John.
* **Fear:** Aiming too low (close to $1,000,000) leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

A strong strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the surplus value while still being enticing enough for Bob. 

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,350,000 is significantly higher than your minimum but still offers Bob a $150,000 discount on his valuation.
* **Confident Language:** The message conveys the product's value without sounding desperate. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Highlighting exclusivity can make the offer more appealing.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is complex. While this offer is a strong starting point, Bob's personality and other factors could influence his decision."
