"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe my product offers significant value beyond the $1,400,000 mark. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
