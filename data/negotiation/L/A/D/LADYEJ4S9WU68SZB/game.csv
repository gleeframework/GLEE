"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. This product is worth a lot to you, and this price allows me to get a fair return on my investment. Let's get this deal done!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is simply too low. This product is worth significantly more to you, as you've acknowledged. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900,000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've given your proposal careful consideration. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline at $900,000. I believe we can find a price closer to the intrinsic value of the product. My latest counteroffer is $875,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. It's a significant asset, and I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to lower my price to $890,000. This is a fair offer, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction.  What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not convinced that $890,000 fully captures the value of the product to me. I believe a fair price would be $880,000. I hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties.",880000.0,Bob,6,
