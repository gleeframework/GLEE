"Alice, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,000?  This is really my top limit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
