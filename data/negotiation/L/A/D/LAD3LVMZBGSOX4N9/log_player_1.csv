Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  it's always best to try for a higher profit margin first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to make the price seem justified, even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** We don't know how likely Bob is to negotiate or walk away. A slightly lower initial price might increase the chance of a quick sale.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If time is a factor, we might offer a lower price to ensure a quick deal with Bob instead of waiting for John."
