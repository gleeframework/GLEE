"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point,  it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:** Bob's initial counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, showcasing his seriousness about finding a better deal.
* **Reasonable Price:** $1,000,000 is still a good profit for Alice, considering her minimum desired price of $800,000.
* **Sets the Tone:** This counteroffer sets the stage for a negotiation and gives Alice a point to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but the value this product brings to your business is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm still working towards a price that makes sense for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob is increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate, but also remaining firm about wanting a good deal.
* **Fair Compromise:** $1,100,000 is closer to Alice's last offer, indicating a potential compromise. 
* **Keeping Options Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while still allowing Bob to consider John's offer if Alice doesn't accept."
