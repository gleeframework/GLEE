"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant profit above our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** This initial offer helps us understand how eager Bob is to buy. His response will reveal if he's willing to accept a high price or if we need to adjust our strategy. 
* **John as Backup:** We always have the security of John's offer ($800,000), ensuring we won't settle for anything less than our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** Bob's counteroffer, though significantly lower, demonstrates his strong interest in the product. This suggests further negotiation can be fruitful.
* **Profit Potential:** While $1,000,000 is a substantial profit, it's still $300,000 less than our initial ask. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price.
* **John as Leverage:** We can use John's offer as a safety net but shouldn't settle for it prematurely. We have time to explore reaching a more favorable agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but the value this product brings to your business is substantial. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a counteroffer significantly lower than our initial ask but still aiming higher than Bob's offer.  A $100,000 decrease shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Value Emphasis:** We reiterate the product's significant value to Bob's business, justifying the higher price point and aiming to keep him engaged in the negotiation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, we keep the negotiation moving forward and signal our willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm still working towards a price that makes sense for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 represents a substantial profit of $300,000 over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** We've successfully moved Bob up $100,000 from his initial offer, indicating his willingness to compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit with a higher degree of certainty."
