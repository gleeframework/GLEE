Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's value leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal, even if you don't negotiate further.
* **Consider Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so you don't want to go below that price with Bob.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
