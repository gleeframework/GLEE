{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that's closer to Alice's value ($100) but still offers you some savings.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price point. While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer again allows you to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your bid slightly from the previous round.  You're signaling that you're willing to pay a bit more, but still within your target price range. This could potentially entice Alice to accept your offer or make a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within your acceptable price range of $150.  While you ideally would like to pay less, continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a stalemate or a higher counteroffer from Alice. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of paying more from John."
