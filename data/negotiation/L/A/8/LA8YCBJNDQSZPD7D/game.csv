"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $101? I'm really trying to work with you here.",101.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $101 is still a tad high.  Would you consider $99?  That's a fair compromise.",99.0,Bob,6,
