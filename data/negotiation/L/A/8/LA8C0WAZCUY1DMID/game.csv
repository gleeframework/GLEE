"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12500 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $14000?  It's a fair price for a product with this much value. Let's get this deal done.",14000.0,Alice,5,
