"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $14,000 is still too low.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $15,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,6,
