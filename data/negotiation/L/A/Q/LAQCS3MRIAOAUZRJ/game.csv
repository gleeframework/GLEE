"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $160.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $135 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $145?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to do $140 to wrap this up.",140.0,Bob,6,
