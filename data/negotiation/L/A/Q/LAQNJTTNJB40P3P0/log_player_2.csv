"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this work. This is a fair price, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a way to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more counteroffers and a longer process, potentially wasting time and not necessarily resulting in a lower price."
