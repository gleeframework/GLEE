Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my initial valuation ($12,000) creates a sense of a deal for Bob. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob directly might be faster than waiting for John, even if the price difference isn't huge.

By starting with a strong offer, I leave room for negotiation if Bob counters. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
