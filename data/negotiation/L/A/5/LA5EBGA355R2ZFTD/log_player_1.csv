"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting point and below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still significantly above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm trying to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer more,  it's getting close to the guaranteed price from John, and I don't want to risk losing this deal entirely.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
