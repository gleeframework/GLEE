Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language (""fantastic product,"" ""think you'll love"") to create a good impression and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with an open-ended question (""What do you think?"") to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy is designed to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have more room to negotiate down to a price that's still profitable for me.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay for the product.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By using an open-ended question, I'm encouraging Bob to participate in the negotiation and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $100, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore that option.

By rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round, I can:

* **Potentially secure a higher price:**  I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Gain more information:**  Bob's counteroffer will give me a better understanding of his budget and his seriousness about buying the product.
* **Maintain control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and can guide it towards a more favorable outcome.

Selling to John for $100 would be a safe option, but it wouldn't be as profitable as potentially securing a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $120 is closer, but I'm still a little ways off from where I need to be. How about $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $135, which is a compromise between my initial price of $150 and Bob's offer of $120.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""fair compromise"") to make it more persuasive and less arbitrary.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language (""closer"") to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm again using an open-ended question to encourage Bob's participation in the negotiation.

This strategy is designed to:

* **Move the negotiation forward:** By making a counteroffer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and keep the process moving.
* **Maintain a balanced approach:** My counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Encourage a positive outcome:** By using positive language and a fair compromise approach, I'm hoping to increase the chances of reaching an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $125. This is my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $125 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $100, and it's only $10 less than my previous counteroffer.  Considering that he has stated this is his final offer, it's likely that further negotiation will be unproductive.

Accepting his offer means I can secure a sale and avoid the risk of him walking away entirely. This is a reasonable outcome that allows me to earn a significant profit while ensuring the sale of the product."
