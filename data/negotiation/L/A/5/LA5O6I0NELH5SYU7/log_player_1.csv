Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good profit for me. It's important to note that I'm willing to go as low as $1,000,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept his offer and secure a sale, it's too far below my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to counteroffer to try and reach a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum threshold and secures a sale.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether, and I'm confident that selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option if this deal falls through."
