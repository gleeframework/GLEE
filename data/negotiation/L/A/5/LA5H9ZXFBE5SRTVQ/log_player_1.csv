Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm aiming for a win-win here. I'm asking for $14,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I see the value in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering a price significantly lower than my initial ask, but it's still a profit. However, I believe I have room to negotiate further and get closer to my desired price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're really close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000 even?  That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
