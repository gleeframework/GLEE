"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a price that reflects its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  It makes sense to start negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he's still paying more than he would from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My absolute maximum is $9,000.  If you're not able to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,250 is getting closer to his budget, he's still paying more than he would from John. It's worth seeing if he can get a slightly lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move forward with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're very close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession to meet your needs. How about we meet at $9,150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to his target price, it's unlikely that she'll go lower than $9,000.  He's already rejected two offers at $9,000, and he doesn't want to risk running out of rounds and being forced to pay more than he wants.  John is a reliable alternative, and Bob can get the product at his target price of $8,000."
