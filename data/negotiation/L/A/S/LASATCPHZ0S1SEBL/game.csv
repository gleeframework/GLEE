"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250?  This would give us both a fair outcome.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about we try $8,875?",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $8,875 is closer, but still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and I think it could work for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price. How about we settle at $9,000? This would allow me to make a sale and still ensure I get a price that's fair for the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,7,
