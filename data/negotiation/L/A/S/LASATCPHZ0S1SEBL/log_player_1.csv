Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price for myself.  I'll need to use my negotiation skills to see if I can move him closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250?  This would give us both a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about we try $8,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $8,875 is closer, but still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and I think it could work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price?
