"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and there's room for negotiation before you need to resort to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is still above your maximum limit of $1,000,000.  However, you are very close to your maximum. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get to that $1,000,000 price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more offer to you, and that's $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is still a bit higher than your ideal price of $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  Since you have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to secure that deal and avoid any further risk of Alice rejecting your final offer."
