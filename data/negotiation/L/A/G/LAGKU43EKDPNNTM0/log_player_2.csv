Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9,300. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.

It seems like Alice is not willing to go much lower than $9,300.  At this point, the potential savings are not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a price closer to John's offer.  It's more strategic to buy from John for $12,000 and avoid further haggling."
