It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so there's room to potentially save even more money."

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that might be appealing to her.  This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to potentially go higher if necessary."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still trying to keep the price lower than her latest offer. This shows flexibility while remaining firm on my desire for a lower price."
