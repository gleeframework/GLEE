**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging from $9,500 even with the promise of a ""small bonus"" which is likely insignificant.  It's clear she's aiming for the highest possible price. At this point, the potential savings from haggling further with Alice are minimal compared to the risk of her remaining firm. Buying from John for $12,000 ensures I get the product without further negotiation hassle."
