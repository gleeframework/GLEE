"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
