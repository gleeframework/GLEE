"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and see if you can get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's come down from $15,000,  $13,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get her closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However,  $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the fact that we're both eager to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to negotiate, $11,000 is still outside your maximum budget of $8,000.  You have a few rounds left to negotiate, and it's worth seeing if you can get her closer to your target price. You could also potentially look at buying the product from John for $8,000, if things don't work out with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I truly appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to sell the product for more than your minimum price and me to acquire it within my budget.  I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement on this figure."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer of $9,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for Bob's budget.  While Alice has made concessions, there are only a few rounds left in the negotiation and the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is within his budget.  It's a safer option to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation."
