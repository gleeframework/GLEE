Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I truly appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to sell the product for more than your minimum price and me to acquire it within my budget.  I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement on this figure.
