"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However,  $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the fact that we're both eager to close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I truly appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to sell the product for more than your minimum price and me to acquire it within my budget.  I'm hopeful that we can come to an agreement on this figure.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $9,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,7,
