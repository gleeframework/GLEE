Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is close, but to make this work, I need to get at least $1,175,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue.  She's shown no willingness to go below $1,175,000, and you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 with John. It makes the most sense to secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
