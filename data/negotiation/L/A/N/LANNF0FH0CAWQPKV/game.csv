"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is close, but to make this work, I need to get at least $1,175,000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
