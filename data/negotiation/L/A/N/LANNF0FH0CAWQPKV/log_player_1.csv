"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a highly favorable deal.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high starting price, even though it's not explicitly stated what the product is.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how eager he is to acquire the product.
2. **Establish a Strong Position:** Starting high sets the tone for the negotiation, potentially leading Bob to counteroffer closer to my desired range.
3. **Leave Room for Concessions:**  As the negotiation progresses, I can strategically lower the price to make the deal more appealing while still aiming for a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000).  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is a guaranteed profit, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, Above Minimum:** I significantly decreased my price from $1,600,000 to $1,300,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, this price still remains comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Justification:** Instead of directly addressing his low valuation, I'm emphasizing the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point.
* **Encouraging a Realistic Counter:** By offering a price closer to my target range, I aim to encourage Bob to propose a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still $150,000 short. While selling to John guarantees my minimum, I think there's a chance Bob might be willing to go slightly higher.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is close, but to make this work, I need to get at least $1,175,000 for the product. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm coming down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm also setting a clear, firm boundary that I won't go below $1,175,000. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency, hoping to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer leaves a small gap for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, but it keeps the deal beneficial for me.

By this point, it's important to be aware of the dwindling rounds. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm likely better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
