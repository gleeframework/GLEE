"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
