Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards if Bob counters.
* **Highlight Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning other potential buyers (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still providing him a compelling offer."
