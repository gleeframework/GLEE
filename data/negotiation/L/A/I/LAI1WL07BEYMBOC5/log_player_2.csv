"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer closer to your range, or you can always fall back on purchasing from John at a much lower price."
