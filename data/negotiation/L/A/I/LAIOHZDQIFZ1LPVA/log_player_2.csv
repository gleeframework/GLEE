# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  $13,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,500 is better than $13,000, it's still too high for him. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
