"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to part with the product, $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
