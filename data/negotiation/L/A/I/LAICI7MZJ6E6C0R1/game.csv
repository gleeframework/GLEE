"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $950000 is still above my initial budget. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects its value while allowing for a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of 875000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your initial budget and the product's true value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
