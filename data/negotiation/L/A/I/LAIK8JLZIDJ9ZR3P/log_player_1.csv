Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I make a profit. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price, but if Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,700,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway,  showing I'm willing to negotiate. This also keeps the price closer to my initial offer and hopefully will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting closer to my desired price. Although I'm still hoping for a bit more, it's a reasonable offer that is within my acceptable range.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and being forced to sell to John for a lower price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
