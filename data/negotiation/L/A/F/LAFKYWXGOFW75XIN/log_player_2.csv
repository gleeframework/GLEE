"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  A counteroffer is necessary to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Alice a chance to suggest a price closer to your ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down slightly, but her offer is still above both your budget and what John offers. It's worth trying to negotiate further before accepting a price above your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's valuable, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're now pushing our maximum budget. This counteroffer is firm but fair, giving Alice a chance to accept a price you're comfortable with."
