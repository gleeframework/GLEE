"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500 for this exceptional item. This offer is tailored to ensure that you receive the best possible deal while maximizing my earnings. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting the offer, you can see if Alice will come down to a more reasonable price or proceed with buying from John."
