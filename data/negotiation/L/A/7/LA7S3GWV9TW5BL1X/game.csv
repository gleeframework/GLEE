"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering its value to you,  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  It's a good middle ground between our offers, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,800?  It's closer to your value, and it's a fair price for what I'm looking for.  What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  $10,000 would be a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  How about $9,900?  It's just a small step closer to my last offer, and I'm confident we can seal the deal at that price.  What do you say?",9900.0,Bob,6,
