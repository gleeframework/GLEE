Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe its value will bring you significant returns. I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Gauge the Waters:** This initial offer is a way to see how badly Bob wants the product. His response will determine my next move. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). I have the leverage to negotiate further, knowing I have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is below my bottom line.  I could consider $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true worth of this product."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but remaining firm above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's worth, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its value and the potential benefits it offers him.
* **Mid-Ground:**  $1,300,000 represents a middle ground that could potentially satisfy both parties. Bob gets a lower price than initially offered, while I remain above my minimum acceptable price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting his offer secures the sale at my desired price point."
