"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
