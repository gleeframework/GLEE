"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than her product valuation ($12,000 vs. $8,000). There's a good chance we can negotiate a much better price by making a counteroffer. While John's offer of $15,000 is our fallback, we should aim lower before resorting to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. This approach:

* **Signals our interest:** We don't want to lowball and risk Alice walking away.
* **Aims for a win-win:** We want a price that's fair for both parties.
* **Leaves us bargaining power:** We can always increase our offer if needed, but starting lower gives us more room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice moved a bit from her initial offer, but we're still in a good negotiating position. Her offer of $11,000 is still significantly higher than her valuation of $8,000.  We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** We acknowledge Alice's concession and counter with a smaller decrease on our side, moving closer to the middle ground.
* **Test her flexibility:** By offering $10,000, we're aiming for a price that's still favorable to us but might be tempting for Alice to accept. 
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  We don't want to appear overly eager, so we stick to a price that offers a reasonable saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that $11,500 is her final offer.  This is only a slight improvement from her previous offer and still far above her valuation. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away. Buying from John at $15,000, while not ideal, ensures we get the product and avoids a potentially fruitless back-and-forth."
