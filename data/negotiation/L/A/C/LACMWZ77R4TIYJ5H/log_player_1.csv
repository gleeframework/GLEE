"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and also signals my belief in the product's worth.  I'm aware that John will offer me $15,000, but I'm aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $14,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $16,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500} 
```

I'm offering a price of $16,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still a price that's higher than what Bob offered, indicating that I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a good deal considering that I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $15,000.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $15,200, which is a better outcome for me."
