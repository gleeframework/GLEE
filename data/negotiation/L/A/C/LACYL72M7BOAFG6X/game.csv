"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1300000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to come down that far.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1300000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. We've been close to a deal a couple of times now, and I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $1350000? This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I place on this unique product. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
