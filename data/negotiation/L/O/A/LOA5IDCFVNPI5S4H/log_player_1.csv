Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to potentially increase the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 12500}
