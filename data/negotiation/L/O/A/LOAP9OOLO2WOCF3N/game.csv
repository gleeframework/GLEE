"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $10,250. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
