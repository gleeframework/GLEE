"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $980,000. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
