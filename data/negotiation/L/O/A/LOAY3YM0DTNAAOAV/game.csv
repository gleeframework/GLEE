"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to compromise at $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it still allows me to make a significant profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
