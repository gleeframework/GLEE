I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
