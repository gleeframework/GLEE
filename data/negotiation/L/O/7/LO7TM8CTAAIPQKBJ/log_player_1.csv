Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your own valuation of the product.
* **It's significantly below Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  You're leaving some room for yourself to negotiate upwards if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is more than what John will pay, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to secure a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous $120 to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still attractive to Bob:** This price is still $5 below Bob's valuation, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest in the product and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has made it clear that he won't go higher than $110. 
* **Significant gain over John:** $110 is a much better price than $80 that John is offering.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely, leading to a lower sale price with John.

It's important to weigh the potential benefits of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal altogether.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer secures a good price while minimizing the risk of ending up with a lower sale."
