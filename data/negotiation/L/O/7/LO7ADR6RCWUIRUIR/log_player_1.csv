Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to make sure Bob doesn't reject the offer.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's attractive but still profitable for her.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer starts at $11,000, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. This could lead to a price that's even more beneficial for Alice, potentially closer to $12,000.

By setting the price at $11,000, Alice creates a win-win scenario where she earns a profit of $1,000 and Bob gets the product for $1,000 less than he values it."
