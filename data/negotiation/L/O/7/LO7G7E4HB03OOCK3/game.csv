"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a great deal.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we split the difference and do $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $11,875. This price is fair for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let's close this deal.",11875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me. I appreciate you meeting me halfway a couple of times now. How about we make this the last exchange - would you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a little below where I need to be.  How about we close this deal at $11,750?  I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment at this price.  Let's make this happen.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been great to work with and this is a nice product.  I'm ready to close the deal right now if you can do $11,600.  Otherwise, I think I'll need to go with a different option.",11600.0,Bob,8,
