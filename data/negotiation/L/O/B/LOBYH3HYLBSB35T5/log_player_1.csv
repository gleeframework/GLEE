Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. While $10,500 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to secure a deal closer to my initial offer.  I'll counter with a price closer to $11,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,200? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $11,200 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $10,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,800 is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again - how about $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $10,900.  If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close, and I'm confident that I can still get a decent profit. I'd rather close the deal now and avoid further negotiation, especially with John offering only $10,000."
