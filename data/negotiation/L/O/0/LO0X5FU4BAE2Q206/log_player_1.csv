Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value of the product, you're subtly justifying the higher price without explicitly stating your minimum.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you a better understanding of his willingness to pay and how to proceed.  

Remember:  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so you're not at risk of losing out."
