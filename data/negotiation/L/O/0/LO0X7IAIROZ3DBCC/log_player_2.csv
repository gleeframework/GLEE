Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

How about $11,500? This is a final offer from me, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a reasonable compromise:

* **Savings:** You're still saving $500 compared to John's price. 
* **Risk:**  Further haggling could lead to Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at full price. 

It's a good time to accept and secure the deal with Alice."
