"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price point. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $11,500? This is a final offer from me, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
