"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $135. This is a great deal, as it's below my usual selling price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the product from John for $120, which is lower than Alice's offer.  It's always best to try and get the lowest price possible!"
