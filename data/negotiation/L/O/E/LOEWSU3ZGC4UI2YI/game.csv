"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be of great value to you.  My initial offer is $1,150,000. This reflects the product's significant worth and leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident in the value of this product to you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This offer reflects both the product's worth and our desire to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,075,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close the deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to compromise a bit further. Let's try $1,090,000. This is a solid price that acknowledges the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident we can close this deal with a little more flexibility on both sides.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can close this deal at this price.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,085,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal now. ",1085000.0,Alice,7,
