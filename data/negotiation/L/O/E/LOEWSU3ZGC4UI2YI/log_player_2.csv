Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,085,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal now.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is still trying to save money, Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is getting close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,080,000. This represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  Given that there are only a few rounds remaining, it's likely that Bob won't be able to negotiate a lower price.  Accepting the offer now secures the product at a favorable price."
