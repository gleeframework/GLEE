"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000, a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both your $12,000 limit and John's $12,000 offer. It makes the most financial sense to buy from John."
