Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum value of $12,000. I'm confident that I can adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, and I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything significantly below my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible and come down a bit from my initial price.  This should give Bob a chance to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go lower than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. At this point, it's clear he's not willing to meet me even halfway. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
