Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I'd like to discuss some additional benefits or perks that come with the product. Can we talk about what's included in the sale?

While we're close to my ideal price, Bob's request for additional benefits signals he's unlikely to go higher. Accepting the $1,900,000 offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
