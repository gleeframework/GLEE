"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13500 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $11500. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think $13000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, which is the price I was initially willing to pay for the product from John. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
