Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and your potential return on investment, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a great opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, getting Bob to buy at a higher price earns more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. This price is still significantly below your minimum and allows Bob to potentially gain some value compared to your alternative offer. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, creating a sense of desirability and justifying the high price."
