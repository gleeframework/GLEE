"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $15,000. I believe there's room to negotiate, and I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $15500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum price of $15,000, and it's a good compromise.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
