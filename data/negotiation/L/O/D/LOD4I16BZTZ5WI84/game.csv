"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $15500. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15500.0,Bob,4,
