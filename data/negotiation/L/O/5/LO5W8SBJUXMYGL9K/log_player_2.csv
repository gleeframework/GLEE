"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but her offer is already at $95. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations fail, you still have a way to get the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your range:** $85 is still below your maximum price of $120.
* **Reasonable starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** It's possible Alice will counter with a price closer to $90, which you could then accept or counter with a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price range. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to lower her price, and you can likely push for a better deal.
* **John remains a viable alternative.**  You're willing to pay up to $120 from John, and there's a chance you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's price:**  $90 is a compromise between your previous offer of $85 and Alice's current offer of $100.
* **Showing willingness to meet halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates you're serious about reaching an agreement and willing to compromise.
* **Still within your budget:** This price is still within your maximum price point of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she's lowered the price again, $105 is still above what you're willing to pay.
* **John is a viable alternative.**  The deal with John is within your budget, and you've already established that you're willing to buy from him if you can't reach a satisfactory price with Alice. 
* **More negotiation is possible.** It's likely Alice is willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale to John.  You can try to negotiate further without risking losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice halfway:**  $95 is a compromise between your previous offer of $90 and Alice's current offer of $105. 
* **Showing a commitment to closing the deal:** This counteroffer demonstrates that you're taking Alice's offers seriously and are actively trying to reach a compromise.
* **Close to your maximum price:** This price is only slightly above your target price, making it a good point to stop if Alice doesn't accept.
* **Leaves room for one more counteroffer:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can still counter with a price closer to your target price.

This is a strategic move to close the deal while still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum.** $110 is still a bit high, but it's closer to your $120 limit. 
* **John is still a viable option.** If you can't reach a deal with Alice, you'll still be able to buy from John.
* **One more counteroffer:**  You have the opportunity to make one more counteroffer and try to get a price closer to your target. This is worth exploring before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:** This is your last attempt to get a better price. You're willing to pay $100, which is close to your target price and significantly lower than Alice's offer.
* **High-stakes negotiation:**  It's a high-risk, high-reward situation. Alice might accept, saving you $20, or reject, forcing you to buy from John.
* **Taking a stand:** This counteroffer demonstrates you're serious about negotiating but also prepared to walk away if you don't get a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While she's lowered the price again, $115 is still too close to your maximum price of $120 for it to be worth further negotiation. 
* **John's offer is your fallback.**  You know you can get the product from John for $120, which is only $5 more than Alice's current offer. 
* **Risk of going over budget:** You only have one round left. There's a high risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, leaving you with no other options. 

It's better to secure the product from John at a slightly higher price than risk losing the opportunity to buy it at all."
