"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and John's offer ($100).  It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($80) leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of your budget. It also tests Alice's willingness to move down from her initial high price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved down slightly, $130 is still above both your maximum budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere, say around $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now getting closer to both your budget and John's offer.  Offering $100, your maximum budget, puts the ball in Alice's court and signals you're serious but not willing to overspend."
