Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still higher than what Bob values the product at. This strategy aims to:

* **Start the negotiation:**  It shows I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I have room to lower the price if necessary, but still aim for a profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will tell me how serious he is about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $14,000.  While he's shown interest, his offer is not a realistic starting point for a negotiation.  

**Why not sell to John?**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though John offers a guaranteed $15,000,  there's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob,  potentially getting closer to my desired value of $15,000 or even higher. 

**Next steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point.  This will signal my seriousness while still allowing room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $12,000, which is halfway between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000), shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It indicates I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintain leverage:**  It leaves some room for further negotiation if needed but keeps the price closer to my desired value. 
* **Entice Bob:**  By offering a middle ground, it increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
