"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors and contribute greatly to your success. This product holds immense value to me, but its true potential lies in the hands of someone like yourself who can fully appreciate and utilize its capabilities.

Considering its intrinsic worth and the impact it could have on your business or personal projects, I am offering you the chance to own this product at a special introductory price. My proposal is to extend the offer at a price of $800,000, which I believe is a fair compromise reflecting both the value of the product and the opportunity it presents to you.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further or if you require any additional information about the product. I am here to answer any questions you might have and help facilitate a smooth transaction.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could get the product from John for $1,000,000, Alice is offering it for $800,000, which saves him $200,000.  This aligns with Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible."
