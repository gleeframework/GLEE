You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price.  You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so you have some leverage."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $780,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  How about $820,000?  This would still be a fantastic deal for you and would allow me to make a reasonable profit.

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice has come down a bit, and you're closer to your target price of $800,000.  Let's see if you can get her even lower."
