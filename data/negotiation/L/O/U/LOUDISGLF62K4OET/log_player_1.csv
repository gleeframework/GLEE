{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to me. Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low. I will try to negotiate with him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I need a price that works for me. How about $9,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,500 is better than $8,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. I will continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you - finding a price that works for both of us is important.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 11000}
