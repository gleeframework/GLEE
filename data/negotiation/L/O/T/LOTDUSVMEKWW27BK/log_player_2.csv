# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way too high. It's time to counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

Alice's offer is still too high for me. While $1,750,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still significantly above my budget. It's time to go with the safe option and buy from John."
