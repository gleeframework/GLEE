"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  While I agree it's a great product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value it holds for me. How about we try $1,080,000?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
