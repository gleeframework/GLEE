"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob has a clear maximum price point of $12,000 and should aim to get the best deal possible.  Rejecting the offer allows for potential for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  $9,000 still leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that might be agreeable to both parties. 
* **Maintains the Goal:**  This counteroffer is well within Bob's maximum budget of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9500? I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  $9,500 is a good price, but there's still room to negotiate. 
* **The Goal is to Save:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps the potential for an even lower price. 
* **John is an Option:**  If negotiations fail, Bob has a reliable alternative with John's offer of $12,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway. 
* **Staying Within Budget:** It's still below Bob's max of $12,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer gauges Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a deal."
