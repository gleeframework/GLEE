"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's uniqueness and value. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a fair compromise given my budget constraints and the value I see in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit above your initial budget, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's uniqueness and value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1600000 is still outside my budget.  Given the product's value, I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  My final offer is $1500000. This is the absolute maximum I can go, but I truly believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you've made a final offer of $1500000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,7,
