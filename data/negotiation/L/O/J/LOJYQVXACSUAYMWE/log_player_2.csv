"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $150. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still within your budget and offers a potential savings. It's also a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Given your valuation and our current negotiation process, I propose we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about $112.50 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is closer to the midpoint, but it's still above your target price of $150. You can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows you to try and get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to split the difference again. How about $108.75 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the pattern of splitting the difference, showing your commitment to reaching a fair deal. It also keeps the price within your budget while allowing for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this negotiation. I've considered your latest proposal and would like to suggest a price of $110. This is slightly above your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $110 is still outside of your $150 limit.  It's better to continue negotiating and try to reach a price that fits within your budget. You have several rounds remaining, so there's still time to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $110 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $109.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but still keep the price below your $150 threshold.  It also sets the stage for a potential final offer in the next round if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $109.50. I believe this price reflects the value you see in the product while allowing us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $109.5 is very close to your counteroffer of $109 and falls within your budget of $150.  It is in your best interest to accept this offer and close the deal. You've successfully negotiated a price that is favorable to you, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely."
