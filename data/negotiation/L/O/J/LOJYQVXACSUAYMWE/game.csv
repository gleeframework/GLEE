"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting the negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Given your valuation and our current negotiation process, I propose we aim for a price closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about $112.50 for the product?",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to split the difference again. How about $108.75 for the product?",108.75,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this negotiation. I've considered your latest proposal and would like to suggest a price of $110. This is slightly above your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $110 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $109.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $109.50.
