"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After considering the market value and our initial conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is significantly less than John's offer."
