"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $100. It's a steal at this price, and I know you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still within what I think Bob is likely to pay. It's important to leave some room for negotiation, but also to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than my minimum of $80, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much to you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit. I'm also keeping the message positive and reaffirming the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on his offer of $90, and while I'd prefer more, it's still a good deal for me. I'm also aware that we're already on round 4, and the risk of losing a sale to John or going through more rounds of negotiation outweighs the potential for a higher price."
