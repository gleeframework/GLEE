"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop the price to $9,250. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope it's something you can work with.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, as I mentioned before. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and pay $9,125. Can you consider that?",9125.0,Bob,6,
