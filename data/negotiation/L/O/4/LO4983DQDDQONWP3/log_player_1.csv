"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and still achieve a good outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer helps me understand how interested Bob is and how he might negotiate. His response will give me valuable information for the next round. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer in mind ($12,000), I won't go too low too quickly. I have a backup plan if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below both my minimum ($12,000) and his own stated value ($10,000). Accepting this would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** His lowball offer is likely a negotiation tactic. By rejecting it, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and not going to accept any low offer. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** We are still early in the negotiation (Round 2). I have room to counter and try to find a price that works for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. I believe this offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Lowered Price:** I've lowered my price by $3,000 from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price of $15,000 is still comfortably above my absolute minimum of $12,000, giving me room to bargain.
* **Strong Stance:** My message emphasizes the value of the product, justifying the higher price point. I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is above my absolute minimum of $12,000. While I could push for more, it's a relatively small difference.
* **Strong Position:** Bob has moved closer to my price range throughout the negotiation, indicating he's serious about buying. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures the sale. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and while John offers $12,000, the difference is negligible compared to the potential risk of delaying further. 

**Overall, accepting $11,500 is a good outcome in this scenario. It's a profit, and I avoid the risk of losing the sale by pushing for a marginally higher price.**"
