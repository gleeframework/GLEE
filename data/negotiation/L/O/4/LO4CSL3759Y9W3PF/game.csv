"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm really hoping to get closer to $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  How about we try to split the difference between our last offers?  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
