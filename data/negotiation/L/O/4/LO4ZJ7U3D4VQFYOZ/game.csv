"Hello Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair price to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we do $11,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much on this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need that price to budge a little more. Would you consider $10,500? That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $12,000 again, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
