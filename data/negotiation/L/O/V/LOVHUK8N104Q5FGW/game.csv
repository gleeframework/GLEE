"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $97.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",97.5,Alice,5,
