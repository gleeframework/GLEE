"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's a good starting price, but Bob should try to get a better deal.  He can reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should keep trying to get a lower price.  $11,000 is still above his desired price point, and he can likely get it for less if he's patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is close to his desired price point, but he can likely still get a slightly better deal.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I think it's time to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're close to a deal, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10700. This is a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get for your money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has reached a point where he is very close to his target price and has limited rounds left. He has rejected several offers already and a risk of Alice deciding to stop the negotiation altogether. Accepting the offer at this point makes the most sense, as it will save him money and ensure he gets the product."
