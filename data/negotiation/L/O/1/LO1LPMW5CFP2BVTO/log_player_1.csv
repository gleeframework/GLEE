Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, Alice leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It also emphasizes the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to go below that price."
