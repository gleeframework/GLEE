"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $900,000 is still above my target price.  Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, given the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still quite a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
