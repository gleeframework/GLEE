Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Not going too high:** I don't want to scare Bob off immediately, so I'm not asking for my full minimum value.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit and keeping Bob interested in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is a potential buyer, it's likely I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay my minimum price provides me with the security to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still represents a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussion by stating ""Let's see if we can find common ground."" This shows willingness to reach an agreement. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still keeping my potential profit close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $13,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiations with John:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $15,000, there's a chance that John might be willing to negotiate down slightly if I inform him that I'm close to finalizing a deal with another buyer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is the most strategic option at this point. It secures a sale close to my minimum and leaves room for potential negotiation with John for a slightly higher price."
