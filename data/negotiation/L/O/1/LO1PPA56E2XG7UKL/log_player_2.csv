"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, and Alice's offer is significantly higher than that. It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $9,250. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should continue negotiating, keeping in mind that he has a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,125? This is a fair price that is close to both our numbers and allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer of $9,200 is still more than what Bob can get from John, and he only has a few rounds left. It's better to secure the product for a lower price with John than risk losing out on the product entirely by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
