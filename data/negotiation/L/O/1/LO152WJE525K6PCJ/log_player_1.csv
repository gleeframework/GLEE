This offer is a starting point. It's high, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep Bob engaged and interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in your product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for less than what I believe the product is worth. I'll send a counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this price still provides you with a strong return on investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking to secure a better deal.  I'm prepared to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum price, and it's a fair deal considering our back-and-forth negotiation.  It's not ideal, but it's a good outcome. Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale without risking a further decline in price or having to deal with additional rounds of negotiation."
