"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in your product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this price still provides you with a strong return on investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking to secure a better deal.  I'm prepared to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
