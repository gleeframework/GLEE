Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is closer to my minimum, I still have rounds left and I can try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $92.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 92.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $87.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have rounds left and I think I can get a better price.  I'm also considering the fact that John is willing to pay $120, which makes me more hesitant to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 90}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $86.50 is close to my minimum, I still have rounds left. I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $120, which makes me more hesitant to accept a low offer from Bob. I'm hopeful that I can still get a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, $86.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $88.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 88}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $88 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $84.50. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the last few rounds, and Bob's offers are getting too low. I'm not comfortable going lower than my minimum of $120, and I don't want to risk not getting a deal at all.  John is a sure thing at a price I'm happy with."
