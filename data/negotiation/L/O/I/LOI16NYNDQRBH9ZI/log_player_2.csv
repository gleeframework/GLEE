Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **You're close to your limit:**  $105 is within your $150 budget and a reasonable compromise.
* **Further negotiation might fail:** Alice has indicated she's firm on her price. Pushing further could lead to her breaking off the negotiation.
* **Time value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a decent price."
