"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $175? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $70, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,4,
