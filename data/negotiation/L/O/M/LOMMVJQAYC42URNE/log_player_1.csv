Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120.  This allows room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price while still leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, I don't want to lose a potential sale.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a great deal for a product you'll love."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $117.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we settle at $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 122.5}
