"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $900,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's below his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Beneficial to Alice:** It's significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to quickly gauge Bob's interest and potentially close the deal early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Alice has 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a good chance she can get closer to her desired price.  Selling to John right now would be a missed opportunity to potentially earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm on minimum price:**  Alice is still above her minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  She's showing flexibility, but not giving away too much.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to create a sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $875000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $825000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This offer is my absolute maximum, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time to negotiate:**  Alice has 6 rounds left. She can still potentially push for a higher price, especially since Bob is willing to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John would be a loss:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 now would mean giving up any chance of getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, but $825,000 simply doesn't work for me.  This product is truly exceptional, and I believe it's worth more.  To demonstrate my willingness to find common ground, I'm offering to reduce my price to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** Alice is lowering her price slightly from $875,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reiterating value:** She emphasizes the product's uniqueness to justify the higher price.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message positions the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer you $810000. This is my absolute final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our willingness to negotiate. If we can't reach an agreement at this point, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $810,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time running out:**  Alice has only 4 rounds left, so the pressure is on to get a better deal. 
* **Potential for a counteroffer:** Bob has stated this is his ""final offer,"" but there's always a chance he might budge if Alice rejects it. 
* **Selling to John would be a loss:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 now would mean giving up any chance of getting a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:** Alice will try one more counteroffer to see if she can push Bob to accept a higher price. If that fails, she may need to consider selling to John in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're reaching your limit, but $810,000 is still too far from what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference and call it $830,000.  This is a final concession from me.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 830000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** Alice is emphasizing that this is her final offer to try and push Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  She is offering a midpoint between her last offer and Bob's, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Direct Approach:** The message is straightforward and focuses on the need to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Alternative Options:** The reminder of alternative options subtly increases the pressure on Bob to accept."
