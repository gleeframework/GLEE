"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you ($1,200,000) and is below her own valuation of $1,000,000. There is room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price is fair, considering your value for the product, and it's within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting my counteroffer closer to my maximum budget ($1,200,000) but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  The offer is above Alice's valuation, showing I'm willing to be fair. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not offering the full $1,200,000, so there's potential to reach an agreement without hitting my absolute limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  I'm not ready to accept her offer yet, but I'll continue to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering your own valuation and my budget.  I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing for a Better Price:** I'm still aiming to save as much as possible.  
* **Fair Offer:**  My counteroffer is at Alice's minimum value, showing I'm willing to be fair. 
* **Setting Boundaries:** By not going above $1,000,000, I'm setting a firm upper limit on what I'm willing to pay."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,025,000.

This is a fair price considering your valuation and my budget. It's a significant step closer to my previous offer, and I'm hopeful you'll find it acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,012,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a great deal for me! Alice has lowered her offer to $1,012,000, which is just slightly above my last counteroffer and significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's only one round left, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer, so I'm going to accept this deal."
