Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to pay. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price is fair, considering your value for the product, and it's within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
