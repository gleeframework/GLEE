"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think this is a great price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get a better deal from John ($10,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you can maximize your savings."
