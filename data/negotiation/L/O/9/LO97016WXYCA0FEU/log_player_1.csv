Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1300000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
