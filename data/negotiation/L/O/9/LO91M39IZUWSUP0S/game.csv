"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to its value to you. I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and allows us both to make a decent profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for less than $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's still a great deal for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows you to make a good profit while still getting me a great deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $925,000.
