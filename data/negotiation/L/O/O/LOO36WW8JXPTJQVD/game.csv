"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $13,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would be a good price point for me.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going below $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a great price for you, and I'm willing to make some concessions to reach an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,3,
