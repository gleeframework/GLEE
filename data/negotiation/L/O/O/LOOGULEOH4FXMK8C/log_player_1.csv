Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is really too low for this product. It's worth significantly more. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firm on $12,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk Bob walking away."
