Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's closer to Bob's maximum but still leaves you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** You frame the price as ""fair"" and highlight the ""benefits"" to encourage Bob to see the value.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a walk-away point in mind (anything below $1,500,000).
* **John as Leverage (Subtlety is Key):**  While you shouldn't explicitly threaten to go to John, you can subtly imply you have other options if Bob doesn't agree. For example, you could say something like, ""I've had significant interest in this product...""

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
