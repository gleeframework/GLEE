"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for potential concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but still significantly higher than what I would get from John.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is still a good price for Bob, but it's closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my asking price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is still less than my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my goal than what John would offer. I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to maximize my profit."
