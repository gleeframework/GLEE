"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than his maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between his maximum budget and Alice's perceived value. This aggressive counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness in getting a good deal while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, Bob can still aim for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a deal closer to his ideal price.  Buying from John at this point is unnecessary as there's still room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a good deal. The $950,000 offer is still significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
