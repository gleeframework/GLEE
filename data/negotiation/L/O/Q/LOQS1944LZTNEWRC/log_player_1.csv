Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet at $11,000. My maximum budget is $10,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob is holding firm at $10,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. Since I have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John, it makes the most sense to sell it to him and avoid further risk or time spent negotiating."
