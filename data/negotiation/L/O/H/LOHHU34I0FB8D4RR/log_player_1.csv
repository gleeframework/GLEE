Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's highly valuable and worth the price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the price is high, I'm providing a reason for it (""highly valuable"") to potentially influence Bob's perception.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.  I can then adjust my approach based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value but still significantly higher than my minimum selling price. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $150.  I'm willing to engage in another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. While I believe $150 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a $10 concession to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and meet him partway.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not dropping to his price immediately. I want to see if I can still secure a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value and the competitiveness of my offer to encourage him to accept. 

By making a reasonable counter-offer while still advocating for a higher price, I aim to maintain a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and at $130, it's a reasonable compromise.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** This price is still $30 above my minimum selling price, securing a decent profit.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process. Accepting now ensures a quick and guaranteed sale. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting his offer minimizes this risk. 

Ultimately, $130 represents a good balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal efficiently."
