"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,500.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow me to continue selling my product at a reasonable price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
