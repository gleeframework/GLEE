Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree this product is impressive, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
