"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree this product is impressive, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
