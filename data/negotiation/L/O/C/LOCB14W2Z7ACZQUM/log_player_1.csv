Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It leaves you room to potentially lower the price a bit if necessary. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  This helps keep the negotiation positive and avoids scaring Bob off."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me there?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $108 is a fair price. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

While $108 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $108 is closer, but I'm really hoping to get $110 for it. It's a fantastic product and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really don't think it's worth $110. $107 is my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is still below my minimum of $120. While I could counteroffer again, I've already made several concessions, and I'm confident that I can get my full asking price from John.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible outcome in this situation."
