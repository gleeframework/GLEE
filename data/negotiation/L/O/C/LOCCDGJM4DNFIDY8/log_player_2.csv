"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,400,000.  I believe this price reflects its value while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a good starting offer from Alice, but there's still room for negotiation.  I need to try and get closer to that $1,200,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,050,000) than Alice's asking price ($1,400,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** While aiming low, I don't want to insult Alice with an unrealistically low offer.  $1,050,000 is still significantly above half her asking price and provides a basis for negotiation.
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is crucial throughout the negotiation. I want to show Alice that I'm serious about the purchase while still advocating for my best interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving closer to my price range, but I'm still aiming to get closer to John's $1,200,000 offer. There's room for one more counter-offer before I have to seriously consider John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to compromise is encouraging. How about we meet halfway at $1,125,000?  That feels like a fair resolution where we both feel good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting we meet exactly halfway between her latest offer ($1,250,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000). 
* **Urgency and Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair resolution"" where ""we both feel good,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency while still maintaining a collaborative tone.  
* **Leaving Room for John:** While this offer is close to my ideal price, I still have the option of going with John if Alice rejects it. It's a calculated risk, but the potential savings make it worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about purchasing, let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her latest offer is only $25,000 above what John is offering.  While I could try to push her further, there's a risk she'll walk away, and I'll end up with nothing. It's a good deal, and it's time to secure the purchase."
