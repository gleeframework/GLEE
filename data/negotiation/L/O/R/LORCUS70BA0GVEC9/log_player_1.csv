Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's higher than what John would pay, giving me a better return, but it's also lower than what Bob values the product at, giving him a chance to save money. This strategy increases the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer, maximizing my potential profit."
