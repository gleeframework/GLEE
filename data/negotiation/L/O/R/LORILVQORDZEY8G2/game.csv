"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. I'm willing to offer you $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal work. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still too far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
