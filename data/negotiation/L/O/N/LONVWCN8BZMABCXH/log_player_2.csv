"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in buying it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and also less than buying from John for $120.  This saves you money."
