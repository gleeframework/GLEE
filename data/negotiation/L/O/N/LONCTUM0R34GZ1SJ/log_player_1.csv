{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, leaving room for negotiation.  It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product without immediately giving away the full $10,000.  This sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could potentially get me a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on this product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly what John is offering.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
