While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'll reject and make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.

While $16,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. I'm confident I can get the product for my target price of $10,000 from John, so I'll take that deal instead."
