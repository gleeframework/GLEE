Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is still a significant discount for Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $100,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers and compromise.
* **It's less than my minimum acceptable price:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal if Bob doesn't accept.

I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better deal. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintains a reasonable profit margin:** $875,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving forward:** It encourages Bob to continue discussing the offer and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $862,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $862,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to meet my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still room for compromise. By rejecting this offer, I can send a counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $862,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $868,750. This is a very fair price, considering we're both close to finding common ground. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 868750}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:**  It demonstrates a genuine attempt to reach a compromise.
* **Is a reasonable middle ground:**  It's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Increases the pressure on Bob:** It signals that I'm serious about getting a good price, but also that I'm open to finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'll meet you at $860,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and the negotiations seem to be stalling. Given the risk of further haggling and potential for a deadlock, it's best to secure the sale with John at $1,000,000. This ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids any further delays or uncertainties."
