Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **It's less than Bob's maximum:** This incentivizes him to accept, knowing he'll still gain a profit. 
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary fluff. 

Remember, you can adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your willingness to keep negotiating. You also have the safety net of selling to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired price point. You have the leverage to push for a higher price, especially considering the product's value to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still below my acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're not giving up on your desired profit margin. 

By using a strong message that emphasizes the value for Bob, you're hoping to secure a deal that's advantageous for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've considered my budget and am willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below the value you've placed on the product. You still have room to negotiate and there's a significant difference between your current offer and Bob's. You have the leverage to push for a higher price, especially considering the product's value to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a profitable agreement.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small step towards Bob's offer:** Shows you're willing to compromise while still prioritizing your profit.
* **Emphasizes the value for Bob:** Reminds him of the significant benefit he'll gain from the product.
* **Frames it as a final offer:**  Creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

Remember, you're still above your minimum, but you're also getting closer to a deal that benefits both parties."
