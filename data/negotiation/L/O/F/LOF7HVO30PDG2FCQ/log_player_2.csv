"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product for sale. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can get the product for less than $110 from Alice, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

Alice is still asking for more than your maximum price. While it's closer, you can likely still negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to $110. I'll meet you at $112.50, and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $112.50 is within your budget of $120 and is closer to your desired price than John's offer. It's a good deal for you, so accepting it makes sense."
