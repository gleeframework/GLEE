"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make it work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $750,000 is getting closer, but I can't go that low.  My final offer is $850,000.  This is a fantastic deal on a valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,5,
