"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but I'm only able to go up to $125.  Let's find a way to make this work.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $150. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However,  $150 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",135.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $150 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",145.0,Alice,7,
