"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
