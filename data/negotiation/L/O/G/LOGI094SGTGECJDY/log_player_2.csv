"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I know it has the potential to be very valuable to you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a fair price, and I'll be able to make a little profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice is offering the product for $12,500, which is more than your maximum budget of $12,000. You know John will sell it to you for $12,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
