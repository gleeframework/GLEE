"Alice, $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. How about $14,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $15,500?  That gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get what we want.  What do you think?",15250.0,Bob,4,
