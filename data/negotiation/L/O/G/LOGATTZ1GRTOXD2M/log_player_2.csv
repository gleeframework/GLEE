"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages her to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, but it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I want to see if I can get her down even further. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to chip away at the price, getting closer to my ideal range. This offer is still above Alice's minimum, but it's also below her previous counteroffer, showing that I'm serious about negotiating a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is within my budget and is a good deal considering the product's value and my previous negotiation efforts. Accepting this offer means saving $420,000 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is not worth it."
