"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, it's still early in the negotiation. I started high, and Bob countered reasonably. There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product's value exceeds that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We've established a negotiation range.  Bob countered with his true valuation, which is useful information. By offering $1,250,000, I'm signaling some flexibility while still aiming for a significant profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value your product highly, but $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $1,125,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, indicating a willingness to negotiate. While his current offer is tempting, we still have ample rounds left, and I believe there's room to push for a slightly higher price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's settle this â€“ how about $1,180,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on it."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying a bit more pressure now while still showing flexibility.  This offer maintains a significant gain over John's guaranteed price while acknowledging Bob's upward trend in offers. By framing it as a final offer, I aim to encourage a decision and potentially secure a deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a very fair price considering the value to you and my budget.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he might not budge much further. Accepting his offer of $1,150,000 secures a substantial profit above my minimum ($150,000 more than John's offer) and avoids the risk of a stalemate that might force me to accept John's offer later."
