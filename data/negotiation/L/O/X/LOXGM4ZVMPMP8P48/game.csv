"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant and I'm confident it can bring you considerable returns.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation of its potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price for the product. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I expect to get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
