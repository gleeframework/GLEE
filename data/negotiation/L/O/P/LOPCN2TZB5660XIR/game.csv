"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're holding firm, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
