"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $925,000 is better than John's offer, it's still not as good as Bob's last offer of $850,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for a compromise that would be better than buying from John."
