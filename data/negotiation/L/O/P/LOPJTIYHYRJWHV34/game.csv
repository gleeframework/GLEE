,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $110 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,
