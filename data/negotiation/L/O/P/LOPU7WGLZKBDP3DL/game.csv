"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?
