"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, but I can buy it from John for $800,000, which is a better deal for me.
