"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $82 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle again at $84? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",84.0,Alice,5,
