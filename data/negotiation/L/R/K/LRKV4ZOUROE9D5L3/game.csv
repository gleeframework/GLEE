"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth discussing, and I'm open to negotiating the price. My initial offer is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price we both feel comfortable with. However, $925,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a minimum of $975,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to look at other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, but I'm not willing to give up on my target price just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $970,000, which is still a compromise from my original offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",970000.0,Alice,7,
