(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

This is a tough call, as you're very close to your minimum. However, there are still 4 rounds left, and Bob is showing willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance you can push for a slightly higher price, especially if Bob is keen on getting the product.  It's a risk, but it could pay off."
