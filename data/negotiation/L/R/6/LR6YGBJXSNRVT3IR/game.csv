"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is around $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is generous, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,025,000. This reflects a more accurate compromise considering its potential worth to both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, while also being reasonable for you.",975000.0,Bob,4,
