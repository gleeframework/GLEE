As we discussed, it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $6,500. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $5,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $6,200. It's getting close to the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",6200.0,Alice,5,
