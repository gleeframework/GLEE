"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and will be tremendously beneficial for you. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uses positive language to create a sense of desirability. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By anchoring the negotiation at a higher price, we aim to influence Bob's counteroffers and secure a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his perceived value.  We have room to negotiate and selling to John would be a last resort. We need to signal that his initial offer is unacceptable and guide the negotiation towards a more favorable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you.  To move this forward, I can go as low as $1,300,000. This represents a substantial discount while still reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We reject Bob's offer outright as it's below our minimum.  By stating our counteroffer as ""as low as"" we're signaling some flexibility but also firmness in our position.
* **Justification:**  We provide a reason for our counteroffer ( undervaluing the product) to make it more convincing.
* **Strategic Movement:**  We moved down $100,000, a significant amount but still well above both our minimum and John's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,300,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches our minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While we might have been able to push for a slightly higher price, accepting now guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
