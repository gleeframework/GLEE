"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about a price of $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $90 is within your budget, you know you can get the product for $100 from John if necessary.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a lower price with her, potentially saving more money."
