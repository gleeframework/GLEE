"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth no more than $10,000 to you, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows my intention to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for compromise. It's important to be bold but also realistic, considering my maximum budget of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have 7 rounds left to reach a deal.  I'm also not willing to accept anything close to Jhon's price.  Continuing to negotiate will allow me to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $6,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want a price lower than Alice's current offer. This is a middle ground that could potentially lead to an agreement. It also allows for further negotiation in the remaining rounds if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's only a small reduction from the previous round, and I'm not willing to accept anything close to Jhon's price. I have 5 rounds left, so I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $6,750. This is a reasonable compromise, considering that Alice has reduced her price slightly, and I'm approaching the middle ground between our current offers.  It's important to demonstrate a willingness to move closer to Alice's price point, but I still have room to negotiate if this counteroffer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much, but we are getting closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to keep negotiating because I'm confident I can get a better deal than $7,300, and I want to avoid buying from John at $10,000. I have only three rounds left, so I need to be strategic and aim for a deal that is both acceptable to me and potentially agreeable to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6900}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final push.  With only two rounds left, I'm increasing my offer to $6,900, a significant move toward Alice's price point. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping that Alice will recognize the seriousness of my intent and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, I have to make a decision. Alice's offer of $7,400 is too high, and it's unlikely she'll budge much further in the final round.  I've reached a point where the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of not getting a deal at all. Buying from John at $10,000 ensures I get the product, and while it's not ideal, it's the most practical option at this stage."
