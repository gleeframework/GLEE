"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $9,000 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500. How about we try $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up a bit more, but $8,750 is still pushing it for me.  How about $8,600 and we call it a deal?",8600.0,Bob,6,
