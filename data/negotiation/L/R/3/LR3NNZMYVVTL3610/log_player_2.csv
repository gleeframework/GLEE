"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly lower than both my maximum price and the product's value to her. This indicates room for negotiation."

Round 2

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to get the price closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $550,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $550,000 is getting closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $520,000.  Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 520000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $520,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $530,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $530,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $530,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is making smaller concessions, suggesting we're approaching her bottom line. Accepting at $530,000 secures a significant discount while avoiding the risk of her withdrawing from the negotiation entirely."
