Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, a strong incentive to accept. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John if Bob declines, so there's limited risk in aiming high."
