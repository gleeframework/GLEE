"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential range.  I'll be watching closely to see if he accepts, rejects, or counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price of $1,200,000, and we're already in round 4.  I don't want to risk losing this deal to John or spending too many rounds to squeeze out a little more. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and closes the deal quickly."
