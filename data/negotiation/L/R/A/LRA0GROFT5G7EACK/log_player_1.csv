Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he's willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer who will pay $100. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. Bob's interest indicates he might be willing to go a bit higher. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate and move closer to Bob's price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By suggesting a price slightly above the midpoint between your initial offer and his counteroffer, you leave room for further negotiation but also signal that you're not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Increase:**  While you could try to negotiate further, Bob's offer is now only $5 less than your counteroffer. It might not be worth the risk of losing the sale over a small difference. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate means delaying the sale. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit.
* **Relationship Building:**  Meeting Bob partway demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could lead to positive future interactions."
