"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! My starting price is $170.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly above what I think Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message upbeat and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hard price in the first round, allowing for a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $150, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. It's possible I can get closer to my desired price.
* **I want to test Bob's willingness to pay:** By rejecting his offer, I can gauge how committed he is to buying the product and if he's willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport.
* **Testing the waters:** I'm gauging Bob's response to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  While I could sell to John for $150, Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **Assessing Bob's commitment:** By rejecting his offer, I'm pushing Bob to consider if he's truly serious about buying the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $155, but this is my final offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer to create pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Close to my minimum:**  $155 is only slightly below my minimum, so it's still a good deal for me.
* **Framing it as a choice:**  By saying ""What do you think?"" I'm placing the ball in Bob's court and giving him the impression that the decision is his."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I don't need to risk further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time pressure:**  With only four rounds remaining, there isn't enough time to potentially get a better offer from Bob. It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
