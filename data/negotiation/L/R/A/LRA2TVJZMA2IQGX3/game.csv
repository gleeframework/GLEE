"I understand your position, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This product will truly benefit you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. However, $7,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  What if we settle at $8,250? That's my final offer.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't go that high.  I'd be willing to do $7,750. That's the best I can offer.",7750.0,Bob,6,
