Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?,85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I was thinking more along the lines of 92. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $92 is still a little more than my budget allows. How about $88?  It's a fair compromise and would allow us to make a deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below 90. How about we meet in the middle at 90? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $90 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really close to my budget at $88.  Would you be willing to meet me there?  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below 89. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. How about we meet at 89?",89.0,Alice,7,
