"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1350000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the worth of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). I want to try to get closer to that value. I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to increase his price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,375,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with $1360000. I believe this is a reasonable price given the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point.  While I would prefer a higher price, I've only got six rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good return.  It's also possible that if I reject this offer, Bob may become less willing to negotiate further, and I could end up selling to John for a significantly lower price."
