"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600000 is simply too low. This product is worth significantly more to you.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the value you'll get from the product while also allowing me to reach a fair deal. Let's make this work.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  $900000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair compromise, given the significant value this product holds for you. Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, which is the highest I can go. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. $850000 is a fair offer, but I'm still a little away from my target price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950000.  This price reflects the product's value to you and gives us both a chance to close this deal.  Let's make it happen.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  $825000 is a good offer, but I need a little more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price is a final compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's close this deal now!",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,10,
