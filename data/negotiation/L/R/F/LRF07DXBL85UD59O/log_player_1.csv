"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product offers Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not starting at the maximum possible price, I allow space for Bob to counter without me immediately feeling like I've lost out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, as he has already expressed interest. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous price ($100) and Bob's offer ($70). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value to Bob by saying it's still a great deal.
* **Clarifying Needs:** I subtly explain why I need a higher price (""closer to what I need to get for the product""). 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a sense of fairness:**  It's reasonable to split the difference in the first counteroffer.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm hoping to avoid another rejection and get closer to a deal.
* **Signal commitment:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I also have limits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We are already in round 4, so I have fewer rounds left to negotiate a better price.
* **Potential for counteroffer:** I think I can likely get a better offer from Bob with another counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:** I'm going to counteroffer with something slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $80?  It's my absolute minimum, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering $80, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($85) and Bob's offer ($75). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  The message adds a bit of urgency by saying ""Let's get this deal done!"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** I reiterate that $80 is my absolute minimum, signaling that I'm not willing to go lower.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're in round 5 now, so time is running out. I need to secure a deal that meets my minimum while also considering the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and ending up with nothing.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $80, I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible.  Bob values the product more, and negotiating with him might lead to a higher final price.
* **Bob's Interest:**  Bob has expressed continued interest, which gives me a bit of leverage.  I'm hoping he'll recognize the value and accept my offer."
