"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay and significantly higher than its value to her. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while staying under my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $85 is still above my target price. I'll reject and counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

I'm holding firm on my previous counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about my budget while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $80?  It's my absolute minimum, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met her minimum price, which aligns with her product valuation. It's unlikely she'll go lower. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price well below my maximum budget."
