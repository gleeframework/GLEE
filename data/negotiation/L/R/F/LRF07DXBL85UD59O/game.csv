"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $80?  It's my absolute minimum, and I think it's still a great value for you. Let's get this deal done!",80.0,Alice,5,
