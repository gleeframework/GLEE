Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer. 
* **Is a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to consider the offer without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than your minimum, there's still room for improvement. You're better off trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more for my product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $85 is still less than what you initially hoped for, it is more than John's offer of $80. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a broken deal with Bob."
