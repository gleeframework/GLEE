Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer gauges Bob's interest and financial capacity. His response will guide your next move.
* **Justification:** While the price is significantly higher than your minimum, framing it as reflecting the product's ""worth and potential"" can make it seem more palatable. 

**Important Note:**  Be prepared to negotiate! Bob is likely to counter-offer. Having a strategy for reaching a mutually agreeable price while maximizing your profit is key."
