"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $110 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 isn't quite working for me.  Let's try $105.  It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $105 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,90.0,Bob,6,
