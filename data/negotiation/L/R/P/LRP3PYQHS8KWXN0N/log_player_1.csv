Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 110}

```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offers are consistently lower than my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  It's better to guarantee a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
