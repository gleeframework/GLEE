"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $9,750?  That's a fair offer considering the market value.",9750.0,Bob,4,
