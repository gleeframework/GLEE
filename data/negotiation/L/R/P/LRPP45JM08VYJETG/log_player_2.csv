"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a decent price and lower than Alice's value, there's room for negotiation. You know you have a backup option at $10,000, so it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest while clearly stating the price is too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting lower, you aim to bring Alice closer to your desired price range.  Even if she rejects this offer, it gives you a better starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but she's still above your ideal price and your backup option. There's no harm in pushing a bit further, especially since she seems motivated to sell.  You're willing to walk away if she doesn't budge, but there's a good chance of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $9,750?  That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Justification:** Mentioning a ""tight budget"" and ""market value"" reinforces your position without being confrontational.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will reveal how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she accepts, you've saved money. If she rejects it, you can consider going up slightly or taking John's offer."
