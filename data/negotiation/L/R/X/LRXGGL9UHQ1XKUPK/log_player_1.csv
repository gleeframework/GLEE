Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring the deal is still highly appealing.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but we have a comfortable buffer before reaching our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value *to Bob*, making the price feel more justified."
