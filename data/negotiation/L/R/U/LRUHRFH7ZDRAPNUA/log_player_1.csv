"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I have 10 rounds and I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. It's worth continuing to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer is possible:**  I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,400,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but leaving the door open for negotiation.
* **Counter with a smaller reduction:** I'm reducing my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm re-emphasizing the value to Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect of the offer.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm using phrases like ""find a solution"" to encourage Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,350,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** While it's tempting to take the offer to avoid selling to John, I still have time to negotiate.
* **Opportunity to increase the price:** With more rounds, I might be able to get closer to my desired value or convince Bob to increase his offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going, hoping to achieve a better outcome in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,350,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but emphasizing my willingness to compromise. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest one, showing flexibility. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the ""great deal"" the product represents for him.
* **Urgency and closing:**  I'm creating a sense of urgency by implying this might be my final offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiations are stalling:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 6, and there's a high probability that Bob will continue to offer lower prices. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum requirement. It's a safe and sure way to secure a good profit.

While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I've reached a point where the risk of further negotiations outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John ensures a certain profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower sale price."
