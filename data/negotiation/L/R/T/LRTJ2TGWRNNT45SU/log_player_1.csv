Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $100 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $99 is a common negotiation tactic. It's slightly below the ""premium"" price, making Bob feel like they're getting a good deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject $99. However, I'm guaranteed $100 from John, so the potential loss is only $1.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while considering Bob's perceived value and my guaranteed alternative."
