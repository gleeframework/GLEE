I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum of $150, but it's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell to John for $150, I'm not willing to settle for Bob's offer just yet. I think there's room to negotiate. I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $175.  This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is close enough to my minimum and allows me to make a profit.  I'm going to accept his offer and move on."
