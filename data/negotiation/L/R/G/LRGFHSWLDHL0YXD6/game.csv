,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $85 for it?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me cover my costs.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $88?,88.0,Bob,6,
