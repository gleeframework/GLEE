"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind. Could you do $15,000? It's a fairer reflection of the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $14,250?  It's a compromise that recognizes the value of the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $14,250 is still a bit above my limit. I'm happy to pay $13,750. Let's try to close this deal.",13750.0,Bob,6,
