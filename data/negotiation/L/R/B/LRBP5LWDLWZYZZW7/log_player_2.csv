Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. That's the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice is very unlikely to go below $11,500. It's better to secure the product from John at the desired price of $10,000."
