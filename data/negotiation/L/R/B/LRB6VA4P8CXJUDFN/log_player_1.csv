{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. I believe this price reflects its worth to you as well. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to earn a good profit. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my counteroffers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer Bob, hoping to push the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $950,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm confident that John will pay the full amount, so I'll choose to sell the product to John to ensure I get my desired profit."
