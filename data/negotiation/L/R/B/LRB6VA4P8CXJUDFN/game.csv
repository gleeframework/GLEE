"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. I believe this price reflects its worth to you as well. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you is $1,500,000 and I'm willing to pay up to $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair profit for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
