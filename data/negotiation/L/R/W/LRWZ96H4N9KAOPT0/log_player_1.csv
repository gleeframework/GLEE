{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still below my minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation without immediately pushing him away. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to make the offer more appealing. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll consider his counteroffer and my options.  If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer.  If it's still too low or the negotiation seems unproductive, I'll move on to John and sell him the product for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer to try and find a price that works for both of us.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but it also limits my potential earnings. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll be flexible but firm in my stance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price in the middle of our two previous offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** I'm framing the price as ""fair for both of us,"" making it more appealing to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll happily sell him the product for $105. 
* **Rejecting:** If Bob rejects, I'll consider his next offer. If it's still too low, I'll either make another counteroffer or consider selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about $97? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to increase his offer. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, but it also limits my potential earnings. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price between $97 and my minimum price of $120. I'll continue to be flexible but firm in my stance, highlighting the value of the product to justify my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $4, showing that I'm willing to compromise but not giving away too much.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting:** If Bob accepts, I'll happily sell him the product for $101.
