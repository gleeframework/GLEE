You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97. That's getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $101?  It's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $100. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $100 price."
