"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  How about $97? That's a pretty significant jump from my last offer.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97. That's getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $101?  It's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product.",101.0,Alice,5,
