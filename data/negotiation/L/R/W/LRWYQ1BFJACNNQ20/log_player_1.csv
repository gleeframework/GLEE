Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly is preferable to John because it's likely faster and involves less hassle (like finding another buyer).

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, achieving a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
