"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make you a fair offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to compromise to get us off on the right foot. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to give you a bit more room to maneuver. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. ",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1,025,000, which is my final offer. I've already given you a significant discount, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
