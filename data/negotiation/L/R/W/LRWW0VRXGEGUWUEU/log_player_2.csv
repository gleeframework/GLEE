"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $12,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming to get a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still room for Alice to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to her while still getting a better deal than $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $10,750 is still a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $15,000. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has made a significant compromise from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  Rejecting Alice's offer could lead to a stalemate or a higher price if she becomes less willing to negotiate. 

It's a good move for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price within his budget."
