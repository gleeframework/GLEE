"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. While I value it at significantly more than $1,500,000, I'm willing to consider your perspective and start our negotiation at $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from my true valuation, and I believe it represents a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This would still give you a significant saving compared to my original asking price and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
