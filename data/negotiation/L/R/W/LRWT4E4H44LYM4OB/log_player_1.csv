While I value it at significantly more than $1,500,000, I'm willing to consider your perspective and start our negotiation at $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the discount you've offered, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. To make this work for me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This would still give you a significant saving compared to my original asking price and allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
