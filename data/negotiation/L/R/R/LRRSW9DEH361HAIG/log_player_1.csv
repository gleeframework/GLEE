Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept your offer. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a lower offer, but the key is to aim higher than your guaranteed sale price to John."
