"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's work together to finalize this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,100,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant discount from my original price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this transaction now.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
