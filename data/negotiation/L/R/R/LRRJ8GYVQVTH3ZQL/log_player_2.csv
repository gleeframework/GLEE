Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the initial price.  While $1,300,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both.  Considering that, I could come down to $975,000. This offer still reflects the significant value this product holds. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $700,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has substantial value beyond what you're currently offering. I'm willing to consider $875,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her last offer of $875,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000."
