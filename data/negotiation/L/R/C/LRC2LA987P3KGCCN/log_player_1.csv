{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I would have liked to get more, Bob is insistent on his $100 offer, and I've already lowered my price.  At this point, I'm worried the negotiation will go on for too long and I'll miss out on a guaranteed sale.  John offers me a fair price, so I'm going to take it."
