Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $720,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $900,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction and a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer."
