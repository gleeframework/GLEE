"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $975,000 is still a bit much. I could go up to $720,000. What do you say?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $720,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $900,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant reduction and a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,5,
