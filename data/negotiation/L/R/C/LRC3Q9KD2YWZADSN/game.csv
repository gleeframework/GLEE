"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that $120 is a tough limit for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
