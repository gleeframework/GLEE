"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our perspectives.
