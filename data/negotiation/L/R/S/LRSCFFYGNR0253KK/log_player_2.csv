Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,012? This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly signalling this is her final offer, and while you could likely negotiate a tiny bit lower, the difference is getting insignificant and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal.  $12,012 is a good price compared to your alternative options."
