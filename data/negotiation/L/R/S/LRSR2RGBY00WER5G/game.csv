"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its quality and features. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $80?  It's my top offer.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Would you be open to considering $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. Would you be willing to come down to $95?  That's the absolute most I can do.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference. Would you accept $100? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
