{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation. I can adjust the price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still keeping the price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price."
