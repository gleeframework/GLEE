Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $17,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still recognizing the value of what you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer of $17,000 is better than risking him walking away and only getting $15,000 from John."
