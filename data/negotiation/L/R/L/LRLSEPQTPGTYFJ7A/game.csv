"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a great price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
