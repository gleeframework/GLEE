Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as related to the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly implying it might be worth even more to the right buyer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $1,000,000 gives me a strong position. I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I see the potential in this product, my budget is capped at $800,000. To make progress, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the value I place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a substantial loss. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and steer the negotiation closer to a more acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and I can't let it go for that price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've lowered my price by $150,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum, aiming to keep the negotiation anchored closer to my desired range.
* **No Justification:** I'm avoiding further justifications for the price at this stage.  Over-explaining can weaken my position.
* **Pressure:**  The clock is implicitly ticking, as Bob knows I have an alternative buyer. This might encourage him to make a more serious offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum. While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer to a point that would be acceptable to me. I have a guaranteed offer from John at my minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most financial sense to cut off negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
