"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is too low for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130, which is still above my minimum but a bit lower than my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a more reasonable price and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is still lower than I'd hoped for, it's getting close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the deal to John and getting only $120, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
