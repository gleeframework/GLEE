Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.  Can we meet halfway at $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to both of us.  How about we settle at $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price that acknowledges its worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While I could push for more, Bob landing at my minimum acceptable price makes accepting the offer the safest and most logical choice."
