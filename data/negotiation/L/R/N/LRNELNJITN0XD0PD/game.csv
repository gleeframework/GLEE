"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves you with a good margin for profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,750.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,875. That's a fair compromise and it leaves both of us with a good deal. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
