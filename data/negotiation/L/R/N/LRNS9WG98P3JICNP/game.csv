"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my maximum limit. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair price. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
