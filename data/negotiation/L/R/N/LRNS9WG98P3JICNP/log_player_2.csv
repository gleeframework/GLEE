"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal, or I can always buy from John for $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is only $50,000 more than my maximum budget. While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  Given that buying from John will cost me $800,000, it's worth it to accept Alice's offer and save the hassle of additional negotiation."
