"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the market demand.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $12,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12750.0,Alice,5,
