Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your ideal price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, we create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While we don't want to undervalue the product to Bob, we avoid explicitly stating why it's worth so much to us. This keeps the focus on his perceived value.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. However, since we have John as a guaranteed backup at $15,000, we can afford to aim higher with Bob."
