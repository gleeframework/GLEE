Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to reach a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175, which is still above my minimum but demonstrates a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, since John is also offering the same price, and the negotiation seems to be going nowhere, I will sell the product to John. There is no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as it is unlikely he will offer anything higher."
