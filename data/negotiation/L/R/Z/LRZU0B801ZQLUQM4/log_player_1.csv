Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I'd like to offer you. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
