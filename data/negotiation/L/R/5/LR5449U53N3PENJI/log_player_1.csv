Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, without going below your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a significant profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no pressure to accept a lower offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale at your desired price."
