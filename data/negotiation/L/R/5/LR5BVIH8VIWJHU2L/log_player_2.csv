Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than Alice values the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He has room to negotiate for a better price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, Alice has come down to a price that's only $50,000 above his maximum willingness to pay.  He's likely to save more time and effort by accepting this offer, rather than risking that Alice won't budge further or that he'll lose the product to another buyer."
