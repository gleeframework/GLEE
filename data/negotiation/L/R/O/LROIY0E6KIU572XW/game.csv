"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8500. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9500.  That's still a good price for you, and allows me to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $9000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
