"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if I can get it for less. There are 9 more rounds, and I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $50,000 drop from her initial offer is a reasonable starting point.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price without risking her walking away too early."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm now only $25,000 away from my goal, and there's a risk of her becoming less willing to negotiate as the rounds progress.  Accepting her offer allows me to secure a good deal without risking losing the opportunity entirely."
