"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $95, but I really think the product is worth more than that to you. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would get us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to meet me in the middle, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $90. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we try $92.50? That's a bit more than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",92.5,Alice,5,
