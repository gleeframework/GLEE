"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $8,500. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
