"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This shows my commitment to buying the product from you, and I hope we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
