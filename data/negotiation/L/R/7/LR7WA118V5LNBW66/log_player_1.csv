"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to find a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects outright, we can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,500,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe we can do better. Bob's initial offer is too low, and I want to see if we can find a middle ground. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm offering $1,800,000 as a counteroffer.  This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $1,600,000. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement and only $100,000 less than my counteroffer. I'm happy to accept this offer and move forward with the sale."
