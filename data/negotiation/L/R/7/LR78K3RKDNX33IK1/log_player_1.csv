Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's value is $120, he might be willing to go slightly higher. Starting at $135 leaves room for potential negotiation or a counter-offer.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Your Minimum:** This price ensures that if Bob accepts, you get more than his perceived value ($120), while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:**  You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
