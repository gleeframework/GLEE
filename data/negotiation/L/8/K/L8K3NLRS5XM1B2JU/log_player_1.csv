Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant profit for me but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob would get by stating the product is worth $15,000 to him. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not making a hard-line offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:**  My minimum selling price is $8,000, and Bob's offer of $10,000 is still a significant loss for me. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob. He is interested in the product, and a counteroffer could lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm not accepting Bob's offer, I'm not selling to John yet. Selling to John is a last resort if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not significantly. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product. 
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing that he's still getting a good deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum selling price of $8,000, ensuring I get a decent profit.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While I'd prefer more, $9,500 is very close to my minimum selling price of $8,000. 
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $8,000.
* **Time factor:** Continued negotiations could take longer, and I need to consider the value of my time.

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option to secure a sale and a decent profit."
