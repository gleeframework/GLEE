"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  $11,500 is a good price, but it's still more than Bob's ideal price of $10,000. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to see if Bob can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I can do $11,800, which is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,800 is closer to Bob's desired price of $10,000.  However, Bob is still hoping for a lower price. He has five rounds left and can still try to negotiate a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob the chance to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $11,200. I think this is a good compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11200} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is the best price Bob has been offered so far, and it's significantly lower than the $15,000 he could pay John. 

With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob can negotiate a better price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob the product at a reasonable price and prevents him from having to pay the higher price to John."
