"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can do $11,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I can do $11,800, which is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",11800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $11,200. I think this is a good compromise that works for both of us.",11200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that we've been negotiating for a while. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
