"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I'm confident it's a price that makes sense for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage a better deal, ideally closer to your $800,000 limit."
