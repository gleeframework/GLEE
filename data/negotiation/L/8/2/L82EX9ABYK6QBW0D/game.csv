"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done some research and I think it's worth that much to me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  Let's try $110 again.  It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  I'm flexible on this, but I can't go any lower than that.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. How about we meet at $108? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $110. That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,7,
