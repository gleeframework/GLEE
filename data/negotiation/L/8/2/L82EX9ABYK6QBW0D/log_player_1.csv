"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** I'm not aiming for an immediate deal, as I want to see if I can push the price higher. 
* **Considering John:**  I'm keeping John's $120 offer in mind, so I won't settle for anything below that."

Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm confident in negotiating:** I have 9 rounds left and can counter-offer, potentially pushing the price closer to my goal. 
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed $120 offer from John, so I can afford to be patient with Bob."
