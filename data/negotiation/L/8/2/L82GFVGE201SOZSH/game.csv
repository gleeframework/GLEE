"I'm interested in the product, but I think $750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $650000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650000 is still a bit below my minimum. Considering the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700000. This is a fair price considering the unique features and advantages of the product.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $700000. I'm willing to pay $680000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's unique features and the value it brings, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $690000. This is as low as I can go without compromising the product's value.",690000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $680000, just like I offered in round 4. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",680000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to compromise further. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than its true value. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $695000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",695000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $695000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm making a final counteroffer of $675000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",675000.0,Bob,8,
