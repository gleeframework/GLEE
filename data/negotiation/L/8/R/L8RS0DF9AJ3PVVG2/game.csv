"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $110 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Could you do $125? That's a fair compromise, I think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our negotiation, but $125 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle at $135. I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",135.0,Alice,5,
