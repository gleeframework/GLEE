{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price, considering my minimum is $120 and I'm willing to negotiate.  This price also leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which gives us a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering Bob a counteroffer of $95. This is a compromise, and still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is close enough to my minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures I avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
