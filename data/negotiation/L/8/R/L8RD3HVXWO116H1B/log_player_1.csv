"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really looking to pay closer to $80. Would you be willing to do $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $120. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $95. This is still below my minimum price of $120 but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up slightly in his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still trying to stay around $80.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $120. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

I'm offering $98, which is still a bit below my minimum but close to Bob's last offer.  This should encourage Bob to accept or at least come up slightly in his next counteroffer."
