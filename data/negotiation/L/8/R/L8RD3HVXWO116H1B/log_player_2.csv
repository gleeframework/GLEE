"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to pay no more than $80, and Alice's offer is too high.  You can do better!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really looking to pay closer to $80. Would you be willing to do $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. You're still aiming for a price closer to $80, and $95 is too high. You can try another counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still trying to stay around $80.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy the product from John for $80. You've already rejected several offers from Alice, and while she is lowering the price, it seems she's not willing to come down to the $80 range you're aiming for. Since you have 10 rounds to close the deal, and you have a guaranteed option for $80, there's no reason to continue the negotiation."
