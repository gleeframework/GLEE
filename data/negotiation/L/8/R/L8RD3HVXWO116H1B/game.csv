"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still trying to stay around $80.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is still below what I can reasonably accept. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
