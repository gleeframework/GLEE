"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. It's a fantastic deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a quick deal while ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent price, I can likely do better. I will counter Bob's offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget, I am comfortable paying $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still within my 10 rounds and can try to squeeze a little more out of the deal.  I'll counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go down to $101.50, but I really can't go any lower. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 101.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer. I am willing to pay $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting repetitive, and Bob seems firm at $100.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed profit and closer to my minimum desired price."
