"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below the product's value to me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find some common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $850,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $775,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but I'm still at $825,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value to you.  I'm eager to close this deal, but I can't go any lower than this. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $790,000?  That's a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $790,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can squeeze out a bit more. It's a good offer, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
