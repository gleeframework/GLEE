"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would allow us to both gain something from the transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $900,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $980,000. I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and takes into account our previous discussions.",980000.0,Alice,5,
