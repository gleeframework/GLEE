""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be incredibly valuable for your needs. I'm asking for $1,400,000 to start. I think it's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep.  How about we start the conversation at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still a significant way off from my target price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent this early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking for a price that more accurately reflects the value this product brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be completely transparent, I'm working with a tight budget on this purchase.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is definitely interested and getting closer, but I believe I have more room to negotiate before considering John's offer.  I'll aim for a smaller concession this round to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle at $1,175,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $1,125,000, but that's really pushing my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and has moved closer to my price with each round.  While I could push for a bit more, accepting his offer at $1,125,000 secures a significant profit without risking the deal by pushing him too far."
