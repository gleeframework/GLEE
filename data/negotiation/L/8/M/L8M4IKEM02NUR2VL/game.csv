"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal happen. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in this product.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a little below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it offers a good value for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that allows us to both succeed.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $975,000 again. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
