"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
