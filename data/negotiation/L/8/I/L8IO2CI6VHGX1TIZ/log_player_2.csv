"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as this is the maximum I can realistically afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for this round, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's come down, it's still significantly above my budget and what the product is worth to me.  It makes sense to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I can see you're serious. Let's make this work â€“ I'm willing to drop to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  It's worth pushing for a lower price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
