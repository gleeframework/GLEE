,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as this is the maximum I can realistically afford. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer for this round, and I believe it's a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I can see you're serious. Let's make this work â€“ I'm willing to drop to $1,750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a substantial amount, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
