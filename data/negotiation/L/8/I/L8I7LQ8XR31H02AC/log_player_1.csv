"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  My asking price is $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Confidence:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price. 
* **More rounds available:** I have 9 rounds left and can counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $14,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a firm price:** I'm not budging below my minimum value, but offering a compromise. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion.
* **Framing the offer:**  ""Middle ground"" suggests a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $12000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting minimum value:** Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum required value for the product.
* **Time is running out:** We are already on round 4, and while I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better deal.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds that might result in a lower price or even no deal."
