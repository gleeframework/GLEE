"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant difference between Alice's valuation ($1,500,000) and her offer ($1,200,000), indicating room for negotiation.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your ideal price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within her likely range, considering her valuation. It's a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for further compromise.  It also demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but are committed to getting the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While still above your target of $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer at $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a better price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, leaving you to buy from John at a higher price.  

The $100,000 difference between Alice's current offer and John's price isn't substantial enough to warrant the risk of further negotiation."
