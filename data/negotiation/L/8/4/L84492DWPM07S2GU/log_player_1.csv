"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially earn a profit.  I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth more to me to keep negotiating, as there are still several rounds left.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  There's still time to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still below my minimum. Let's try $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired amount."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
