"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's quite a bit more than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a limited budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer it to you for $18,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
