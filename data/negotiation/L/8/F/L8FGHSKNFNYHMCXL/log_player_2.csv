"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for a significantly reduced price. Consider this a special opportunity.  Let's talk about a price of $1,200,000.  It's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
