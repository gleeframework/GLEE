"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers unique value that I believe justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offer at $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
