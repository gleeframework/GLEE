"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product will generate significant value for your business. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

"Bob, I hear you. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm proposing $875,000. This compromise shows my commitment to a deal, while still reflecting the product's true worth.  What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
