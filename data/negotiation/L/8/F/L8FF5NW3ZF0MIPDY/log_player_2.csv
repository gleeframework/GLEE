"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a valuable asset with the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm confident it's worth $1,000,000 to you, as I've carefully considered your needs and its potential impact.  To start, I'm offering it for $950,000.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000) and is only slightly lower than the price Bob could pay to John.  There is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to pay a price that reflects the product's actual value.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price that is halfway between Alice's offer and the product's worth to her. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** It shows Bob is serious about buying but also wants a fair deal. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** It allows for further back-and-forth to hopefully reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm confident this product will generate significant value for your business. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $900,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000).  
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  
* **Time is on his side:**  He has several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into an agreement that isn't in his best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value this product can bring, $900,000 is still outside my desired range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stand firm:** Bob is sticking to his previous offer, demonstrating his commitment to getting a good price. 
* **Reaffirming value:**  He acknowledges the potential value but still believes his offer is fair.
* **Open to compromise:**  The message keeps the door open for further discussion and a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm proposing $875,000. This compromise shows my commitment to a deal, while still reflecting the product's true worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, and the offer is now only $25,000 above the product's worth to her. 
* **Significant savings:** This deal would save Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching an impasse is too high.  It's better to take the deal now."
