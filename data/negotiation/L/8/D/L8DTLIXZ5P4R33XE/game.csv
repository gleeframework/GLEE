"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
