"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I should try to get a lower price from Alice. $12,000 is a significant markup from her $10,000 valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to meet close to the middle ground between Alice's starting price and my ideal target. Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, I think there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

We're getting closer to a deal! This counter-offer splits the difference of our last offers and keeps the negotiation moving. Hopefully, Alice sees this as a sign of good faith."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! Alice is holding firm, and this price is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000. It's time to accept and finalize the purchase."
