Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is your hard limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It's time to walk away.  Alice has made it clear she won't go below $125, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $120. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
