"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in paying $90 for it?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $100 to John, which is your maximum value for the product.  While you'd save $10 by accepting Alice's offer, it's still more expensive than your other option."
