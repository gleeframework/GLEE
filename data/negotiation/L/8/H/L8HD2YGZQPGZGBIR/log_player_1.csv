# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal. I'm confident in the value of my product and don't want to settle for a price that doesn't reflect that."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,900 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, and I believe that would be a fair price that we can both be happy with. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. With only 4 rounds left, it's more likely that Bob will not increase his offer further, and I risk losing out on a good deal by rejecting. Additionally, selling to John for $8,000 would net me less. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategic decision at this point."
