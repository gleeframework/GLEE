Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's still better to see if we can negotiate further down before taking her up on $8,500."

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $7,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I hope you can see the value in taking it.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice has met your target price. There's no point in rejecting and risking her increasing the price again.  You're happy with the deal!"
