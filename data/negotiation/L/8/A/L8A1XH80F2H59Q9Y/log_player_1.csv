Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm excited to make an offer to Bob!

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the minimum value I have in mind, hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $10,000. Since this is the minimum value I have in mind for the product, I think I'll choose option (1):

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $10,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to finalize the sale!"
