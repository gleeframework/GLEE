Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $110, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $130.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget of $120 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
