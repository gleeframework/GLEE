"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $105? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $105. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to keep costs low.",95.0,Bob,4,
