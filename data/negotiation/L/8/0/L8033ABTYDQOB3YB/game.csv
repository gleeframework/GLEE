"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I think you'll find it very attractive. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your best price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is significantly closer to my budget and reflects the value I place on this product. I believe this is a fair offer considering we're both looking for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I think it's a fair one. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  To make this deal work, I can only offer $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll need to consider purchasing from John instead. ",900000.0,Bob,6,
