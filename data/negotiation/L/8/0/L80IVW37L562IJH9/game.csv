"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is too far below my value. How about $11,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be.  How about $11,500?  This would split the difference between our last offers and give us both a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $11,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10750.0,Bob,6,
