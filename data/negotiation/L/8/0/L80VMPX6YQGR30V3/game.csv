"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's try to make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $115, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a middle ground. I'll give you a deal at $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,5,
