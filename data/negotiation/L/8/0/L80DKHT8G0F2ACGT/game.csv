"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, a steal considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I need to make a profit. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? That's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $9,750, but that's my final concession. I think you'll really love the product and it's worth every penny.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's the absolute highest I can go.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise at $9,750, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth an extra $250. That way, you'll get even more value out of the product. The new price is $10,000, which is still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
