"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation, and it's likely he'll counteroffer. It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is more than what I would get from John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my target of $1,150,000. This offer is likely to be more appealing to Bob than his previous offer while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can reach a more favorable deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $975,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to accept the offer. I'm still comfortable with this price, as it's higher than what I would get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is offering a lower price, but I still believe I can get closer to my target. We're nearing the midpoint of the negotiation, and it's getting riskier to sell to John, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, lowering my price again to $930,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price that balances my need to secure a good deal with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting risky, as I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are getting lower. While I'd like to keep negotiating, I'm concerned that I'll end up with a price that's too low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000.  This ensures I get a good deal and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
