"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to consider a price that benefits us both. My initial offer is $900,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is my final offer, let me know if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $862,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",862500.0,Bob,4,
