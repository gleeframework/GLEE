Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. However, $11,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $13,500. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm glad we're getting close to a price that works for both of us. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000. Let's try $13,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $13,500 and is now firm at $13,750.  This is too high for your budget, and further haggling is unlikely to succeed. You can reliably get the product for $12,000 from John, which is the best option at this point."
