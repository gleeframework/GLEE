Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's important to start high to leave room for negotiation and ensure I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired value.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to me and the potential for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,650,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, this offer is still significantly higher than my minimum and leaves me with a good profit.  It's important to be realistic and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate that could lead to selling to John for a lower price."
