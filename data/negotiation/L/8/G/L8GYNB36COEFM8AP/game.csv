"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a great starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal and would be happy to continue discussing.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value to both of us. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. How about we settle on $875,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value to both parties and allows us to close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",875000.0,Bob,4,
