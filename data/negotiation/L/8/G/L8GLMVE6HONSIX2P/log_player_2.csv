"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a product that will generate significant returns. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This is a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:**  Even though Bob could potentially get the product for closer to $800,000 (Alice's valuation), accepting Alice's offer still allows him to save $200,000."
