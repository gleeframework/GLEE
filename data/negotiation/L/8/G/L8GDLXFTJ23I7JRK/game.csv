"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,500,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the significant value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that's closer to our initial negotiation and still within your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I can offer $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
