Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum price, I can still push for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $125? It's a fair compromise that we could both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $115? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $115 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum and I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by continuing to negotiate."
