{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.  I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum price of $100, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit higher. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $125.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $122.50 is very close to my counteroffer of $125. I'm happy to accept this offer as it's still above my minimum price of $100 and  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price."
