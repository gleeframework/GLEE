Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 185}

I'm countering with $185. This is still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum, I'm concerned that if I reject it, Bob might become less interested. I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $160 is a decent price and I'm willing to take it at this point."
