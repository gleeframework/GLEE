"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12500, which is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
