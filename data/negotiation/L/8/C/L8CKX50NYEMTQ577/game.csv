"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll sell the product to you for $8500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your revised offer, and I think this is a fair price. What do you think?",7200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're still looking to save some money, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7200. I'll sell the product to you for $8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
