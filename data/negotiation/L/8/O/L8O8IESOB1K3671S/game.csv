"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm sure you'll find it's worth the extra investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
