This price reflects the significant value I know this product will bring to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than what John is asking. 
* **The price is within Bob's budget:**  Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is well below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision for Bob."
