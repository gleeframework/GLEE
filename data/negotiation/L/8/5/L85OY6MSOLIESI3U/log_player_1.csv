Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, it's a fantastic product for you!"", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

It's time to cut my losses. Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and we're running out of time. I'll take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
