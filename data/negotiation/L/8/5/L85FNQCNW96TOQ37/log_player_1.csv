Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another opportunity lined up for the same product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
