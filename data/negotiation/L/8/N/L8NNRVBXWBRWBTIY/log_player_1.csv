Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking to get $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's valuation but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly approach:** Using a friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a feel for his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still not enough.
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my target by making a counteroffer and continuing negotiations.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have the option to sell to John for $120, which gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Closing the gap:** This counteroffer brings me closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By offering a price slightly above Bob's offer, I'm still signaling that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $85 would be a fair price given my budget. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob has shown some flexibility, his offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more concessions and further lower the price. There's no guarantee that he'll budge on his offer.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $120. This is a safer and more profitable option compared to the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
