Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
