Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $11,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try and counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you place on this product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $12,000 is a good price considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of selling to John for $10,000."
