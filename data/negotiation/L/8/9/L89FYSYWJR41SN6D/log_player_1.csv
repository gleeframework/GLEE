Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get a price closer to that from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering the product at $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, there's a subtle implication that this is Bob's chance to buy before someone else does.

It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer, given his valuation of $80. However, it maximizes your potential profit before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
