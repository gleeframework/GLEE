"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
