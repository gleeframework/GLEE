"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $120. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm counteroffering at $110. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is still too high for me.  My absolute limit is $100.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy.  Otherwise, I might have to consider my other options.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $105. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",105.0,Alice,7,
