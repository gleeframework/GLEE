"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. This is a great deal considering its true value.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial price and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite a ways off.  $16,000 is more than I'm looking to spend. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $12,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I appreciate your effort to compromise.  However, $13,250 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,750. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",13750.0,Alice,7,
