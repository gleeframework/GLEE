This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to $110, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5.

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while he's shown interest, he's not willing to meet my minimum price. It's clear that we're not going to come to an agreement. I'm better off selling to John for $120. It's guaranteed, and it's above my minimum value."
