Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. This might incentivize him to accept.
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum while still keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
