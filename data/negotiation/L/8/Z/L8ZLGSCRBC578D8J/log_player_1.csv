"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80, but there's still room to get a better price. I believe I can secure a higher price by counter-offering. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to negotiate. This helps me maintain leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to take a slight risk in hoping to secure a higher price from Bob.  The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Strategically:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that is closer to my initial offer than Bob's, signaling that I'm willing to compromise but not give in entirely. 
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and creating a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiation moving forward by offering a specific price and presenting it as a way to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $98? That's a fair bit closer to your price while still working for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $98 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's a good deal for me, as it provides a substantial profit.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure this offer and move on.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially try to negotiate a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee of success. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $80."
