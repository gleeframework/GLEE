"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be useful to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about we bring the price down to $10,000? I think that's a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and while there's room for negotiation, accepting $10,000 would be a substantial loss. I'd rather see if we can reach a more agreeable price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is considerably below its true value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm seeing some movement here, which is good. To make this happen, let's meet halfway at $15,500. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
