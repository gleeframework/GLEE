"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be useful to me, but I have a budget in mind. How about we bring the price down to $10,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is considerably below its true value. To make this work, I can come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm seeing some movement here, which is good. To make this happen, let's meet halfway at $15,500. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
