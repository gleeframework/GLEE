Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I want to start with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering $110 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially still reach a price above my minimum ($80).
* **Maintain attractiveness:**  The offer is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it enticing for him to consider. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but wants to see if he can secure a better deal. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I aim to meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $100 is a significant profit margin and well above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Testing Bob's flexibility:**  This counteroffer gauges how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and if he's willing to move closer to my initial asking price."
