# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still not willing to go above $850,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price either. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close to my counteroffer:** Alice's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 higher than my counteroffer of $850,000.
* **Significant savings:** Accepting this offer means saving $375,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. There's a chance Alice might walk away or I might end up paying more.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice, as it provides a significant savings with minimal risk."
