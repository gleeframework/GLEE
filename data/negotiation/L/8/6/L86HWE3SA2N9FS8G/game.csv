"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1200000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. This amount aligns more closely with what I am willing to spend. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I believe the product's value warrants a price closer to $1150000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I respect your valuation of the product. While I would like to meet you halfway, I am still constrained by my budget. I am willing to offer $1125000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more aligned with your expectations.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1125000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a slight adjustment to reach a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1200000. This is my final concession, and I hope you'll consider it a fair offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
