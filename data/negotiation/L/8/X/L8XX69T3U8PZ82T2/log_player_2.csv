"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiations.  However, $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still aiming to save more.  There's room to negotiate further, especially since Alice is willing to counter.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and try $10,750.  This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair deal. Let's settle this at $10,900.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's value while still providing you with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily lowering the price, and Alice has met him halfway. At this point, $10,900 is a good deal for Bob, considering his goal was to pay less than $12,000.  He's saving $1,100 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile purchase.  Furthermore, rejecting the offer means risking Alice walking away and potentially facing a higher price from John."
