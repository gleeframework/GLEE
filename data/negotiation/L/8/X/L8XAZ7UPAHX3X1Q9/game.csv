"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,250?  That way we both get a good deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still too far from what I need.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,5,
