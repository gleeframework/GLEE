"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while still maximizing my profit. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is too low, especially given that John is willing to pay $12,000. It's still early in the negotiation, and I have room to maneuver. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,250?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 
I'm counteroffering at $9,250, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above Bob's perceived value and closer to my ideal price. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's still too far below my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John. I will counteroffer again, aiming to bring Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,750 is still too far from what I need.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above Bob's perceived value. I'm also emphasizing that this is a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage a deal."
