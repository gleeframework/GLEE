"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to pay something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and the return on investment you'll see. Let's find a compromise â€“ how about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this price point accurately reflects the significant advantages it will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, but I can't go any higher than that. I need to ensure this purchase makes financial sense for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us. I understand this is a significant investment for you.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber and will give you a strong advantage in the market.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
