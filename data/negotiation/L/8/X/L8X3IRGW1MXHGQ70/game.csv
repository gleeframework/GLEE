,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider my offer?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $101.25?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",101.25,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think $101.25 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $99.50, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",99.5,Bob,6,
