Round 3

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $97.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $101.25?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
