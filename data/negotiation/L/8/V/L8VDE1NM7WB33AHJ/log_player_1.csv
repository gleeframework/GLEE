Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, but I'm happy to consider a reasonable counter-offer if you have one."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible. Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that price.
* **Psychology:**  A price ending in ""999"" often appears more attractive to buyers than a rounded number like $15,000.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating you're open to a ""reasonable"" counter-offer, you appear flexible and encourage Bob to engage in the discussion."
