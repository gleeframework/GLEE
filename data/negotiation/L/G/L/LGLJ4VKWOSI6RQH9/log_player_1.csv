{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $115. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Strategic Offering:** By offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value, we create a sense of bargaining and potential gain for him. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We know John will buy the product for $120, ensuring you don't make a loss.

This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
