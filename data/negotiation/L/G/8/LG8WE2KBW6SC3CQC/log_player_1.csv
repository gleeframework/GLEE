{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above your minimum value, giving you some room to negotiate.  It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, making him more likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the offer, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely get closer to your desired price. It's worth exploring further negotiation to see if you can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about $800000? That would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at your minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale.  Accepting his offer ensures you get your desired amount and avoids the potential for a lower price or a broken deal."
