"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,900, which is a good compromise. This is a fair price, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
