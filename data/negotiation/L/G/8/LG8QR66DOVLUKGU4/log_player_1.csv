Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,900, which is a good compromise. This is a fair price, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
