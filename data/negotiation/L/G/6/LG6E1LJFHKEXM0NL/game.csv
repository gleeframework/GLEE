"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,600,000. It's a unique asset with the potential to revolutionize your operations. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000, but that's my absolute floor. This is a rare opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However, $2,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,800,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've outlined.  Let's meet in the middle.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
