"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and it's still above my minimum price.  Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and lets us get this deal done.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $127.50. That's the highest I'm willing to pay.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $127.50 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's try $129.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but that's my final offer.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really need to make a decision on this product.",128.0,Bob,6,
