"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140. Would you be interested in buying it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still below John's offer, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price for you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to accept his offer than to risk getting a lower price or having to sell to John at my minimum."
