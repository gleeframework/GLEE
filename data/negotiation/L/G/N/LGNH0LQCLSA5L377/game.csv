"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,350,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget limit. ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I can meet you at $1,300,000. That's the absolute lowest I can go.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
