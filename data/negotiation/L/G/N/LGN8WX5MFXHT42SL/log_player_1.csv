Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **Profit:** Offering the product for $100 gives me a $20 profit, which is a good return considering my minimum acceptable price is $80. 
* **Likelihood of Acceptance:** $100 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $120 to him. There's a high chance he'll accept.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $80, guaranteeing I won't lose money."
