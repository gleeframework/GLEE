"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $950000 for the product, but I can't go higher than that.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
