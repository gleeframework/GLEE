Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,500 if Bob accepts your offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $14,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving you room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price slightly too high. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good deal with Bob and ensuring you don't miss out on a profitable sale to John."
