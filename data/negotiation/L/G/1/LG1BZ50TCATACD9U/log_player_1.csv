"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Building a relationship:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, aiming to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Openness to compromise:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Setting the stage for counteroffers:** By stating that I'm open to finding a price that works for both, I'm setting the stage for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is a compromise, dropping from my initial $1,200,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Maintain Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and frames the price as a fair compromise.
* **Openness to Compromise:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further, but with a clear expectation of a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, so I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes of reaching a higher price. I'm willing to risk another round, as John's offer is a secure fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** My counteroffer is at my absolute minimum price, making it clear that I won't go lower.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the unique value of the product, emphasizing its worth. 
* **Finality:** The message implies that this is a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the mutual benefit of a successful deal to further incentivize Bob to accept."
