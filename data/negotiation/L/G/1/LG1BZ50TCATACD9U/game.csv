"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $850000 is a good starting point, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. I believe this represents a fair compromise, allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
