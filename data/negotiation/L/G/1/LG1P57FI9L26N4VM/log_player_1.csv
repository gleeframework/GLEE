Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150 guaranteed, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $150. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but the message frames it as a ""great deal,"" potentially enticing him to consider it further.

By starting high, I maintain the potential for maximum profit while still leaving the door open for Bob to engage in a negotiation."
