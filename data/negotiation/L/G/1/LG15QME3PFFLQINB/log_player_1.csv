"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to stay within it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $13,500. This offer reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $13,500 is a bit too high. I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly not willing to meet the lowest price acceptable to me ($12,000).  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him, and I risk leaving money on the table if I keep going. Accepting John's offer guarantees I get my minimum desired price."
