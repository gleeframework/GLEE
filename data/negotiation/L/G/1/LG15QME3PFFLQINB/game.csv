"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $13,500. This offer reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a reasonable price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $13,500 is a bit too high. I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
