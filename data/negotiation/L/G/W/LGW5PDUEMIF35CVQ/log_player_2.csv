"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in a negotiation. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying under your maximum budget. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. If she immediately rejects it, you know you have a long way to go. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $800,000.  This gives you leverage in the negotiation, as you don't *need* to buy from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial offer reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This is my best offer and represents a significant discount from my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, she's still very far from a price you'd find acceptable. It's important to show her you're serious about a lower price point. You'll need to counteroffer again, but be prepared to walk away if she doesn't move significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price, but $1,800,000 is still far beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I need to see some real movement on price for this to work for me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Increasing to $700,000 shows you're willing to negotiate, but the smaller increment signals that Alice needs to make more significant concessions.
* **Firm Limit:**  Stating your ""absolute limit"" adds weight to your offer and sets a clear boundary. While it might not be completely true, it can be an effective negotiation tactic.
* **Pressure:**  By emphasizing the need for ""real movement,"" you are subtly letting Alice know that you have other options and are prepared to walk away from the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I also have other interested buyers.  To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,500,000. I'm willing to honor our negotiations and drop my price to $1,600,000, but this is my absolute floor. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is trying to pressure you with the ""other buyer"" and ""final offer"" tactics. It's important not to fold under pressure, especially when the price is still significantly higher than your target.
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:**  You have the advantage of knowing John's offer. Don't reveal your backup plan just yet.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While her offer has come down, there's still a significant gap between $1,600,000 and your budget. It's worth seeing if she'll move further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your honesty about other buyers, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  To be completely upfront, my absolute maximum is $800,000. If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  It's time to lay your cards on the table. By revealing your true maximum, you demonstrate seriousness and set a clear, non-negotiable limit. 
* **Walk-Away Ready:** You're signaling that you're prepared to walk away from the deal if Alice doesn't budge. This is a powerful negotiating tool, especially if she believes she might lose the sale altogether.
* **Gauge Her Response:** This counteroffer will reveal how willing Alice is to make a deal. If she rejects it outright, you know it's time to go with John. If she counters, there might be a deal to be made."
