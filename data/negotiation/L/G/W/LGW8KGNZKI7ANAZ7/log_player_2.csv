"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the initial price. The goal is to save money, and we know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows us to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price of $12,000. This shows Alice that we are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if we can't reach a fair price. It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her initial price, it's still above our goal of saving as much money as possible. We can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  There are still 7 rounds left, so we have time to explore options and see if we can get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility. This also acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a considerable saving compared to her initial price and John's offer.  The goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties while ensuring a good deal for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $11,200 is a good deal.  We are still able to save $800 compared to John's offer and are getting closer to our goal of saving as much money as possible.  We have 5 rounds left, but with each round there is a chance of Alice becoming less flexible, so it's wise to take this offer and secure the product."
