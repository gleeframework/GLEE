"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm intrigued by the product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600000.  This reflects my initial assessment of the product's value, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Considering the value I've assessed for this product, I'm prepared to offer $650000. This is a fair price that reflects a compromise from both sides.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $650000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I'm getting closer to your price point,  $675000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $650000.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,6,
