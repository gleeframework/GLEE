"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the unique item you're getting.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
