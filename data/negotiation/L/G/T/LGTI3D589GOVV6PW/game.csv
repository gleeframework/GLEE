"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
