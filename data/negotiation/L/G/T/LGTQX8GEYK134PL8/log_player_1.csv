Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit margin.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still keeps the price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Strong But Not Greedy:** This price point signals that I value the product highly but am also open to making a deal with Bob."
