"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's find a solution.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I can do $13,500, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. This is my final offer in this range.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,500, which is $13,000. This is my final offer in this range.",13000.0,Alice,7,
