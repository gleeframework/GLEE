Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate our negotiation so far, but to be honest, your current offer is simply too low. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal: $1,100,000. However, I need you to understand that if this offer isn't acceptable, I have another buyer ready at my minimum price. This is your opportunity to acquire something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Alice is trying to pressure you with the ""other buyer"" tactic. However, you still have John as a backup and a few rounds to negotiate. It's worth seeing if you can push Alice a bit further down."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're very close.  I can see you're serious, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000.  This is my final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber, and I need a decision now.  Otherwise, I'm moving forward with my other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","This is a tough one! Alice is really turning up the pressure. However, she's also showing signs of cracking. Let's analyze:

* **""Final offer"" bluff:**  Experienced negotiators know to be wary of ""final offer"" claims. It's often a tactic to force a decision.
* **Price movement:** Alice came down to $975,000, which is a significant jump from her $1,100,000. This indicates she's willing to negotiate further. 

Considering this, it's worth one more (and truly final) counteroffer.

**However**, if you're uncomfortable with any more risk, buying from John at $1,000,000 is perfectly valid. It's better to secure the product than risk losing it and potentially paying even more elsewhere.

**If you're feeling bold, here's the recommended action:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**For Round 8, offer $925,000.** Be firm but polite. This leaves you some wiggle room if Alice counters again, and there's still John as a safety net."
