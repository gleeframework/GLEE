"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. My starting price is $1,000,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I can try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the potential value this product holds for you.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $800000? This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and get the best possible price without further negotiations.  While I could potentially try to push for a higher price in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with selling to John for the same amount."
