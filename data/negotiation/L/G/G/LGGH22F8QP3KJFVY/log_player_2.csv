"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. My starting price is $1000000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but $1,000,000 is still a significant amount. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, considering the potential value this product holds for you.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is better than her original offer, but $900,000 is still a significant amount of money.  It's still worth exploring if a lower price is possible. It's also worth noting that there are 7 rounds remaining, so there's ample time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show a willingness to negotiate while pushing for a lower price.  The offer is still significantly less than Alice's initial offer but is more than my previous counteroffer. This creates a sense of progress in the negotiation and shows that I'm actively trying to find a common ground."
