"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. My starting price is $1000000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $750000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900000, considering the potential value this product holds for you.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $800000? This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
