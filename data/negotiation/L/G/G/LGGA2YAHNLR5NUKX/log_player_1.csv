{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer aims to get a higher price than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe $1,750,000 is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to Bob. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest level based on his counteroffer and proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about we consider $1,600,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,700,000.  Let's compromise and settle on $1,650,000. This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to go above $1,550,000 for this product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is just below my minimum, but considering the possibility of continued negotiation potentially leading to even lower offers, I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $1,550,000."
