"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.**  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **You have 10 rounds:** You can use these to try and negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You know you can get the product for $10,000 if needed, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product but would be more comfortable at $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  A $2,000 discount is significant but not unreasonable. 
* **Sets the Stage:** Establishes your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** You can adjust your offer higher if needed in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $8000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good starting point for continued negotiation:** While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still above your target.
* **You have time and leverage:** You can continue negotiating, knowing that John's offer is available if you fail.
* **Room for more compromise:** There's still potential for Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. Would you be willing to come down a little closer to my initial offer of $8,000? Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  You're increasing your offer slightly, showing willingness to meet halfway but still maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** You're emphasizing finding a price that works for both of you, making it seem like a collaborative solution.
* **Maintain Leverage:** You're not settling for $9,000 yet, keeping John's offer as a backup."
