"I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $13,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, so I'll offer $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12500.0,Bob,4,
