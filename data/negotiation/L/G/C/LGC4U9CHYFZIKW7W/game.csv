"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
