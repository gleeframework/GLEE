You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than the product's worth to me ($1,200,000).  I want to try and get a better price, so I will reject her offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still within my budget and is a better price than John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's also closer to my desired price.  It's a good deal for me and allows Alice to make a reasonable profit, so I'll accept her offer."
