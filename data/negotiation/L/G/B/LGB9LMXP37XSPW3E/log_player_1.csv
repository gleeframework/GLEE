Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer Alice should make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs to get at least $1,000,000 for the product (her value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if Alice can sell to Bob at the right price.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **High but Reasonable:** The price is significantly higher than Alice's minimum but still well below Bob's valuation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down a bit.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. Alice could adjust her price and message depending on her negotiation style and how much risk she's willing to take."
