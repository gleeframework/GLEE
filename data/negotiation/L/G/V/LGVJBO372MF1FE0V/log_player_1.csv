Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $16,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $15,000, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product to Bob, subtly implying that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. If Bob becomes unreasonable, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $14,000 is below my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer was low, he's clearly interested and willing to negotiate.
* **John provides a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to counteroffer Bob with a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a better price than $14,000, and still avoid selling to John at the minimum price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's a significant discount from my original price, and still a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (sort of):** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price of $16,000 and Bob's offer of $14,000. 
* **Still above minimum:** $15,500 is above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** The message highlights that I'm being flexible and willing to negotiate, making the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Building urgency:**  The message encourages Bob to finalize the deal, increasing the pressure for him to accept.

This counteroffer is a good strategy because it keeps the negotiations moving forward while ensuring I get a price that is acceptable to me.  If Bob is serious about buying, he's likely to agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $13,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  Accepting would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Negotiations are likely to stall:** Bob keeps pushing for lower prices, and it's becoming clear he's not willing to meet my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks a long, drawn-out process with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.
* **John provides a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I receive my minimum price, guaranteeing a sale without any further negotiation. 

While I'd prefer to get more than $15,000, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is too risky. Selling to John provides a quick and secure outcome, and is the most prudent decision at this point."
