"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take it, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. I believe $1,100,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to get Bob to finally accept."
