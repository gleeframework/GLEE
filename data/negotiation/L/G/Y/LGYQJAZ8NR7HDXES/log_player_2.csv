{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. There are 10 rounds, giving you plenty of opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by showing Alice you're serious about buying the product, but you're also willing to push for a lower price.  $1,050,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer and is within your budget. It's a good starting point for a potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,100,000 is still too high.  You have several rounds left to negotiate. Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice and allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your previous offer by $25,000, showing Alice that you are willing to meet her halfway.  It's a reasonable compromise, as it's still significantly lower than her last offer but not so low that it would likely be rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to your ideal price.  It's only $40,000 above your ideal price point and you have several rounds left to negotiate further if needed.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, so accepting her offer at this point is a good strategy to secure the deal while saving a substantial amount of money."
