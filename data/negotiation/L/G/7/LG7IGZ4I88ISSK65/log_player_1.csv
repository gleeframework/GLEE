Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, and Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, still landing you well above your minimum price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""fair deal"" and ""value"" helps make the offer more palatable to Bob. 

By starting the negotiation at $1,150,000, you give yourself the best chance to secure a significantly higher profit than your backup offer from John."
