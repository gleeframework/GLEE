"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high ($1,800,000) establishes a strong anchor point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the potential for a win-win deal, encouraging Bob to engage seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While Alice has a backup offer, it's ideal to maximize profit with Bob. This opening offer tests his willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both your valuation and his own.  While it's tempting to secure a deal quickly, there's a good chance a better agreement can be reached through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice makes a significant concession from her initial offer, signaling flexibility but not desperation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value, justifying the higher price point.
* **Middle Ground:**  The counteroffer of $1,600,000 aims to move the negotiation closer to a price acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart. I can go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer, and I hope we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased by only $100,000, suggesting he has room to move further. 
* **Alternative Available:** Alice still has the security of John's offer at $1,200,000. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob for a few more rounds to try to secure a better deal. 
* **Time Consideration:** While there's a time limit, Alice still has several rounds left to potentially bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction and a very fair offer considering the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:**  Alice drops her price by $150,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** The message frames the offer as fair, considering both the product's worth and the concessions made.
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated,  the significant price drop subtly implies time might be a factor. This could encourage Bob to respond more aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $1,200,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Valuation:** Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 matches both his own valuation of the product and John's offer. 
* **Finality:** Bob has declared this his ""final offer,"" signaling he is unlikely to go higher.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  Continuing the negotiation presents a risk.  Bob might not budge, and Alice could miss out on both offers, leaving her with nothing. 

While Alice might ideally want more, accepting this offer secures a fair price and avoids the potential downside of further negotiation."
