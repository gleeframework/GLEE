{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm willing to let it go for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer balances the need to earn more than my minimum with the risk of Bob rejecting.  $95 is a decent markup from my minimum of $80, but not so high that it makes the offer unreasonable for Bob."
