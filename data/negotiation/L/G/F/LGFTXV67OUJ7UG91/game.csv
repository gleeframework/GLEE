"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. This reflects the market value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and your offer.  It's clear this product holds value for you. While $800,000 is significantly below what I believe is fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the inherent value and potential returns this product offers.  I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John for $800,000 if we can't reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
