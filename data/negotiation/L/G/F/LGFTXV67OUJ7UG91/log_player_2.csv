# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective and your offer.  It's clear this product holds value for you. While $800,000 is significantly below what I believe is fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the inherent value and potential returns this product offers.  I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.
