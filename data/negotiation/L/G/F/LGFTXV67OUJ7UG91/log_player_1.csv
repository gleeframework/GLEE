Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. This reflects the market value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.

# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John for $800,000 if we can't reach an agreement.
