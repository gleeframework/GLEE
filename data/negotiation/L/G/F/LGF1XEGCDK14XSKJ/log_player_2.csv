"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I get a fair deal for my work. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation here. By rejecting her initial offer, you might encourage her to come down to a price closer to her $8,000 valuation."
