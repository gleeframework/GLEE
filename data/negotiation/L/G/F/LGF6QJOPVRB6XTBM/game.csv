"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can work together to find a price that suits both our interests.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, considering the product's value to me, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this moment. I understand the value of the product to you, but it's also crucial for me to secure a price that fits my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. This would allow us to both walk away from this transaction satisfied.

"Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not sure I'm ready to accept it just yet. I've done my research and I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",950000.0,Alice,5,
