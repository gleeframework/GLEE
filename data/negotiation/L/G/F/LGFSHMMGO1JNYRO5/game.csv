"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
