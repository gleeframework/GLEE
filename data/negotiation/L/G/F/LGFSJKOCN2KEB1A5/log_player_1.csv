Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the point where I'd rather buy from John, but I still like the product. How about $125? That's as high as I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'd like to get.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150, I'm going to take that option and avoid further negotiation."
