"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $11,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since the product is worth $10,000 to you, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand you're looking to save a bit of money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,750. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

You're still within your budget, but Alice's offer is closer to her ideal price than yours. You can likely get a better deal with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $10,625. That's a fair price for both of us, and I can move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10625}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $10,700. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, but she is still higher than you are comfortable paying. You have the option to keep negotiating, but you've already made a few counteroffers and it's possible that Alice won't budge further.  Since John is offering the product for $10,000, which is your ideal price, it makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
