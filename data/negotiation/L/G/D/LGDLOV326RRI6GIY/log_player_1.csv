"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  This initial offer allows for some potential back and forth without immediately pushing Bob away.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and also below my initial offer. 
* **More negotiation is needed.** I'm confident I can get a better price through further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, but I'm not willing to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise.
* **Middle Ground:** $13,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling my desire to find common ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to further justify my price.
* **Call to Action:** I'm encouraging Bob to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $11,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I want to maximize my potential earnings. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through.
* **Potential for further compromise:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** I'm using language like ""Let's make this deal happen"" to subtly create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $12,500 is still above Bob's perceived value but close enough to his last offer that it could be appealing."
