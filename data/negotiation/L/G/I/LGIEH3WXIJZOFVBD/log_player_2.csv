"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $10,000. I think you'll really love it and it's a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer ($10,000) is higher than your walk-away price ($12,000) and significantly higher than her perceived value ($8,000).**  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. 
* **You have a backup option (John).** This gives you leverage in the negotiation. 
 
Let's see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
