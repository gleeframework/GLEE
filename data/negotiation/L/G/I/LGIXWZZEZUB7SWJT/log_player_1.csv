Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. It also establishes a positive tone and emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $13,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little lower than I'd like. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a little too low for me, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell to John to avoid further negotiation.  While $15,000 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to what I want and will avoid any more back-and-forth with Bob."
