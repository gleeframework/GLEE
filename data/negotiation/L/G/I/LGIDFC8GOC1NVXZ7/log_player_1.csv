{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to Bob's counteroffer to encourage a smooth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't exceed $85 for it. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to ensure I get at least my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm offering $95 as a counteroffer, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also protects my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it, but I still can't go beyond $87 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Given the back-and-forth, it seems unlikely we'll reach an agreement.  To ensure I make at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $100."
