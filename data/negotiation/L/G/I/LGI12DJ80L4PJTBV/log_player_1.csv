Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing my minimum price. The phrase ""before I list it publicly"" might incentivize Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive, not demanding, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If I knew Bob was particularly price-sensitive or a tough negotiator, I might adjust my starting price slightly lower. 
* **Market Demand:** While I have John as a backup, knowing the general market demand for the product could influence my pricing strategy."
