This seems like a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Price:** You're getting a $120,000 discount from Alice's original price and a $40,000 discount from her 'final offer'.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but there's also the risk Alice walks away, and you end up paying John the full $1,200,000. 
* **""Final Offer"" Language:** Alice used the phrase ""final offer."" While this might be a negotiation tactic, it suggests she's unlikely to move much further."
