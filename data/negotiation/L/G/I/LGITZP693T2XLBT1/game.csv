"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd be comfortable with?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a good balance between our positions.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
