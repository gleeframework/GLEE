``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I know I won't sell for less than $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves $200,000 for potential negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $950,000 is a reasonable price that is likely to be attractive to Bob, given his valuation. 

By offering this price, I have a good chance of securing a sale with Bob while still getting a significant amount of profit."
