"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,300,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential return on investment. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value you'll gain from it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  To be frank, I have a firm budget in mind.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  However, the value of this product is truly unique and goes beyond typical market comparisons. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it recognizes the value you'll gain while still reflecting the worth of what I'm offering.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I respect your position on the product's value.  However, I need to stick to my budget.  I can go up to $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",750000.0,Bob,6,
