"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $11,000 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to its true value. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This gives you a good price and me a fair return. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a reasonable compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $12,500 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you working with me on this. How about $13,000? That's a strong offer, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting close to my minimum, we're running out of time and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower offer. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a better deal."
