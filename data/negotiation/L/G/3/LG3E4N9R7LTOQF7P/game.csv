"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay  $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $1,550,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
