{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay  $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'll counter with a higher price, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if the negotiations don't move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, hoping to incentivize Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Would you consider $1,550,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
