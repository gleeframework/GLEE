"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you consider $75?  ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $82.  Would you be willing to come down to $78? This is really my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $78 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $81. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",81.0,Alice,5,
