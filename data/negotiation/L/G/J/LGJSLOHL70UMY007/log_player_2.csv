"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $135 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an excellent opportunity to experience its benefits at a reasonable cost compared to its market value of $150. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $150, and John will sell it to you at that price. There's a chance you can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down."
