"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $17,000.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it'll be just as valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, it's not unreasonable. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $13,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,750. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to maximize my profit, so I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm hoping to get a bit more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $14,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $15,250? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose $14,500 as a compromise. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price, I'm concerned that we're reaching a stalemate with Bob.  He's not budging much, and I've already had to compromise several times.  To avoid further risk of getting stuck in a cycle of rejected offers and counteroffers, I'll sell to John for $15,000 to guarantee a safe and profitable deal."
