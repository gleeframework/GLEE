This is an opportunity to acquire a product that is not only valuable but also tailored to meet your specific needs. I look forward to hearing your response and potentially discussing how this product can contribute to your success. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum budget is $12,000.  While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob can get the product from John for his maximum budget, so rejecting Alice's offer makes more financial sense."
