"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than $1,200,000, you can likely negotiate a lower price.  There's a significant difference between Alice's value ($800,000) and your maximum value ($1,200,000), leaving room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a price that's halfway between Alice's value and your maximum. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiations, showing your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price, it's still higher than what you'd ideally pay. There's still room to negotiate a better price, and the potential savings justify rejecting her offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice has moved closer to your price, you can also move closer to hers. Offering $900,000 shows your willingness to compromise, and it's likely that Alice will accept this offer, given that she's closer to her minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair compromise for both parties and allows you to buy the product for a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now very close to your maximum price, and there's no guarantee that you can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. You've already rejected multiple offers and have reached a point where the potential savings are not significant enough to justify the risk of further negotiation. It's better to go ahead and buy the product from John at $1,200,000, even though it's not your ideal price, to ensure you acquire the product without further delays."
