(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's a significant drop from her original price, but still leaves room for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

``` 

Alice has come down a bit, and $850,000 is a good price.  It's within my budget and a decent savings compared to buying from John."
