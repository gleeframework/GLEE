Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind the $1,500,000 floor from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is acceptable and matches John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll use this round to try and gauge Bob's true willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am confident in the value of the product. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is mutually acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price. It's important to secure a deal, and this offer provides a good outcome."
