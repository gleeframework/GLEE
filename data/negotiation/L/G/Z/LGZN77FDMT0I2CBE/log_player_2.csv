"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You have a better alternative with John, who's offering the product for your desired price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice, but you'll always have the option to switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $120 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. This would allow me to purchase it while still staying within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider a price of $105 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but it's still above your budget. You are still better off buying from John for $100. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as you might be able to get a better price, but you always have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If this works for you, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I am willing to offer the product for $100. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this meets your requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached your target price of $100.  While you could continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price, you have already reached your maximum budget and there is no guarantee that you will get a better offer.  At this point, it is wiser to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
