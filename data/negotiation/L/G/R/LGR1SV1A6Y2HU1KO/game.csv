"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but $600,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we try to find a middle ground between our two offers?  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
