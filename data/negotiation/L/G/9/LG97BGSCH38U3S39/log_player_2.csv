"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a lower price. $13,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $14,500, but still above Alice's minimum of $12,000, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still less than what Bob would pay from John ($15,000).  While Bob could try for a lower price again, it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept, and the risk of losing the deal entirely exists. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with."
