{""product_price"": $1,500,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. I'll think carefully about my next move.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} and send a counteroffer to Bob. I'll try to get closer to my initial offer, but not too close to Bob's offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $1,300,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} and sell the product to John for $1,200,000. I've already reached my minimum acceptable price, and it's better to sell to John than to continue negotiating with Bob."
