"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet your price. I would like to propose $1,000,000 as the final offer for your product. I believe this price reflects its value and I am confident it is a fair offer. I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
