Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant gain. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to negotiate further or accept John's offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable potentially losing Bob as a buyer if he finds the initial price too high.
* If you prioritize a quick and guaranteed sale, offering it closer to $10,000 might be a better approach."
