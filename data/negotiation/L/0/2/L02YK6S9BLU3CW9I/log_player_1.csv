"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This should give Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a healthy margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a lot of money, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth. I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before I consider selling to Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This keeps the negotiations moving and hopefully incentivizes Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is now in line with John's offer. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal. While I would have liked to get a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's important to recognize a good deal when I see one."
