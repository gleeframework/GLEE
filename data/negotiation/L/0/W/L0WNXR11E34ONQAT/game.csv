"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your considerations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer and appreciate your interest in the product. However, $950000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1050000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Please let me know if this is something you can work with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway.  While your offer is closer to what I'm hoping for, $1025000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to settle for. Let's try $1035000 as a final offer. This is a small adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",1035000.0,Alice,5,
