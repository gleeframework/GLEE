"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,200,000.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he starts by offering a significant discount of $300,000 from Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is now at the maximum price Bob is willing to pay. There's no point in further negotiation, as John is also offering the product for the same price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product without further risk."
