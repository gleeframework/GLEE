{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring negotiation before resorting to the guaranteed but higher price from John.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price while leaving room for negotiation. I'm assuming Alice is motivated to sell, and this price is still within my budget."

Alice's offer is closer to my preferred price, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still pushing for a lower price. This is a compromise position, hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that:

* Alice might become less willing to compromise
* I might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price within my budget."
