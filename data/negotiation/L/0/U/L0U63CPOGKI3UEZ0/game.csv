"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $11,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering I'm paying more than John's offer and it will help us close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $10,500 for the product. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can close the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $10,000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I believe the product's value justifies this price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll do $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
