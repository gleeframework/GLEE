"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750. Can we discuss further?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your coming up to $9,750.  While that's getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,250.  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'll meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can we finalize the deal here?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your frustration, but $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be honest with you, Alice. I've been considering buying the product from John for $8,000. I really like the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,750, but if I don't see a better offer from you, I'll be forced to walk away and buy from John. Can you meet me at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,8,
