Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit of $2,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $15,000 to him, so there's potential for a higher price. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  A firm offer of $15,000 might be seen as too aggressive and could make Bob hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** You've stated that the product is worth no less than $12,000 to you. Accepting his offer would mean no profit.
* **There's still potential for negotiation:**  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired amount. 
* **Selling to John would yield the same amount:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, it makes more sense to try and get closer to your desired price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you have the opportunity to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This way we both get a fair price and can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to your desired price:** This counteroffer brings the price closer to your desired $14,000, making it a more profitable deal for you.
* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By splitting the difference, you demonstrate a willingness to work towards a deal. 
* **Avoids risking selling to John:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation with Bob open, rather than settling for the minimum with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of a price around $12500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above your minimum:**  $12,500 is more than your minimum of $12,000, meaning you would make a profit.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  Bob is already close to your desired price, and further negotiation could risk him walking away entirely.
* **Selling to John would be less profitable:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $12,000, this offer is better.

While $12,500 is not the ideal price, it's a good compromise, ensuring you make a profit while also securing a deal with Bob."
