"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120 by you. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I would like to extend this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $130. This is a great chance to experience the value it offers at a slight premium compared to its perceived worth. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can get the same product for $120 from John, so it makes no sense to pay $130 to Alice."
