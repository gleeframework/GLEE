Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $80 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still feeling like he's getting a good deal.
* **It sets a tone for negotiation:** This shows you are serious about getting a good price but also open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
