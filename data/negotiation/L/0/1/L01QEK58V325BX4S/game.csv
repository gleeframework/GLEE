"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really like it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $132?",132.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $132 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and agree on $128? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm still not comfortable with $135.  How about we split the difference again and go with $130?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",130.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $137?",137.0,Alice,7,
