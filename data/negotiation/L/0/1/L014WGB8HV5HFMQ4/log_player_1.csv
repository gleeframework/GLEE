Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this presents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to justify the high price, even if these benefits aren't explicitly stated. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""initially proposing"" and ""let me know your thoughts,"" Alice shows flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance:

* **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts the $1,300,000, Alice earns significantly more than his perceived value.
* **Secure a Sale:** If Bob negotiates down, Alice has room to maneuver while still staying above John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. This avoids the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for the guaranteed price."
