"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There are 10 rounds, so there is plenty of room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  He acknowledges the value to both parties, showing he's not just trying to lowball her. This strategy is risky, but it leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but Bob still believes he can get a better price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving him time to continue negotiating.  While $11,500 is a good price, Bob wants to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit too high at $11,500. How about we settle at $11,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to make a good sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still pushing for a lower price but is being more reasonable in his counteroffer.  He's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  $11,000 is a good compromise point, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, Bob, we're getting close. Let's make this happen - how about $11,250 and we have a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's time for Bob to secure the deal and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product from John.  At this point, $11,250 is a better deal than the $15,000 he would pay John, so accepting is the best course of action."
