"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while I value it much higher, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  My offer is $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from my true valuation, and I believe it reflects the potential benefits you'll realize from owning this product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
