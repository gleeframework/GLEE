"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This would still represent a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique capabilities and potential benefits for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
