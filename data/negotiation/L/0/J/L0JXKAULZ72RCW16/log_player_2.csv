Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $1,400,000, as Alice values the product at $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm willing to compromise, and I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This would still represent a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique capabilities and potential benefits for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,400,000 to $1,300,000. This price is still within your budget of $1,500,000 and represents a good deal, especially considering Alice's valuation of $1,000,000.  Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product and avoid further negotiation."
