"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. This allows room for negotiation and potential profit.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a higher price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer.  I believe this will make the offer more appealing to Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good compromise and I'm confident I can make a decent profit."
