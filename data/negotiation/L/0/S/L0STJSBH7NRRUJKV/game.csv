"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10000 for it.  It's a great deal for something of this quality.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $9250. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $8750 is getting more tempting, but I still need a bit more. How about $9000?  That's a fair compromise, and gets us both closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8900?  That's a small compromise on my end, and gets us very close to a deal. ",8900.0,Alice,7,
