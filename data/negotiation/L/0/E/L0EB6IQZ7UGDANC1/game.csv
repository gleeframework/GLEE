"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm sticking with $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $925,000 is simply not enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $937,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this happen.",937500.0,Alice,5,
