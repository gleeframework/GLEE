"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you're providing, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $10000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000? I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $14000? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my limit. Could we possibly agree on $13000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $14500? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued effort in finding a solution that works for both of us. I appreciate your latest offer, but unfortunately, I am still unable to move beyond my budget of $13000. I'm hoping for a slight adjustment to $13500. I believe this would allow us to close the gap while still staying within my financial limits. I look forward to your response and hope we can find a way to make this work.",13500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $14800? I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14800.0,Alice,7,
