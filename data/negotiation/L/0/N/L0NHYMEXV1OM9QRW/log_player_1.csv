"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll gauge his interest with this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.  I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's still a good deal for me, and it's getting close to what John is offering. I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John for the minimum."
