Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Product Price:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while leaving room for Bob to ask questions or negotiate.  

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a higher price increases the potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By starting at a price higher than my minimum, I can potentially come down slightly if Bob counters.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Highlighting the product's worth can incentivize Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point. The optimal strategy depends on the perceived value of the product to Bob and your risk tolerance.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000."
