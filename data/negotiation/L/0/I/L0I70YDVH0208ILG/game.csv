"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $97.50 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $90 even?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. How about we meet at $95? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
