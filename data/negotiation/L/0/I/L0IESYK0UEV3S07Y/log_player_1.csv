Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at Bob's perceived value ($800,000) is unlikely to be accepted, as you'd lose potential profit.  Offering it at your minimum ($1,200,000) gives Bob no incentive to buy. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant markup from Bob's valuation but still potentially attractive compared to losing the deal.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of you, ideally closer to $1,200,000."
