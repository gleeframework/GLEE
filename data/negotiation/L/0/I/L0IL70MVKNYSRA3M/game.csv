"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that be workable for you?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer you the product for $10,750. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
