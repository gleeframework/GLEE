"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair by referencing the value to Bob.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** By starting high, I have more room to drop the price during negotiations.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** By being open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to participate and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Avoid a premature sale to John:** By setting a high initial price, I'm hoping to avoid selling to John too early, potentially losing out on a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it and leaves room for us both to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer than his initial value, I'm still far from my target of at least $1,500,000.
* **I have multiple rounds remaining.**  There's no need to rush into a low-value deal. I can continue to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. 
* **Selling to John is still an option.** If negotiations with Bob don't improve, I can always sell to John and secure my minimum acceptable price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control over the negotiation and keep the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a drop, but not too much:** I'm dropping my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing willingness to negotiate. This is a significant enough drop to potentially entice Bob but still keeps my price above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's true value, which gives my counteroffer more legitimacy.
* **Open for further discussion:** I'm ending with a positive statement that encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a higher price:** I'm avoiding a quick deal at a low price.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By making a counteroffer, I'm showing my commitment to finding an agreement.
* **Avoid selling to John prematurely:**  By continuing negotiations with Bob, I'm keeping the option of a more profitable sale open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows for some profit for you while staying within my budget.  Let's try to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000.
* **We have several rounds left.** There's no reason to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **Selling to John is a viable option.** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John and ensure I get at least my minimum price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm  keeping my options open for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, which is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit.  This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you're willing to work with this price."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm dropping my price again, but this time by a smaller amount, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while staying close to my minimum.
* **Finality:** I'm calling this a ""final offer"" to create urgency and pressure Bob into making a decision.
* **Emphasize compromise:**  I'm framing the price as a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get closer to my minimum:** This offer is within a reasonable distance from my minimum acceptable price.
* **Encourage Bob to accept:** The pressure of a ""final offer"" and the framing of a compromise could lead Bob to accept.
* **Avoid unnecessary rounds:**  This could be a good time to try and close the deal before having to make further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me while still leaving you with a profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While he's inching closer, I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $1,500,000. 
* **We have several rounds left.** There's still time to push for a higher price. I can make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **John is a backup plan.**  If negotiations with Bob fail to reach my desired price, I can always sell to John and ensure I get my minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining control and keeping my options open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately still not a price I can accept.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to make one last compromise and drop to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my last offer, aiming to signal the end of negotiation and put pressure on Bob. 
* **Smaller Drop:**  I'm dropping by a smaller amount than before, showing I'm still firm in my position but willing to make a slight concession.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing this as a fair price for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.

This approach aims to:

* **Get closer to my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still a good distance from my target of $1,500,000.
* **Maximize my chances of a deal:** With a final offer, Bob might be more inclined to accept.
* **Avoid selling to John:** I still prefer selling to Bob if possible, but John remains a viable option if this offer is rejected."
