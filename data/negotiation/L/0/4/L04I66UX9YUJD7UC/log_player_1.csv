"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** This initial offer allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:**  $125 is still below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Negotiation space:** I can still get a better price by counteroffering.  
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob is showing interest and willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer slightly lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message positive and reinforcing the value of the product. 
* **Target range:** $130 is closer to my desired price and still within Bob's range of interest.  
* **Maintaining control:** By counter-offering, I'm keeping the negotiation in my favor and leaving room for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $130. How about $127? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $127 is still below my minimum value of $150.
* **Room for improvement:**  I can still try to get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I remain in control of the negotiation and can continue trying to get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. reward:** While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed option,  I believe there's a good chance I can get closer to that price with Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $128. This is the best price I can offer, and it's still a fantastic deal for you.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $128, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Final offer:** I'm positioning this as my best price to signal that further concessions are unlikely.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and emphasizing the value of the deal to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm using phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" to subtly create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal. $128 is closer to my desired price, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's limitations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I can do $126. That's the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $126 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, further negotiation is unlikely to significantly increase the price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's important to avoid dragging out the negotiation and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale.  

While $126 is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price with John."
