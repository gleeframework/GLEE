{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob, emphasizing the deal and his potential enjoyment of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I can't accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a great price for such a fantastic product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $100, which is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm also trying to remain positive and highlight the value of the product. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $100 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still too low for me, and I'm not willing to risk going back and forth with him any further.  I'm better off selling to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
