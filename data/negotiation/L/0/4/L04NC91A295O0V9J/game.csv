,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $80. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to look at other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $80, which is $100. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still only willing to pay $80.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go any higher.  Is there any way you can make this work for you?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer it to you for $110, which is closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",110.0,Alice,7,
