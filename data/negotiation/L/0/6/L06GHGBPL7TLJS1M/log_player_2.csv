Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable going as low as $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and $875,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's time to accept the deal and secure the product at a good price."
