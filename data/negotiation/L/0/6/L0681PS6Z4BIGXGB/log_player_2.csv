"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. This is a strong opening counter-offer and should make it clear that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but also that I won't go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'm also not too far off from John's price, which is a good safety net if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is a fair midpoint that gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down to my preferred price. John's offer is my safety net and it's the best option for me to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to give up the possibility of a lower price from Alice to guarantee I don't overspend."
