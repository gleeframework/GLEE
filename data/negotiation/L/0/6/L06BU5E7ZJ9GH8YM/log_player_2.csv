It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's room to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above what you can get from John.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get Alice closer to your target price."

Alice is getting closer to your price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
