Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport by mentioning that I believe the price is fair. This will hopefully encourage Bob to counter-offer instead of rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than my floor price.  I will counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum price of $15,000 and represents a good compromise.  While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale without risking losing the deal and needing to sell to John for a lower price."
