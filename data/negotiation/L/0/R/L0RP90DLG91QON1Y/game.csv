"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
