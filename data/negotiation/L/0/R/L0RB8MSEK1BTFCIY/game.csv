"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I think the product is worth more than $110. How about we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $115. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I think the product is still worth more than $105. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $112.50. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $110.50?",110.5,Alice,7,

I'm not going to go any higher than $108. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option. Can you meet me at $108 or I'll have to walk away?,108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to walking away, Bob, but I'm still not ready to give up. How about we meet in the middle at $109?",109.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really not willing to go any higher than $108. I think we've negotiated enough. If you're not willing to meet me at $108, I'll have to buy the product from John for $150. It's time to make a decision.",108.0,Bob,10,
