Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (even if unlikely) and feel like he's getting a slightly better deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit from Bob, it's crucial to remember that Bob might reject the offer outright. You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so don't go below that price with Bob."
