Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $925,000.  I believe this represents a fair price considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and fairness encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring a sale exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
