"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $10,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,250? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I was thinking I could offer you a slight discount if you're willing to commit to the purchase today. How about we say $11,375, and I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",11375.0,Alice,5,
