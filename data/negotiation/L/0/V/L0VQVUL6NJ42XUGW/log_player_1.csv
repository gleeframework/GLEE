Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell below $1,500,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Agreement:** For a successful deal, the price needs to be between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest possible price within the zone of agreement. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,495,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1495000}
```

**Why this Strategy Works**

* **High Anchor:**  Alice starts with a strong opening price, close to Bob's maximum. This sets a high reference point for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""significant returns"" attempts to justify the high price without revealing Alice's bottom line.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (though still very favorable to Alice).

**Important Note:** This is a one-shot negotiation. Bob has no way of knowing John's offer. If Bob is savvy, he might try a lowball counter-offer. Alice needs to decide if she's willing to go slightly lower or stick to her guaranteed sale with John."
