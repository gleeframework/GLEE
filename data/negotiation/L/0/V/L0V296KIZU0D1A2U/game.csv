"Hi Bob, I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1600000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested!",1600000.0,Alice,3,
