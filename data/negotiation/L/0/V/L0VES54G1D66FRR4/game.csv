"Alice, $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget of $8000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can do $11500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Alice,5,
