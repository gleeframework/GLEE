"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that is above Bob's valuation but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to initiate negotiations and see how receptive Bob is to the idea of purchasing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to maintain my position and push for a higher price.  I'll counter with an offer slightly above his and see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's go with $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and is within your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
