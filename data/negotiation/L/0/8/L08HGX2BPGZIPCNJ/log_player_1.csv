Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to both of us, starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning that I believe it's worth at least $10,000 to Bob subtly anchors that price in his mind.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""willing to let it go"" suggests flexibility and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know my guaranteed sale price to John. 
* It's a bold first offer, and Bob might reject it outright. However, it maximizes potential profit if successful."
