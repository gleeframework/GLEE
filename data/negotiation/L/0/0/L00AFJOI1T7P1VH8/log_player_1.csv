"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it reflects the value I place on the product.  I'm confident in the product's worth, but I'm also open to finding a fair price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's significantly less than what I know the product is worth, and even less than John's offer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,750,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's above John's offer. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and come closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to settle for a price that drastically undervalues the product. I'm going to reject his offer again and continue to explore if we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,250,000.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it's still above John's offer of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging on his price, and it's becoming clear that he's not going to come up to a price that I find acceptable.  At this point, it's more profitable to sell the product to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly more than what Bob is offering and guarantees me a sale."
