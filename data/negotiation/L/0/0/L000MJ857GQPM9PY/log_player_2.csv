"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $175 is above Bob's maximum budget of $150.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about negotiating. $130 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. He has already rejected a higher offer, so there's no reason to accept this one.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, and Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal price.  Offering $140 shows he's willing to compromise but still wants a better deal than Alice's last offer. It's a reasonable increase from his previous counteroffer, leaving room for a final agreement in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $155 is tempting, it's still above Bob's ideal price. He's already been successful in pushing the price down, and with several rounds left, he can try to secure a deal closer to his desired $150. There's still potential to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his maximum budget of $150.  He needs to make a final push to get Alice to accept.  There's a good chance she'll accept, as it's her floor price.  If not, he can always buy from John in the next round, as it will be his last chance to save money."
