"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but lower than your maximum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my desired price point, but it's getting closer. There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still a little above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we settle on $1,175,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. We're in the middle ground now.  Considering that we only have 5 rounds left, it's probably better to accept the offer.  It's possible we could negotiate a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and I might have to buy from John at a much higher price."
