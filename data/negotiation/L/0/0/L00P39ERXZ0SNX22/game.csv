"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still a little above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we settle on $1,175,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
