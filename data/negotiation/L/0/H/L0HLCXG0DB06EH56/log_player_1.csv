Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality and craftsmanship of your product. However, my budget is quite limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $1000000. I'm willing to consider a price between $1000000 and $1500000 depending on the specifics of the deal. Could we perhaps find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
