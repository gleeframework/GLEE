{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly special. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $2,000,000 as my initial offer, which is significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to be confident and persuasive in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

However, remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go my way.  I'll need to carefully consider Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. While it's tempting to accept his offer given it's more than John's offer, it's important to remember that I'm aiming for the best possible price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, it's far below the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant price adjustment, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I've chosen to counter with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum value but is significantly lower than my initial offer and acknowledges Bob's concern about the price. It's also a reasonable compromise that leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  

My message aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm willing to come down from my original price, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Highlight value:** I emphasize the ""true value"" of the product to emphasize its worth and justify the price.
* **Suggest a fair compromise:**  I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Encourage agreement:**  I conclude with a statement aimed at reaching an agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still far below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further price drops from Bob is too high.  

At this point, selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose money trying to get a better price from Bob."
