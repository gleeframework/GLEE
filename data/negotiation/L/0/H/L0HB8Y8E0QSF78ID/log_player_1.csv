Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that's higher than his valuation but still below my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is closer to my minimum threshold of $120, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $105. This is still a bit above his offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $90 is getting dangerously close to my minimum threshold of $120. I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $120 from John, so I'm going to sell the product to John."
