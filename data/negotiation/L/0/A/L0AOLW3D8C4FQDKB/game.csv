"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I'm interested in your product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in your product, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I've given this some thought, and while I value making a deal, I can't accept $850,000.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and its potential to benefit you greatly.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in this product. Let's find common ground and reach a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
