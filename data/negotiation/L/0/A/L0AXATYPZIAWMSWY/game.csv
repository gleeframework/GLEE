"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, $500000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it provides, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to discuss the price. After careful consideration, I am proposing a revised price of $650000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the market value, while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin. I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, $650000 is still a bit lower than I can comfortably accept. To make this deal work, I'd need to see a price closer to $750000.  This price is still significantly lower than my initial budget and allows for a healthy margin for both of us. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. After evaluating the situation more closely, I am prepared to offer the product at a price of $700000. This still represents a substantial discount compared to the market value, but I believe it is a fair compromise that allows for a decent profit margin. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and we can finalize the transaction.",700000.0,Alice,5,
