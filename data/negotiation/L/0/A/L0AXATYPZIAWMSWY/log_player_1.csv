Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, $500000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it provides, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this offer further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

After careful consideration, I am proposing a revised price of $650,000 for the product.

I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 650000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, $650000 is still a bit lower than I can comfortably accept. To make this deal work, I'd need to see a price closer to $750000.  This price is still significantly lower than my initial budget and allows for a healthy margin for both of us. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial agreement.

After evaluating the situation more closely, I am prepared to offer the product at a price of $700,000.
