"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's a valuable item for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* You want to save as much money as possible.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,250 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. 
* While I could continue to counter-offer, it's likely Alice will be stubborn and I'm not sure if I can get her to go lower.
* To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I'll buy the product from John for $12,000, which is my limit and saves me money compared to Alice's offer."
