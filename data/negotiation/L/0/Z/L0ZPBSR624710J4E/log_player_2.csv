"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, considering its worth is no less than $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, so you gain no benefit by buying from her. Since you have a guaranteed alternative (buying from John for the same price), rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to potentially find a better deal."
