"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than $500,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and the benefits it will bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we make the deal at $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",675000.0,Alice,7,
