"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While I value your business, I'm still a bit higher than $850,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
