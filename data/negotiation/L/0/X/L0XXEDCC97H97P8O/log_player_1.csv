"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $170, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation around a higher price point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it might make a counteroffer closer to my desired range more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's willingness to counter means he's interested. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $145?"", ""product_price"": 145}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Incremental Concessions:** By making a smaller concession than Bob, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at any price. This keeps the door open for him to make further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100, giving me a decent profit.
* **Time Value:**  We're four rounds in. While I could push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While John offers a guaranteed $100, accepting Bob's offer gives me a higher potential profit."
