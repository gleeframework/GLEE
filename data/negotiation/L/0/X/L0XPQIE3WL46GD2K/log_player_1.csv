Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering it for more than $150 guarantees Bob will reject it. I need to stay below his valuation while still aiming high."
