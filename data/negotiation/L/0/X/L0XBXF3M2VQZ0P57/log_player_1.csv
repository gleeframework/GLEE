Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, so I want to get as close to Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Risk/Reward:** Offering $950,000 balances the risk of Bob rejecting and the reward of a high sale price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $800,000 is a safety net, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for counteroffers and further negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my ideal price, and I believe there is still room for negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can control the next move and potentially push him closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** While $800,000 is a safe option, I'm not yet ready to accept a price that is so far below my initial target. 

**Next Move:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My previous offer of $950,000 was rejected, so I'm willing to compromise a bit, but not too much. 
* **Midpoint Strategy:**  $925,000 represents a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a favorable price.
* **Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to either accept a price closer to my initial target or risk losing the deal altogether. 

**Next Move:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider the next steps. I will analyze Bob's counteroffer and his negotiation style to determine whether I should continue negotiations, accept his offer, or finally settle for John's price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can still get a better deal.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** Bob's offer suggests he's willing to negotiate, and I still have room to counter without risking losing the deal to John.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By continuing to negotiate, I can potentially secure a price closer to $900,000, which is more appealing than accepting $875,000.

**Next Move:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm pushing for my target price of $900,000.  This is a strong position to take, showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While there's a risk that Bob will reject this final offer, I've strategically lowered my price point to make it more appealing to him. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, especially if Bob values the product at $1,000,000.

**Next Move:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully evaluate his next move and decide whether to accept his counteroffer or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my desired price, and it's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Risk of Further Rejection:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of further rejection, potentially leaving me with a lower final price or no deal at all.
* **Safety Net:** John's offer of $800,000 provides a safe and secure option that meets my minimum price requirement.

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, securing a sale to John at $800,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
