{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 137.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd rather sell to Bob, it's not worth it to continue negotiating at this point. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
