"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still maximizing my potential profit.  It also shows Bob that I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $775,000? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try to push for a bit more before considering selling to John. There are still a few rounds left and I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $790,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $790,000. How about $785,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $785,000 is tempting, I think I can get closer to my target with another counteroffer.  I have a few rounds left before I need to consider selling to John, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $785,000 is a fair offer, but I'm willing to go down to $788,000.  This is a small difference, but it allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 788000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $788,000. How about $795,000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $795,000 is only $5,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might not be willing to negotiate further. Given the limited rounds, it's better to secure this deal than risk losing a sale altogether."
