Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows a small buffer for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a profit if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120 provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential profit."
