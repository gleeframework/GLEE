"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $137.50",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $137.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $115. I can do $130, and that's as low as I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,
