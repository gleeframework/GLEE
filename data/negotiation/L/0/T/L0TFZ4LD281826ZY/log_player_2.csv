Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering its potential value.
