"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To move things forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering its potential value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This feels like a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial limitations. Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
