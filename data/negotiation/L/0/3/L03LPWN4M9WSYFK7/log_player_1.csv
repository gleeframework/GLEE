{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, leaving some room for negotiation. It also communicates your minimum value for the product to set a baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $115 is better than nothing, it is significantly below the product's worth to me. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling it to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there. How about $122?  It's a good compromise and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $122 is very close to my minimum price of $120. It's a good compromise and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
