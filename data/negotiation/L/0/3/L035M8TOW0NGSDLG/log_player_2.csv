"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that could be incredibly valuable for your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I believe the potential returns will be substantial. Let's discuss this further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject the offer and purchase from John for a lower price."
