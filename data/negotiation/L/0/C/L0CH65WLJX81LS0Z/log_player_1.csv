Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and gives you insight into his perception of the product's value.  
* **Potential for significant profit:** If Bob accepts, you've secured a $400,000 profit over your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer.  You'll need to decide how much you're willing to risk for a potentially higher profit."
