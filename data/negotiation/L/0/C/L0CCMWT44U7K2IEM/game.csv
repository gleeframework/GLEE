"I understand that $100 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $130? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this great product.",125.0,Alice,5,
