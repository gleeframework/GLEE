Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a profit.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $10,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I believe this is a reasonable price, considering Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to push for $9,500, it's not worth risking a deal with John. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
