Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than Bob's value of $8,000, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, while still ensuring you earn a decent profit.  If Bob rejects, you can then sell to John for $12,000."
