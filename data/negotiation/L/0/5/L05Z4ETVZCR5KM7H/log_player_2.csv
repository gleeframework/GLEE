Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe the product is worth more to you than $700,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is very close to my target price of $700,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance that Alice could become more rigid in her stance. Additionally, I risk running out of rounds before I can secure a deal. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the deal altogether."
