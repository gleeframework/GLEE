{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to try to negotiate a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly lowering the price, aiming to establish a reasonable starting point.  Offering 75% of the initial price is a bold move, but it's necessary to signal that you are serious about buying the product but won't overpay. This also leaves room for negotiation throughout the remaining rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $1,500,000, it's still above your desired price. You have 7 rounds left, so continuing the negotiation process gives you more opportunities to bring the price down closer to your target."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. It shows a willingness to meet halfway while still remaining within your budget. With only 4 rounds left, it's important to move towards a final agreement. This offer leaves room for a slight adjustment in the next round if needed, potentially securing a successful negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting very close to your budget, there's still a chance to improve the deal. Rejecting this offer gives you one more round to potentially negotiate a lower price, potentially getting closer to your desired $1,000,000. There's still a chance for a better outcome, so taking this last shot at negotiation makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final offer. It's exactly your budget limit and signals to Alice that you are serious about purchasing the product but won't go higher.  Given that there are only 2 rounds left, this move is strategic and leaves the decision in Alice's hands. If she rejects, you can always go with John's offer, which guarantees you the product at your desired price. This creates pressure on Alice to accept your offer or risk losing the sale entirely."
