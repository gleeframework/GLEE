,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. Can you consider meeting me at $92? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible.",92.0,Bob,4,
