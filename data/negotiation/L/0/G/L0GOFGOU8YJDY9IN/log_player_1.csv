Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This way, I maximize my potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and is also below the value of the product to him.  I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum, I've already had two rounds of negotiation and Bob is showing a pattern of lowballing. I'm not confident that he'll raise his offer much further.  It's better to secure the sale with John and guarantee the $12,000."
