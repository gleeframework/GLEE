"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the price I've been told John is willing to sell it to me for. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's keep the conversation going.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,225,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant concession from my previous offer. I hope we can reach an agreement on this price.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,212,500. This is as close to my target price as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1212500.0,Bob,6,
