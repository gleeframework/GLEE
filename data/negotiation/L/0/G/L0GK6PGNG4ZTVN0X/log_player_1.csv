Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we have another buyer (John) willing to pay the full $800,000.  There's no point in risking Bob walking away in further rounds when we have a guaranteed sale at our desired minimum with John."
