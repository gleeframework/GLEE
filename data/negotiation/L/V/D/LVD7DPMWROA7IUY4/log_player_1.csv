"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm still paying a premium. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $9,750 is a good price and gets me closer to my desired goal.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to settle for the lower price from John."
