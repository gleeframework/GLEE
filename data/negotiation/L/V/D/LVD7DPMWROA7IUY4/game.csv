"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm still paying a premium.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
