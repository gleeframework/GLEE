Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position but $9,000 is too low for me. Could you do $13,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I can tell you're serious about the product. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000. Since your maximum is $10,000 and you have the option to buy from John at that price, it's best to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
