Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway since the product is worth $8000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I still think I can get more than $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us and would still allow you a good margin for profit."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, $9,000 is a good compromise and still a decent profit for me.  It's better than selling to John and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
