"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price that reflects its exceptional value. I'm confident it will be a significant asset for your business. My offer is $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum value ($800,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a significant profit margin.
* **Clear Communication:** My message is concise, straightforward, and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, and I have 9 more rounds to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:** I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on something closer to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's room for improvement. Bob is clearly interested, and I can try to bridge the gap further. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have the upper hand by rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer. It shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away. 
* **Time Remaining:** I still have 8 rounds to reach a better agreement, making rejection a calculated risk.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $950,000, explaining that it's a fair compromise considering the product's value and our time invested in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 doesn't fully reflect the value of this product.  Considering its unique features and potential, I believe $950,000 is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's meet halfway and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not by too much. This shows flexibility without caving in.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's unique features and potential to reinforce its worth.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Framing:**  This phrase suggests a collaborative approach, making the offer more appealing.
* **Time Awareness:**  I'm still early in the negotiation process, so there's room for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested in reaching an agreement.  Would you consider $900,000? That feels like a fair price that reflects the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 away from my desired price point of $950,000. 
* **Risk of Further Rejection:** There's a risk that my counteroffer will be rejected again, potentially leading to a lower price or a longer negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, and I want to avoid getting stuck in a protracted negotiation.
* **Secure Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a significant profit of $100,000, which is much better than selling to John for $800,000. 

**Conclusion:**  The potential gains from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this stage."
