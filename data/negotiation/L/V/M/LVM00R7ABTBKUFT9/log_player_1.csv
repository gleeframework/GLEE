Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  The offer is still attractive to Bob, but it's not so low that he'll instantly accept. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions the offer as a good deal for Bob. 
* **John as a Backup:** The fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage. I can always walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I can still try to negotiate a better price. I have leverage knowing John is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Exploring further:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Appealing to value:**  I emphasize the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $1,075,000 is still a good deal.
* **Flexibility:**  By offering a middle ground, I show that I'm willing to compromise while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Avoiding John for now:**  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  I want to see if I can reach an agreement with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,075,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about $950,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **John remains a strong backup:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I know I can get $1,500,000 from John.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target. 

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still shows that I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to sell and you to get this valuable product at a competitive price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it still represents a significant compromise.
* **Fair and reasonable:** I frame the offer as a fair compromise to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Appeal to value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Building towards a deal:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a final agreement, but I'm still prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000. This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell at $1,000,000.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even though Bob increased his offer, $975,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result:**  It seems unlikely that Bob will offer a significantly higher price, and I'm not willing to compromise further.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $1,500,000. It's a much safer option than risking further negotiation with Bob.

Therefore, it's best to accept John's offer and move on."
