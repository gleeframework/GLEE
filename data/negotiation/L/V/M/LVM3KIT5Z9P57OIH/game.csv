"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know your thoughts on this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial price. This still allows me to achieve a fair return while potentially making this a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1250000 for this product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1600000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's make this deal work for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $1600000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
