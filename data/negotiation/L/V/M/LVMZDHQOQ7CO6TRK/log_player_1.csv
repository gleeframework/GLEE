"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm confident in the product's value, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a higher price than his offer.  I hope he sees the value of the product and accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a better price. There are still rounds left and I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500. It's a small step down from my last offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. With only 5 rounds left, I'm getting closer to John's offer, so I need to get serious about closing this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $17,000, I believe I can still get a better price. There are still 4 rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for a price that is too far below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500.  This is a serious offer - I'm getting very close to John's offer.  It's a last chance for Bob to make a deal.  If he rejects this, I'll be forced to accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  

There's only one round left and I don't think I can get Bob to come up to my desired price. I've tried to negotiate, but I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John than risk losing out on any money."
