"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the potential of the product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000 for this deal to work. Let's split the difference and find a solution that's fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
