{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than my absolute maximum. This is to signal my serious intent to negotiate but also show that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. While I'm getting closer, I'm not willing to pay more than $1,200,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John at my maximum budget."
