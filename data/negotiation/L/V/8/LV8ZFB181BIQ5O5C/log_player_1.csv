While I could push Bob further, accepting his offer of $1,600,000 is the most strategic decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob could lead to a stalemate or him walking away. John's offer provides a safety net, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a good profit now.
* **Bob's Firmness:** Bob has been consistent in staying around the $1,600,000 mark, suggesting this is his upper limit. 
 
Therefore, securing a profitable deal with Bob outweighs the potential risk of continuing negotiations or accepting John's offer."
