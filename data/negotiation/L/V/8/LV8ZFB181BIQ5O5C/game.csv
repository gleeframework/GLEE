"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $2,000,000 to start the negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am not able to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,750,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price better aligns with what I am willing to spend while still recognizing the value of the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be a bit firmer on the price. How about we settle at $1,675,000?  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,675,000. I would like to make one last counteroffer at $1,600,000. This is the highest I can go while still respecting my budget constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
