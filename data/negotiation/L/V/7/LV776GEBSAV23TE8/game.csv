"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your product, but I am unable to go above $8,000. Could we possibly meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,500 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping you see the value in that. Let's try to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
