,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price might have been a little high, but $60 is too low for me.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit much for my budget. Would you consider $70? I think that's a fair offer.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product.  How about $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I can't go higher than $80.  That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a good deal. What do you say?",80.0,Bob,6,
