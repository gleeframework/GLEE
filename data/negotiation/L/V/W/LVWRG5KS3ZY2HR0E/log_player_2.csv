"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

You're still looking to save more money.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is worth a shot, but keep in mind that you can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fall apart."
