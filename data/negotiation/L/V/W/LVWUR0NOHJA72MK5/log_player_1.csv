I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to me and $12,000 to Bob. This gives us both room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll counter with $14,000. It's still above Bob's offer, but closer to his value, hopefully creating a better chance for a deal."

Bob's offer is now below my minimum value. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
