Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value and the existence of other buyers to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $10,000, the message implies a willingness to negotiate.  

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining a realistic chance of securing a deal with Bob."
