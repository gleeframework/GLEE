Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **High but Reasonable:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. It allows you to gauge his interest.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always come down slightly. However, never go below $15,000 as you have a guaranteed sale at that price with John."
