"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $8000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the benefits it offers, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10500. It's a fair price that takes into account the market value and our previous discussion.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $10500. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
