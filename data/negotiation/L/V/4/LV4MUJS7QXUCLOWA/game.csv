"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we work towards a price that suits both of us?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given the product's value and my budget, I believe $10,000 remains the maximum I could realistically consider. Would there be any possibility to negotiate further?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, taking anything less than $11,000 would be difficult for me. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but unfortunately, $11,000 is still beyond my budget. I'd like to stay within $10,000 if possible. Is there any flexibility in your offer?",10000.0,Bob,6,
