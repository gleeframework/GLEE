Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference you can negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant share of the potential profit while still being attractive to Bob.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's concise, acknowledges the product's value to Bob, and sets a clear timeframe to create a sense of urgency.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place (e.g., your walk-away point) is crucial.
* **Information is Power:**  In a real-world scenario, you'd ideally want more information about Bob's needs, constraints, and alternatives. This would allow for a more tailored and potentially even more profitable negotiation."
