Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value, I propose a price of $12000 for it. I believe this is a fair deal that allows us both to gain from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To try to accommodate your needs while still achieving a fair price for our product, I would like to propose a price of $11500. This is higher than your offer but lower than my initial proposal, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle.
