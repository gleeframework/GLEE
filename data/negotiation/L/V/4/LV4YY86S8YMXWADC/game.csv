"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that could greatly benefit your business. Considering its value, I propose a price of $12000 for it. I believe this is a fair deal that allows us both to gain from this transaction.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To try to accommodate your needs while still achieving a fair price for our product, I would like to propose a price of $11500. This is higher than your offer but lower than my initial proposal, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both parties.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $11000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
