Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob at $1,750,000. This is a price higher than what it's worth to him but significantly lower than my minimum value. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While not my ideal price, it's still a good profit for me.
* **Initiate negotiation:** It's a starting point for negotiation, giving Bob a chance to counteroffer.
* **Keep the door open for John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my desired price.

By starting high but not unreasonable, I hope to encourage Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Potential for a better price:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested. 
* **Risk of losing John:**  While $1,400,000 is not bad, I don't want to risk losing out on the $1,500,000 John is offering.  

By rejecting and counteroffering, I'm keeping both options open - a better deal with Bob or a guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,600,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Closer to my goal:** It's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Appealing to Bob:** It's a reasonable step down from my previous offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:** It's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving me some leverage in the negotiation.

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and potentially closing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm disappointed that negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a higher price, I've reached a point where it's not worth risking further negotiation. Here's why:

* **Risk of further price reduction:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal.  I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to even lower offers.
* **Time and effort:** Continued negotiation takes time and effort. I'm not convinced that the potential for a higher price justifies this.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $1,500,000.  This is a reliable and secure outcome.

By selling to John, I'm choosing a known quantity over the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
