"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. You have 10 rounds to work with, and Alice is likely motivated to sell since the product is worth more to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to establish a clear negotiation range.  By offering $700,000, I'm pushing Alice to consider a price closer to my budget, while still showing I'm serious about purchasing the product. This also leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm only two rounds in, and I have room to negotiate further. I'm not yet at a point where I'd be willing to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise while still staying within my preferred price range. This should encourage Alice to consider my offer and potentially lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still not within the range I'm comfortable with.  I have time and still have a viable alternative in John. I'll continue to negotiate, aiming to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm pushing for my target price, which is also what John is offering. If Alice rejects this, I'll immediately move to purchase from John. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential benefit of saving a few thousand dollars.  I want to secure the product before I run out of time."
