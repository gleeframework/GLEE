"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above his maximum budget. It's worth seeing if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is aiming to get the product for his maximum price point of $10,000. This is a bold counteroffer, but it establishes Bob's firm budget and sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $12,000, which is still within Bob's budget. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially going back up in price exists. It's a better strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal entirely."
