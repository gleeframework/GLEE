Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" statement and the relatively small increase suggest he might not be willing to go much higher. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer."
