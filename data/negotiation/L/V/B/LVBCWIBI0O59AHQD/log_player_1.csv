Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit, but also want to avoid a drawn-out process or risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price. I don't want to sell to John yet, as I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a profit. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Bob might not come back with another counteroffer, or might even decide to drop out of the negotiation altogether.  Selling to John guarantees me $8,000, but Bob's offer is slightly better and closer to my desired profit margin. I'm going to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
