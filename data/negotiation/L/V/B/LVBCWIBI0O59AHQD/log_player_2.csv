"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's value:** Alice values the product at $8,000. This means she's willing to sell for anything above that.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, but wants to pay less.
* **Negotiation room:** There's a $2,000 difference between their values. This gives Bob room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get closer to Alice's $8,000 valuation while still staying within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's within Bob's budget:** $8,500 is still below Bob's $10,000 maximum price.
* **It's a significant discount:** It's $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Alice might not accept this right away, but it gives her a lower price to consider while still being profitable for her.

Bob should be prepared to negotiate further if Alice rejects this counteroffer, but it's a strong starting point to try and secure a favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's value:** Alice is willing to sell for more than $8,000, but is now offering $9,000. This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **Bob's value:** Bob is still looking for a lower price than $9,000.
* **Negotiation room:** There is still room for Bob to negotiate. Alice moved closer to his desired price, but there's still room to potentially get a better deal.

By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the negotiation open and can make another counteroffer to try and get the price down further. While buying from John is an option, Bob can potentially save more by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from his previous counteroffer, showing he is willing to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer and is within Bob's budget.

Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **Shows compromise:**  By increasing the offer slightly, Bob demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer avoids a stalemate and keeps the conversation going towards a potential deal.
* **Still within Bob's budget:**  $8,750 is still a good price for Bob, leaving room for potential savings.

While Alice might reject this counteroffer again, this approach allows Bob to show seriousness without compromising his financial goals."
