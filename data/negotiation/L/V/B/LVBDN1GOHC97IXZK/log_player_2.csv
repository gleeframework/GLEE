"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's still above his target of saving money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price below $150 and is confident he can negotiate a lower price than Alice's initial offer.  Offering $120 is a significant reduction, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will raise the price again or that Bob will run out of rounds before getting a satisfactory price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
