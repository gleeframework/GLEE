Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $130 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts by acknowledging Bob's potential interest and then offering a price that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of a counteroffer and a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  There's still room for negotiation and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $122? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $122 is still a bit below my preferred price, it's getting closer.  Since Bob seems determined to stick around $120,  it's better to accept his offer and secure the sale.  There's always a chance he'll go lower in the next round, but it's a risk that's not worth taking at this point."
