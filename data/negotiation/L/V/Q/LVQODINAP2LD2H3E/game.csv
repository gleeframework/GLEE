"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  It's a fair price considering your value is much higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise considering the value I have in the product and the value it holds for you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,500 at this point.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you is $8,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product, which is a good price considering the value it holds for me and the fact that I'm paying more than John's offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
