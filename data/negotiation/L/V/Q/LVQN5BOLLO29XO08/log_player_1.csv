Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it's designed to test the waters and see how much Bob values the product.  I'm confident in the product's value, and this high price gives me room to negotiate if necessary. 

If Bob rejects, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and consider whether I want to continue negotiating or sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price point that reflects the value of the product. I believe this offer is appealing enough to Bob to incentivize a deal while still providing me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and higher than John's offer.  At this point, I'm willing to close the deal to avoid further negotiation and risk of losing the sale altogether."
