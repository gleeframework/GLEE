"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value of the product to me.  It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a high value. This counteroffer signals that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but only slightly.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm flexible but also that I'm still aiming for a higher price than his last offer. The time is ticking, and I need to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm only $50,000 above John's offer. However, I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
