Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is still a bit higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's closer to my value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is close enough to my desired price point and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob backing out.  It's also higher than the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
