While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is a good business decision at this point:

* **Solid Profit:**  It's considerably above my minimum selling price ($1,200,000).
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I have the capital sooner rather than later, which has its own value.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much more, and there's a risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away."
