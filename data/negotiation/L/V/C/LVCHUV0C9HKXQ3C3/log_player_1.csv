"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong opening offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to his maximum.
* **Leaving Room:**  We don't want to start too close to Bob's perceived value, as this leaves little room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that this is not a take-it-or-leave-it offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below our minimum acceptable price. While we want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table. We are willing to negotiate, but not at this level.  We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must admit, it's a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  This product truly holds significant value, and I believe a price of $1,120,000 is a more accurate reflection of that.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,120,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,085,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally moving towards a more agreeable price, but we're still significantly above our minimum and believe there's room for further negotiation. We'll counter slightly above our floor to signal our willingness to close, but not at a major loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and show Bob we're serious about closing the deal.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession by dropping to $1,100,000, which is only slightly above our absolute minimum. This might be enough to sway Bob while still securing a good profit.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating fairness and the product's value to remind Bob of why this price is justified. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and the risk of losing the deal entirely."
