"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must admit, it's a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  This product truly holds significant value, and I believe a price of $1,120,000 is a more accurate reflection of that.  What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,120,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,085,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement.",1085000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
