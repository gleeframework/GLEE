Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he's potentially willing to pay anything below that.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secured at $1,000,000 (from John), so aiming higher than that is key. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $1,400,000 gives Bob a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you. This leaves room for negotiation downwards if Bob hesitates, while still staying comfortably above your minimum."
