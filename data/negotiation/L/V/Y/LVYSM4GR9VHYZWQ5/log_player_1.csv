Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my target price of $12,000, as that's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, he may reject this offer. But I'm hoping he'll see the value and be willing to negotiate.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer is too low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low for me. While it's closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm still making a profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer and finally agree to purchase the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant compromises, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  To avoid further negotiations, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
