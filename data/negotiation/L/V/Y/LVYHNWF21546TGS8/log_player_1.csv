"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to test the waters and see how much Bob is willing to pay.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $1,600,000.  This is still a high price, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my minimum value while still leaving some room for him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm serious about making a deal with him. It's a significant compromise, but I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I've already lowered my price significantly, and it doesn't seem like he's willing to budge. I've reached my limit for negotiation, and I don't want to risk going further down and losing out on a better deal. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
