"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it's a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is far above Bob's budget, and he can get the product from John for a significantly lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as there's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to benefit from this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.  He can potentially get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting any closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $950,000 is my final offer.  If you're serious about this deal, we need to find a middle ground.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $950,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. Bob has a few rounds left, and with some negotiation, he might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that we're nearing the end of our negotiation.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but we need to split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's finalize this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting very close to Bob's target, it's still not within his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice, as there's potential to get a better deal with only three rounds left.  He can also choose to buy from John, but that might be a premature decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'll offer $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us both to reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 912500}
