"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6500. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",6500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $5500. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $5500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $6000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $6000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $5800. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",5800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $5800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $5900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",5900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $5900 and $5800, so I'll offer $5850. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",5850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $5850. I'm willing to make one more small concession and offer you the product for $5920. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",5920.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $5850. I think that's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",5850.0,Bob,8,
