Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  It's also important to remember I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any point, so there's no risk in starting high."
