"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches the product's value to you, there's no incentive to accept it immediately.  You can try to get a better price. Since you have John as a backup willing to sell at that price, you don't lose anything by rejecting Alice's initial offer."
