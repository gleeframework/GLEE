"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $170?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",170.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $170. How about $145? Can you consider that?,145.0,Bob,4,
