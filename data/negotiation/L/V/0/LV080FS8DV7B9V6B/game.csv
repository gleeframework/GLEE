"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little too high at $10000 though. How about $9000?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10000, so I'll sell the product to you for $9500.",9500.0,Alice,5,
