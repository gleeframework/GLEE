"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are only willing to pay $100 maximum, and you can get it from John. So, rejecting the offer and potentially making a counteroffer in the next round is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum offer of $100. This is the price I'm willing to pay and the price I can get from John. I'm hoping Alice will accept, but I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above my maximum of $100. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't go higher than my maximum.  I still have the option of buying from John for $100, so I don't need to settle for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $105. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and I'm willing to pay a little more than my absolute minimum. However, I'm still keeping the offer below Alice's last offer and below the price I can get from John.  This gives Alice an incentive to accept, while still protecting my interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $115 is still too high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get her down further.  I still have the option of buying from John for $100, so I'm not in a rush to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly to $110. I'm trying to meet Alice halfway, showing her I'm serious about a deal, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price. It's getting close to the point where I might accept, but I'll see what Alice does first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my target price of $100.  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely she will drop to a price I'm willing to pay. To avoid further negotiation and potential for a higher price, I'll buy from John for $100. I'm happy to get the product at my target price and avoid the risk of a higher price."
