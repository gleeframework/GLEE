"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can do $108, which is my lowest price for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $108 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  How about $106?  That's a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about we compromise at $107?",107.0,Alice,5,
