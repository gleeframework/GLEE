"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on it.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'm thinking of $1,150,000. It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  It's a fair compromise that keeps us both happy.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,180,000. It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for this exceptional product.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
