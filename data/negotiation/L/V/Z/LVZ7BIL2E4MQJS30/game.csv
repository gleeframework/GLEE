"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $10,200 is close, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the price down to under $10,000, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $9,500. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal.",9800.0,Alice,5,
