"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a significant discount from the original $120. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $95?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer you a price of $105, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
