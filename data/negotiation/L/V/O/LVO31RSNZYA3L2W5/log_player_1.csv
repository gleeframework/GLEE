I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering a price of $12,500. This is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise."

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
