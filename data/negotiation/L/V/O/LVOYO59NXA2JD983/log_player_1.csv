{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot.  I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will counteroffer, allowing for a more profitable outcome. However, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $140 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I still feel that $140 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose $130 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, it seems we're at an impasse.  His offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already made a significant concession, and I don't want to risk losing a sale to John. I'll sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get a decent profit."
