"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9500.0
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I see your point. $9,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to bridge the gap a bit further. Let's meet at $10,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. That's my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",9800.0,Bob,6,,
