"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially start the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $12,000, I leave room for counteroffers and potential negotiation without falling below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to achieve.
* **Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that value with Bob. There's a chance I could get a better price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible while still trying to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, reiterating that I believe the product is a good value.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still hoping to secure a better price with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:** $9,750 is closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price with Bob. If I reject this offer, I can try to close the gap further in the next round.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is attractive, I'm not desperate yet. I'm willing to risk losing a few rounds with Bob if it means potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point. $9,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to bridge the gap a bit further. Let's meet at $10,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer, adding some pressure.
* **Slightly Higher:** I'm only increasing the price by $250 from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to be reasonable.
* **Time is of the Essence:** With limited rounds left, I need to make a decisive move.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I'm optimistic that Bob will accept this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. That's my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation is becoming increasingly risky.
* **Not Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's final offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.  

It's better to secure a guaranteed $15,000 than risk losing more time with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
