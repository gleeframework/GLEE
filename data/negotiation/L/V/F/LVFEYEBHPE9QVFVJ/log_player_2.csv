"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's starting counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within his budget.  This aggressive move aims to quickly establish a lower price point while still leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly, keeping the communication positive while making it clear Bob is serious about getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8,750. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise, coming down from her initial offer.  Bob's goal is to save money, and this price is well within his budget while also being close to his initial counteroffer.  Accepting now avoids further negotiation and the risk of Alice's price going back up."
