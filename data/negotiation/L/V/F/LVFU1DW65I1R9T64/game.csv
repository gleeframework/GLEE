,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000. However, I'm still only able to offer $850,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to pay $850,000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a very good price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is closer, I'm still limited to my budget of $800,000. I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
