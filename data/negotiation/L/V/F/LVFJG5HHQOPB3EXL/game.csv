"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and provides you with a great deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,025,000? This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and still allows you to benefit greatly from the product's value. Let's make this happen!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
