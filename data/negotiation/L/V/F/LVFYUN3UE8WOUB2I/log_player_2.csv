Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider a price of $9500 for the product. This still allows us both to gain value from this transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $8,000.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $9000 for the product. This still represents a significant return for me while providing you with a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob has already been through multiple rounds and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to take the sure thing and buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
