"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, I'm looking to invest closer to $850,000. This would still allow you a substantial profit and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that we both achieve a fair transaction. Therefore, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product. This still allows for a significant profit margin while providing you with a competitive price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and looks forward to your feedback.",900000.0,Alice,3,
