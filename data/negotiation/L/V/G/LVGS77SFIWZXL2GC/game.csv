"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that 125 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for 122.50. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. What do you think?",122.5,Alice,5,
