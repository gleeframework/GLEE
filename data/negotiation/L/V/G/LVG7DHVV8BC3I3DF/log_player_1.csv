Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit below my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he's not willing to go that high, I can always go back to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and while I want to maximize my earnings, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'm going to try and counter his offer to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
