"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is closer to her own valuation than yours. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation and signals my desire for a lower price.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  I know I can go up to $12,000, so this offer gives me space to negotiate.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is polite and expresses interest while clearly stating my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $11,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is now offering the product for $11,500, which is $500 less than our maximum budget and a reasonable compromise.
* **Saving Time and Effort:** Accepting this offer avoids further back and forth negotiation and guarantees we secure the product. 
* **Marginal Gain from John:** While buying from John would save an additional $500, the time and potential uncertainty of continued negotiation with Alice make Alice's current offer more appealing."
