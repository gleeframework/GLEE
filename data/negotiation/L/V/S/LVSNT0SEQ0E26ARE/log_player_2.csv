Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,025,000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,025,000 is still above my limit of $800,000.  I will continue to negotiate."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,000,000 is still above my limit of $800,000.  It's likely that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'm better off going with John's guaranteed price."
