"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,025,000.  This price is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
