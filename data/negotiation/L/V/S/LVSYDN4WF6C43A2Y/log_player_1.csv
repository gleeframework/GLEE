Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, who values the product significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob specifically, making it more appealing.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
