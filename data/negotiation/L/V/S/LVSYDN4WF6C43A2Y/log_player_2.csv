"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget and leaves little room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.
* You can then try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed with buying from John for $1,200,000, which is your absolute upper limit."
