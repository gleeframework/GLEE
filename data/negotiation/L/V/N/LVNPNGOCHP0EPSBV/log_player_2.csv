"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He's willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Bob is aiming for a significant discount and starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $105 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to his limit.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly tone, showing that Bob is interested in a deal but is also firm on his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's original offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a price closer to his limit, and rejecting this offer allows him to continue the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $108. Let's split the difference and find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is making a small counteroffer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a better price. 
* **""Split the Difference"" Strategy:**  This phrase suggests a willingness to compromise and encourages Alice to meet him halfway.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement."
