Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far more than his maximum budget of $12,000.  He should try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
