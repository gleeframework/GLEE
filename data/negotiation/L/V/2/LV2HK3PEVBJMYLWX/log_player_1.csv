Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer you can use:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. Since you have a strong alternative with John, you can be a bit bolder in your initial offer.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **High but Reasonable:** The $1,400,000 price gives you a significant gain over John's offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests you're open to discussing the price further, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower in the ZOPA. 
* **Relationship Value:** Is a long-term business relationship with Bob more important than maximizing profit on this single sale? If so, a more moderate initial offer might be wise."
