Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing it's more than Bob is willing to pay. This gives me room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll see if he'll counteroffer, and if not, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am unable to meet you halfway. I would like to propose $130 as my counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$130 is still above my minimum price of $150, and it's getting closer to what I want.  I'll accept Bob's offer and avoid risking that he'll walk away or I'll be forced to sell to John for my minimum price."
