"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows his maximum budget is $8,000.  He starts by offering the lowest possible price, hoping to catch Alice off guard and potentially secure a quick deal. If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his offer in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $10,000 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his ideal $8,000. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting closer to his target price. If Alice doesn't budge, Bob can always purchase the product from John for his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer. He's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still aiming for a price lower than her last offer.  $9,000 is a reasonable compromise, offering Alice a decent profit while still remaining within Bob's budget. If this offer is rejected, Bob knows he can always go to John, but he's hoping to find a middle ground with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While Bob would prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to pay John $8,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price slightly above his ideal, but still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial asking price of $12,000."
