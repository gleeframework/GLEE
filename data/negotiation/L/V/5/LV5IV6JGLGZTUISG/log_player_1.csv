"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $12,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which is still a great deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $15,000 is my minimum, and I'm happy to close the deal now. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
