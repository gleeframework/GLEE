"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if there's any room for negotiation. This also sets a high baseline for future counteroffers.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, aiming to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open ended question:**  ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** I'm aware that selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm aiming to get closer to my desired $1,000,000 valuation by pushing Bob to make concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than my initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further but I won't settle for anything below my minimum.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, but still above his current offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer to appear more reasonable.
* **Focus on compromise and mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of a ""fair compromise"" and ""benefitting both of us."" This helps to build rapport and encourage Bob to see the value in continuing the negotiation. 
* **Open to further negotiation:**  Ending with ""Let's work together..."" signals that I'm open to continuing the discussion and finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 remains a viable option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer again, but I'll be more firm in my stance, aiming to get closer to my $1,000,000 target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to raise your offer.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but still open to negotiation:** I'm stating my minimum price firmly but still leaving room for a small concession, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for my target.
* **Highlighting the compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the fact that I'm making a ""significant compromise"" to show that I'm being flexible.
* **Expressing confidence in a deal:** Ending with ""Let's make this deal happen"" conveys a sense of optimism and encourages Bob to close the deal."
