Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $150, it's always good to start negotiations a bit higher to leave room for potential counter-offers. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $120  provides a significant profit margin for you (over the $80 John is willing to pay) while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is clear, concise, and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
