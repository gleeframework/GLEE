"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit outside my budget. How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find a buyer who appreciates the product's value.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $122? It's a compromise that still meets my minimum value for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",122.0,Alice,5,
