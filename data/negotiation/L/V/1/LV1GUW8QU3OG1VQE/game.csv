"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000.  This reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I truly believe it's a price that provides value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
