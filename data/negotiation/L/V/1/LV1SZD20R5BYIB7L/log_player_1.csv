I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but it also shows Bob that I value the product highly. I'll be closely watching his response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further. There's potential for a better deal with Bob."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving room for a better deal for myself."
