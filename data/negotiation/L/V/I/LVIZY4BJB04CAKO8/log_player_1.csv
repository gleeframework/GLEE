"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob feel more inclined to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving a $15 buffer between my offer and my minimum acceptable price ($120) to allow for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I need to be more strategic to maximize my profit.  I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great product at a reasonable cost."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the worth of my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, $95 is still too low. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, especially considering that I have the option of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a very fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($95). 
* **Urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""Let's make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm remaining positive and encouraging, hoping to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

This counteroffer balances my need to earn as much as possible while acknowledging Bob's budget.  It also shows flexibility, which is crucial for a successful negotiation."
