Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm confident it can generate much more value for you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your position, but the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm open to finding a solution but need to see a more serious commitment from your side. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 - this is a final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options for selling the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking to a price point far above your maximum budget. Her ""final offer"" language and threat to walk away are likely negotiation tactics. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,200,000, which is significantly better than Alice's current offer and saves you a substantial amount of money."
