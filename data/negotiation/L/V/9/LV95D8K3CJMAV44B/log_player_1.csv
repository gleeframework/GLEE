Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. It's very valuable, and I believe it would be of great use to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. A strong initial offer helps gauge his interest level. If he flat out refuses, you can always lower the price or move on to John. 
* **Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $15,000, netting you a $5,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Factors like your relationship with Bob and your knowledge of his negotiation style might influence a different approach."
