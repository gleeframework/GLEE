"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in making a serious offer of $1200000.  I believe this price is fair considering the market and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and rarity, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1320000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
