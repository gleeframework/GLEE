"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $95. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still a little too high.  How about we split the difference at $100? That would be fair to both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
