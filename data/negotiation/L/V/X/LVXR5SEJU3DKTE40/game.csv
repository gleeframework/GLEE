"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal given its potential. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, given my own valuation.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I've considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,250,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it accurately reflects the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm prepared to offer $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our respective positions.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
