{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $70. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  Given the possibility of selling to John for $120, I'll go with that option. It's worth more to me and doesn't risk further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
