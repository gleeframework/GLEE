"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This price would still give you a significant profit and allow me to secure the product within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise.
