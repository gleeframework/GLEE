{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,450,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $1,200,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You're not asking for the full $1,500,000 value to Bob, leaving space for him to feel he's getting a good deal and encouraging him to counteroffer. 
* **It signals your willingness to negotiate:** By offering a price and leaving room for discussion, you show Bob you're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer.  You're in a good position to negotiate further.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial $1,450,000, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $1,375,000 is still a profitable price for you.
* **It's a fair midpoint:** By suggesting the middle ground, you make it seem like a reasonable compromise, making it more likely Bob will accept. 

Let's see if Bob accepts your counteroffer!"
