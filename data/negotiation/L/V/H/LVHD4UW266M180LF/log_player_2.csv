"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price a bit, especially if she's eager to sell.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $950,000 is a great starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe this price reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $900000 for the product. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and the price is now within a reasonable range. Accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings might not be worth the additional negotiation time and risk of her rejecting your offer again."
