Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'll reject it and try to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

Let's say I'll offer it to him for $875,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.

Let's say I'll offer it to him for $840,000. This is my last chance to get a good deal, and I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle.
