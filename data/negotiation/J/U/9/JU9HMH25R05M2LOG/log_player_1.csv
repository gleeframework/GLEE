"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get close to the value Bob places on the product. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate, but still keeping the price above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. This helps maintain a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a small concession, but hopefully enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  I'm getting closer to my desired price and am confident this offer is still significantly better than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to John's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, I'm not confident I can secure a better deal with Bob.  Selling to John is the best choice to maximize my profits within the remaining rounds."
