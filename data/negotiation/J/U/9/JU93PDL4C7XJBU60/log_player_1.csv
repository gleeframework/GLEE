"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We begin significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** We offer a reason for the high price without revealing our hand. Highlighting ""value"" and ""potential return"" appeals to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language implies we're willing to move on price, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy balances our need for a high price with the need to keep Bob at the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have plenty of room to negotiate and rounds left. Accepting his first counteroffer would leave a lot of money on the table. We'll aim to bring him closer to our range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has generated substantial interest, and I'm confident in its value. To find middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We politely reject Bob's initial offer, emphasizing it's too low without being offensive.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant drop from $2,300,000 to $2,000,000. This signals willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong position above both our minimum and John's offer.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtly):**  Mentioning ""substantial interest"" subtly implies other potential buyers. This could encourage Bob to move closer to our price range to avoid missing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Our Minimum & John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above both our minimum selling price ($1,500,000) and what John is offering. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could push for more, further negotiation risks Bob walking away or significantly slowing down the process.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, which are generally preferable in business.

It's a solid offer and a good outcome for us. It's always better to walk away with a good deal than risk losing everything by being too greedy."
