I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit.  I believe it's a fair price for Bob considering he values the product at $8,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,500. This is a compromise, as it's less than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping this is closer to a price we can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough. At this point, I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for $15,000. The potential for further negotiation is high, but I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale and a good profit."
