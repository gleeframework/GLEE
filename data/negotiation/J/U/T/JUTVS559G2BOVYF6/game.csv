"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned we won't be able to reach an agreement.  $790,000 is still quite a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $805,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",805000.0,Alice,7,
