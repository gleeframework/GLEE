"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a good profit for me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you, and a significant saving for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, and I believe I can still push for a better price with Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  $875,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I'm hoping for a better offer in the next round.  Also, I have John as a guaranteed buyer, giving me some leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would have liked to get closer to $900,000,  I'm concerned about running out of rounds and potentially being forced to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely."
