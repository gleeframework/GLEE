Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $715,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go much lower than $715,000.  Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but it also risks Alice taking a harder stance. Accepting at $715,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
