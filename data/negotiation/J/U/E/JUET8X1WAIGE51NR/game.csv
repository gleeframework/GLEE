"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I've done some research and I believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to resist.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to settle for something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at this price. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last counter-offer? That would put us at $712,500.  Do you think that could work?",712500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $715,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",715000.0,Alice,7,
