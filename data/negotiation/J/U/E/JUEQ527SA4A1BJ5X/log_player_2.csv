**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is overselling:**  Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, which you know is not true. This exaggeration suggests she's aiming for a high price.
* **You have a backup:** John offers the product for $1,500,000. While not ideal, it's your safety net, preventing you from overpaying.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and open the possibility for her to come down to a more reasonable price."
