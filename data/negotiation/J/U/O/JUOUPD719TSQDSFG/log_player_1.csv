"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic tone can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation, setting the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** While it's closer than his initial perceived value, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the negotiation. 
* **I have 8 rounds left.** This gives me ample opportunity to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John guarantees a much higher profit.**  While I'm open to working with Bob, I'm not desperate and can easily switch to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500?  That would still give you a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** $10,500 is still a significant distance from Bob's offer, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  Highlighting the value Bob will get at $10,500 encourages him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 6 rounds left to continue negotiating with Bob. It's worth exploring if I can get him closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a much more attractive option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $10,150? I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and his offer ($9,800). 
* **Focus on Fairness:** Emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though I'm open to negotiating, I'm not going to accept such a low price at this point.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I have 4 rounds left. This gives me enough time to continue negotiating and see if I can get Bob closer to a more acceptable price.
* **John's Offer Remains a Backup:** While I'm trying to work with Bob, John's offer is a safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't produce a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference again. How about $10,000?  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($10,150) and his offer ($9,500).
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Again, I'm emphasizing that the price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of a good deal.
* **Moving Towards a Deal:** I'm making progress in the negotiation, and I hope that this offer will finally be acceptable to Bob. However, I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation with only two rounds left.
* **Bob's Offer Still Low:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is willing to pay my full asking price, and I don't want to risk losing that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  
* **Potential for Further Delay:** Even if I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he will continue to counteroffer in the next round, potentially dragging out the negotiation and wasting valuable time.

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
