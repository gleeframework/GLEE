"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It's best to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  A counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Goal:** The goal is to purchase the product for under $100. By starting at $80, even if Alice counteroffers higher, there's a chance of reaching an agreement within budget.
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to keep in mind that John offers the product for $100. This knowledge provides leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $110 remains above your $100 budget.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Knowing you can get the product for $100 from John allows you to negotiate from a stronger position.  

It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower, especially since the product is only worth $120 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to let it go for $95? That's the most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  While remaining polite, it's important to make it clear that your budget is a firm limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** A counteroffer of $95 is a strong position â€“ it's below your maximum budget and offers Alice a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Pressure Point:** This offer puts a bit of pressure on Alice. She now needs to decide if it's worth losing the sale over $15 (remember, her value is $120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unwilling to go below your $100 budget. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John's standing offer of $100 is now the better deal.  

Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to accept."
