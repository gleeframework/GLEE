"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob ($120), but still within a range that might be acceptable given the value of the product to him. 
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Room for negotiation:** By starting high, I leave room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a higher price, if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still above my ideal price. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point by counteroffering. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 provides a fallback option if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $145? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly from the initial offer.
* **Maintaining value:**  $145 is still above Bob's offer, emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and focused on reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Building toward agreement:** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and get closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I really hope we can find a middle ground here. How about $142 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $142 is very close to my desired price, especially considering the limited rounds remaining. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting and counteroffering might result in a lower final price or a stalemate, potentially leading to a sale to John at a lower price. 
* **Time constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and secures a price that is still significantly higher than my minimum."
