"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $120? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",120.0,Alice,3,
