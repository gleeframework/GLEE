Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I could do $14,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
