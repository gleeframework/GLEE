"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth significantly more to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still leaving me with a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want. I have room to negotiate further and can potentially get a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'll try to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me, but it's a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a slight improvement, it's still far below what I'm hoping for. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a significant step down from my previous offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to what the product is worth to me. I'm hoping this will convince Bob that we're close to an agreement and he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and while I could continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a price I'm comfortable with.  Since John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is much closer to my desired value, it's time to secure the sale with him."
