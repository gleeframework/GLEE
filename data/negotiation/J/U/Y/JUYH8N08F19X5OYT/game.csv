,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $140 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $115?  That seems like a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $115 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $130. It's a great price for a high-quality product, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that price is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering the price I can get elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is the lowest price I can accept. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",145.0,Alice,7,
