"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would still provide a good value for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground and move forward.",875000.0,Alice,3,
