Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a point where I can agree, but $1,400,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $1,250,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
