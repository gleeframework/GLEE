"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. You can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  While aiming low, it's important to maintain a polite and respectful tone to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $100 puts you in a position to potentially negotiate a price well below your $120 maximum while still leaving room to increase your offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your acceptable range, $140 is still above your ideal price and your fallback option (John). There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 was a bit low. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  You've now established your maximum price. This makes your position clear to Alice.
* **Compromise:** By suggesting  ""meeting in the middle,"" you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Fallback:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can confidently purchase from John at your desired price."
