"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. We're willing to offer you the product at a price of $11,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  He can counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not willing to go as low as $10,500. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $10,800. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $10,800 is a good deal for him. He's saving $1,200 compared to buying from John, and it's only $300 more than Alice's bottom line.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
