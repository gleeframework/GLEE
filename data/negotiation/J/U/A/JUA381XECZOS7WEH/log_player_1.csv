Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not comfortable with Bob's low offer. I'm going to counter and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's getting closer, but I'm determined to get a price that better reflects the value of the product. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm going to stick with a price of $1,000,000. This price still allows for a good margin for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
