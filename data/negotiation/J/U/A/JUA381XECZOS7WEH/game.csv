"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1,200,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm going to stick with a price of $1,000,000. This price still allows for a good margin for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
