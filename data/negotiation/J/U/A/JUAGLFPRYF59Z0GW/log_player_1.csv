{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final price.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. I'm highlighting the value of the product without mentioning my own minimum value.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a lower price to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* This strategy allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations.
* If Bob rejects my offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

*  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer, which keeps the negotiation open. 
* By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to increase the price.
* I'm still keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This price still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This price is the midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value Bob is getting. It also highlights the fairness of the proposed price.

**Strategy:**

* By making a counteroffer, I'm continuing the negotiation and giving Bob the opportunity to accept a price closer to my target.
* The counteroffer is still within the range that makes sense for both of us, so it's likely to be acceptable to Bob. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to either make another counteroffer or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000 than his previous offers, and it's likely the best I can get from him.
* While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer will still result in a significant profit for me. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer because it's a good compromise that avoids the risk of further negotiations or selling to John for a lower profit.
* Accepting his offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities."
