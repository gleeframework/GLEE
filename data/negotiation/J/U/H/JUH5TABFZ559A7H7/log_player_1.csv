Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  Here's why:

* **My floor:** I know John will pay $1,200,000, so anything above that is profit for me.
* **Potential for more:**  By offering $1,500,000, I'm showing Bob the value I see in the product and leaving room for him to make a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation:** If Bob is serious, he might counter with a lower price. I can then decide if it's worth taking a smaller profit or sticking with John's guaranteed offer."
