"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've personally valued at over a million dollars, and I know it could do the same for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1050000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings, and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
