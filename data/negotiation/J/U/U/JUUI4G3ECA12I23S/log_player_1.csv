Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher offer gives me the chance to earn more.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk that Bob might reject the offer, I'm willing to take that chance for the potential of a larger profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a strategic approach, and the optimal offer will depend on various factors that are unknown in this scenario.  Factors like:

* **How likely is Bob to accept a higher price?**
* **How much time do I have to negotiate?**
* **How confident am I in John's commitment to purchase?**

A more nuanced negotiation strategy might be needed if more information is available."
