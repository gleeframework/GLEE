"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $925,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand you need to make a profit, but I can't go any higher than $910,000. This is a good compromise and allows us to both get a fair deal. Let's close this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $910,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to think about it for a moment. I'll offer you the product for $917,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",917500.0,Alice,7,
