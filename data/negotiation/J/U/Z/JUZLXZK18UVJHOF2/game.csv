"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $762,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",762500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're able to continue the discussion. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $762,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer you a price of $812,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your persistence in finding a solution.  While I respect your position, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we land at $787,500?  It's a slight concession on my part but keeps us moving towards a deal.",787500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $810,000. I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle once again.",810000.0,Alice,7,
