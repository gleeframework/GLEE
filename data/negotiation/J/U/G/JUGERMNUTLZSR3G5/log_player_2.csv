"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing the price further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $600,000. "",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? "",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the details of the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it makes more financial sense to take that deal."
