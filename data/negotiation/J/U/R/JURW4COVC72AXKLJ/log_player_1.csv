{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Is above your minimum:** It ensures you still make a profit and get closer to your ideal price. 

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to accept since it's better than nothing, selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a better outcome. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counteroffer and attempt to reach a compromise closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still leaves some room for profit for me.  Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from your previous offer of $14,000. 
* **Maintain a firm stance:**  The price is still above your minimum, demonstrating you are serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground,"" keeping the conversation open and encouraging Bob to make a further counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $11,500 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you meet your minimum, and potentially allows for more negotiation with Bob in the future if he becomes more flexible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a potentially better deal with Bob, or a guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,500). This shows willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Slightly above your minimum:** While $11,750 is slightly below your minimum, it's a reasonable compromise and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise,"" keeping the negotiation amicable and encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about $11750, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 finally meets your minimum acceptable price.  While you could potentially continue negotiating and aim for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. 

Accepting this offer ensures you get your desired minimum price and avoids the risk of losing a deal completely. You can always try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the future if the opportunity arises."
