"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, which still leaves some room for profit for me.  Let's find a middle ground!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11750? It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure about $11750, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $12000?",12000.0,Bob,6,
