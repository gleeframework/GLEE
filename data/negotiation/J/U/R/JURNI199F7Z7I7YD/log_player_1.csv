"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting high with an offer of $1,500,000.  This sets a strong baseline and signals that I believe the product is valuable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is a test to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, there's ample room to negotiate down in future rounds.

**Strategy:** 

This approach combines a confident opening with a willingness to negotiate. The goal is to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample time to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I prefer a higher price, I can always secure $1,000,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my bargaining power and signaling that I'm serious about getting a fair price. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer meets Bob halfway from my original offer and his counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** It's important to maintain a price point that is still valuable to me, given my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

I'm using a strategic counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving while still ensuring a fair price. This approach aims to find a compromise that's acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 aligns with my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:** While I'd prefer a higher price, the negotiation is already halfway through, and there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to offer this amount in future rounds. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I won't lose out even if I reject Bob's offer.

**Strategy:** 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is a reasonable outcome.  While a higher price would be ideal, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a complete breakdown in negotiations."
