"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way above my budget. It makes sense to negotiate or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation.
* **Staying Within Budget:** My counteroffer keeps me well below my $120 maximum while still leaving some room to negotiate upwards if necessary.
* **Direct & Polite:** The message is clear about my budget limitations while remaining polite and expressing continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above my $120 limit.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a decent gap between her offer and John's price, suggesting further negotiation could be beneficial. 
* **Time Consideration:**  We're only on Round 3, so I have time to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, $140 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct & Respectful:** I acknowledge Alice's compromise and propose a specific price point.
* **Target Price:**  I'm aiming directly for my maximum budget of $120.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By now, Alice knows I have other options, and proposing my best price might encourage her to accept or at least counter closer to my range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120. I can offer you a compromise at $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $130 is only slightly above my target price, and the difference is small enough to justify accepting.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  If I push further and Alice refuses, I might end up having to buy from John anyway.
* **Time Invested:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating, and securing the product now is preferable to potentially missing out."
