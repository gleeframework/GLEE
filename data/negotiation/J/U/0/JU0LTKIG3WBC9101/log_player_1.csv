Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  The minimum you'll accept is $1,000,000 (your deal with John).
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to him.
* **Zone of Agreement:** There's a potential range where both you and Bob benefit â€“ anything between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Since you have a guaranteed sale with John, you're in a strong position.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair offer"" frame the deal positively.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit while giving Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value. 
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but not below your reservation price).
* **One-time Deal:** This assumes a single negotiation.  In real-world scenarios, there might be counter-offers and further discussions."
