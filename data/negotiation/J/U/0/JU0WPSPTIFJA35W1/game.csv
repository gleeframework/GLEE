"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it gives you a chance to secure it before anyone else. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a middle ground.  How about $850,000? It's a fair price that allows you to secure the product without breaking the bank.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000. How about $775,000? It's a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $775,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However,  I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of the product. How about $825,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $795,000? It's a fair price that takes into account the product's value, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and your commitment to securing this product.  $795,000 is very close to what I need. I'm willing to come down slightly to $800,000 to finalize this deal. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,7,
