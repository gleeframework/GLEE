Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buying the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I have 8 more rounds to reach a satisfactory deal, and selling to John is always an option if the negotiation fails."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe there's room for more negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I have 6 more rounds, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target.  Selling to John is always an option if the negotiation fails, but I'm hoping to secure a better deal with Bob."
