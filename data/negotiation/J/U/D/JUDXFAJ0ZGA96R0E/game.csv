"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of this product,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more to you than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that $15,000 is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal at this price, and we can both be happy.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $16,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $16,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16250.0,Alice,5,
