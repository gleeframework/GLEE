"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I hope you can understand my position.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a significant profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still aiming for a bit more savings.  I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit, while still staying within my budget.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to save a bit more, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my profit margin. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
