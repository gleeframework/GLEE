**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer.  At $1,150,000, I'm saving $50,000 compared to John's price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of the deal falling apart or Alice becoming less flexible increases. Accepting her offer secures the product at a good price."
