Round 3

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price point well above your maximum budget.  Her concessions are getting smaller, and she's indicated this is her final offer.  It's very unlikely she'll come down to a price you're willing to pay.  To avoid wasting further time and potentially missing out, it's time to exercise your backup option and buy from John for $800,000."
