Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal! I'm willing to meet you at $155, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $155, and it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price for potentially several more rounds. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
