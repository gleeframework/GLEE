"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,150,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,225,000? This would ensure a fair outcome for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,225,000, so I'm offering $1,187,500 for the product. This is my final offer.",1187500.0,Bob,4,
