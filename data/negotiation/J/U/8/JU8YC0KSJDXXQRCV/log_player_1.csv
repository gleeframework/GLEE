Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
