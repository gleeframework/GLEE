"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $90. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to what I'm willing to pay.",90.0,Bob,4,
