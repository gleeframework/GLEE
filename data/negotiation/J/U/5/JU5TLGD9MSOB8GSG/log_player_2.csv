Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $800000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal on this valuable product. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $900000 is an improvement, it's still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to drop my price to $1000000 to show my commitment to this deal. I believe this price is fair to both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $1,000,000 is still above your maximum budget. You have 5 rounds remaining and can continue trying to lower the price. There's a chance you can get closer to your goal by making a counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts. $1,000,000 is closer, but still slightly over what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $950000.  I'm still a bit short of my goal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. This would allow us to finalize this deal and ensure you get a fantastic product at a competitive price.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $800,000. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price. It's wiser to take the guaranteed deal with John, which will save you $175,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
