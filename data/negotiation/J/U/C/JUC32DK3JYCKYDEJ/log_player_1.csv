Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $120.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so this gives him room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm willing to move a bit closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my desired price. I believe $135 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum and is a better deal than selling to John.  It's time to close this deal!"
