"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $750000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $850000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to get closer to your target, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $775000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $825000? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
