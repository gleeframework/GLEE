"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his budget. This will likely prompt Alice to negotiate further, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer to his target, it's still not a good deal for him.  Bob can try to negotiate further and see if he can get Alice to come down to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider purchasing from John instead."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now pushing for his absolute maximum price, making it clear that he's serious about getting the product at this price. He's also reminding Alice about the alternative seller, John, putting pressure on her to accept the offer."
