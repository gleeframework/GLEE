"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider purchasing from John instead.",8000.0,Bob,4,
