"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I want to make a profit, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  I will counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $8,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider purchasing from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by continuing to negotiate."
