{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I want to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and while I appreciate his willingness to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower. John is offering a guaranteed $100, which meets my minimum requirement.  I'll take John's offer and move on."
