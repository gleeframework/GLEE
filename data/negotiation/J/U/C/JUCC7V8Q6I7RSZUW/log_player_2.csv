"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Since you're willing to pay $150 for the product from John, accepting Alice's offer at the same price is the best choice. There's no benefit to rejecting Alice's offer and going to John."
