"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the compromise.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,750. I'll make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,250. It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
