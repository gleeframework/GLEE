"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable compromise and a very strong offer for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below John's guaranteed price.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,650,000? This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other interested parties, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now met John's offer.  While there might be a slight chance of getting a little more from Bob, it's risky to continue the negotiation. Accepting the $1,500,000 ensures we get a good price without the risk of Bob walking away."
