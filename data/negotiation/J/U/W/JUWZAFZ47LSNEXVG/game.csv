"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $15,000 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. ",16500.0,Alice,3,
