Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $15,000 is still significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $15,000 as a compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $15,000 and I've already made a counteroffer.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from him, and I'm not willing to risk going through more rounds with the possibility of him rejecting my offer again.  I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
