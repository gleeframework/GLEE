"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $9,000? This would still allow me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
