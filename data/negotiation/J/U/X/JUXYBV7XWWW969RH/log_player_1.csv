"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, but also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject it and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87.50 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50? This way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your suggestion, but $88.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob and I are very close in our price expectations, but still haven't come to an agreement.  I've rejected his counteroffer twice, but I'm concerned that if I reject his offer again, he may not be willing to negotiate further. I value my time and I'm sure there are other buyers out there who are willing to pay my minimum price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
