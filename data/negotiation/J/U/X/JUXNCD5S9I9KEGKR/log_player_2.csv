"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is much higher than your $80 limit and even more than her own valuation.  You can get a much better deal from John."
