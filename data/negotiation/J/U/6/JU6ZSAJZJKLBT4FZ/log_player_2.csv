"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our flagship product. This remarkable item holds significant value to me, but I understand its true worth to you could be even greater. I am offering this exceptional piece to you at a special price, reflecting my confidence in its appeal and your discerning taste.

To make this offer even more compelling, I propose a deal that aligns with both our interests: I am willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial discount from its intrinsic value and ensures a profitable transaction for me while securing a fantastic deal for you.

Please consider this offer carefully. If you are interested in proceeding, let's arrange a time to discuss the details further and finalize the sale. I am confident that together we can create a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice
