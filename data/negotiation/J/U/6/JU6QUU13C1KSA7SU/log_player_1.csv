Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $10,000 is appealing, the product's value is significantly higher.  How about we settle at $13,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product has a high value, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value and my budget constraints. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $12,000 mark I need. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
