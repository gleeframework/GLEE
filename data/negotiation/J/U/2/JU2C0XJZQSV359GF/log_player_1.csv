Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd be very interested in it. My asking price is $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is not too far off from Bob's perceived value, leaving space for him to counter and for us to negotiate.
* **Being friendly and open:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to discuss the price, showing I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response (counteroffer or rejection) and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm also aware of John as a backup option, which gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, given that the product is worth $12,000 to him.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the flexibility to reject Bob's low offer without losing out completely.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise. If negotiations with Bob continue to be unproductive, I'll move to sell to John to secure the guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize why $11,500 is a fair price.
* **Positive Language:** Using language like ""meet in the middle"" encourages Bob to feel like we're working towards a solution together.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  How about we settle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $10,750 is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Further negotiations might be unproductive:** Bob's counteroffers indicate he's unwilling to go much higher, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and ultimately fruitless.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $12,000, which is the minimum I'm comfortable with and aligns with the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

I will inform Bob that I'm accepting John's offer and finalize the transaction. This ensures a profitable outcome without risking further negotiations that might not lead to a satisfactory price."
