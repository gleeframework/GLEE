"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $125. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I still feel that $100 would be a fair price for both of us. Could we possibly meet at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you the product for $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Could we meet at $105?",105.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $110 as a final offer, but I'm not going any lower. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,7,
