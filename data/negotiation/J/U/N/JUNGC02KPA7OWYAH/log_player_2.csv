"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this unique product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident this price reflects the potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You can potentially get a better price by negotiating further. It's worth trying to counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price range."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is certainly a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price allows for a significant gain for you and still ensures a good return for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, it's still a bit too high. You've already made a counteroffer and shown your willingness to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a lower price, potentially closer to $950,000, which you previously offered. There's still room for a compromise that benefits both parties."

Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
