Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows for a deal that is beneficial for both parties. 

Here's why:

* **Starting high:** It's a common strategy in negotiations to start high and then be willing to come down. This sets a strong expectation and gives you more room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room:** $1,400,000 is a good starting point because it's below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but still above Bob's perceived value.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** By offering a price above Bob's value, you increase the likelihood that he will make a counteroffer. This allows you to potentially get a better deal than if you had initially offered a lower price.

Of course, the success of this strategy depends on Bob's willingness to negotiate and his financial resources. But it is a reasonable starting point given the information provided."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair for the product. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than his offer. This allows for a potential deal to be struck that is beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair for the product.  Considering that John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm choosing to sell to him. It's not ideal, but it guarantees me the best possible outcome for the product given the current situation."
