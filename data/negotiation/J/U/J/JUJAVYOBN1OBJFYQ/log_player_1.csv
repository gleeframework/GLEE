{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** You're asking for $140, which is more than your minimum of $120. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You're offering a price lower than the product's worth to Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Is a reasonable first offer:** It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more amicable negotiation. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below our desired price. We can leverage the fact that Bob values the product higher than our minimum and try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? This way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:**  It ensures you're making more than selling to John.
* **Shows willingness to compromise:** It indicates you're open to negotiation, but not willing to settle for a price that's too low.
* **Is within a reasonable range:**  The $135 offer is a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I've given it some thought and am willing to consider $132 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still below our initial asking price, it's a decent compromise considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and the fact that selling to John only nets us $120.  This offer is a good way to secure a sale and ensure a profit."
