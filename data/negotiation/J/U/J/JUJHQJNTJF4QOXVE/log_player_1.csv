"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135.  It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make this a fair offer for us both."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that the price is a fair compromise.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  A $15 gap leaves me room to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Time Constraint:**  By starting with a relatively high price, I want to see if Bob is truly interested in buying the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer is $120, which is the minimum value he's willing to pay. This is below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.  
* **John's Offer:** While John offers $150, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount by continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a price slightly above Bob's offer in the hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $128. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 128} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer, but I'm not settling for Bob's minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still fair, considering the product's value to me.
* **Building Momentum:**  By making a small counteroffer, I hope to keep the negotiation moving forward and reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
