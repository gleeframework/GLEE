"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15000 is my minimum, I believe it's worth a bit more given its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",17500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?,16000.0,Bob,4,
