Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to pay closer to my maximum value, but $12,000 is still too much. I will reject her offer and continue to negotiate."

I'm making a final offer of $10,000, which is my maximum value for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and Alice's willingness to sell.  If Alice rejects this offer, I will move on to John, who is willing to sell the product for the same price."
