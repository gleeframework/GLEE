Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While he's coming up in his offers, it's still not even close to my minimum. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round, but if not, I'm getting close to just selling to John."

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're getting closer to my minimum acceptable price with Bob, but I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the $1,500,000 from John than to risk not getting a good deal from Bob."
