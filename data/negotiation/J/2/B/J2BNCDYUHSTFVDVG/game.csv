"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, how about $1150000? This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to explore other options. This product is truly valuable, and I'm sure you'll regret missing out on it.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
