"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to compromise again, but I think $98 is a more reasonable price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here.  I really do want to buy this product from you, but $98 is still a bit too much. How about we settle at $95? I'm confident you'll find that a good deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think $99 is the minimum I can accept. What do you think?",99.0,Alice,7,
