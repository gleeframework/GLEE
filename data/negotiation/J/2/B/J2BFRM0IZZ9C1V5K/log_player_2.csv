Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50.  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to compromise again, but I think $98 is a more reasonable price for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to your preferred price, you still have the option to buy from John for a lower amount. You're not under pressure to accept anything higher than your target price. Continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair here.  I really do want to buy this product from you, but $98 is still a bit too much. How about we settle at $95? I'm confident you'll find that a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I think $99 is the minimum I can accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You've reached the point where Alice is unwilling to drop below $99, and you're only willing to pay $80. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as you have a guaranteed way to get the product for your target price."
