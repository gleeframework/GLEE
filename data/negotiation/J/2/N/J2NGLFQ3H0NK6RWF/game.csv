"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you see in the product and the price you're willing to pay.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my end. This offer is closer to my budget and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
