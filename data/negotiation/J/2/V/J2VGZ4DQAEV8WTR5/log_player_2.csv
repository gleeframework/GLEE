"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me, but I'm definitely interested. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It shows I'm serious about buying but also want a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $100 is still too high. We have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

We're splitting the difference again with this counteroffer. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer and closer to her value."
