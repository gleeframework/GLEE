Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm also aware that he could reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,200. This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my initial asking price. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll sell the product to John to avoid losing more time and potentially getting a lower price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  To avoid the risk of getting a lower price in the remaining rounds, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  This guarantees I receive my minimum and allows me to move on."
