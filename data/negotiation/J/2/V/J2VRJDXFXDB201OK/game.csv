"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,012,500? This would give us both a decent outcome.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
