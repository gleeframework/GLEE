"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've priced at $16,000, but considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair price that reflects its worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",15500.0,Alice,1,
