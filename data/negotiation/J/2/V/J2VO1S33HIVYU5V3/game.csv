"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
