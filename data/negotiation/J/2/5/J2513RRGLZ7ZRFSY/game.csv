"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant profit. I'm willing to offer you a fair price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a competitive price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that still allows me to make a significant profit, while also being reasonable for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,180,000. This is as close to my minimum price as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to offer $1,125,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and is a fair price for both of us to make a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution that's mutually beneficial.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000 is too low for me, I'll meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and $1,200,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,162,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
