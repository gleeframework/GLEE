""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm thinking something closer to  $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below the product's market value and potential. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this quality and potential return on investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're finding some common ground. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $1,750,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.
