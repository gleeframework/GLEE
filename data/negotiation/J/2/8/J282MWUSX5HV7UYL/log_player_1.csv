"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, but still leaves me with a profit well above my minimum.  I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly without risking too many rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is essentially a compromise between our last two offers. I'm hoping that with only five rounds left, Bob will see that this is a reasonable price and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting risky. Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum, but with only four rounds left, I'm concerned that he's not going to budge further. To avoid the possibility of ending up with a very small profit, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not ideal, but it's still a decent outcome."
