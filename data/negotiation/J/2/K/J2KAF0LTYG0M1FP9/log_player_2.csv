Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute top price.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $820000, which is just $20000 above your top price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I know you place on the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you've made progress in the negotiation, you're getting close to the end of the rounds.  You have two choices:

* **Continue negotiating:**  You can continue negotiating with Alice, but there's a risk that you won't be able to reach an agreement within your budget and you'll end up with nothing.
* **Buy from John:**  You have a guaranteed deal with John at your desired price of $800,000.  This is a safer option since it guarantees you get the product within your budget.

Given the limited rounds remaining and the possibility of not reaching an agreement with Alice, the best decision is to buy the product from John."
