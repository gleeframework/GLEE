"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $750000 for it, reflecting its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000, which I believe is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is my absolute top price.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to move forward with the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $820000, which is just $20000 above your top price. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I know you place on the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",820000.0,Alice,5,
