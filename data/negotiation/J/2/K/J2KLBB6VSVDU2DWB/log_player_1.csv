"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a good starting point.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I want to sell the product, $12,000 is too low. I'm willing to risk going another round with Bob to see if I can get a better price.  John's offer of $15,000 is always a fallback option, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $16,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and make Bob more likely to accept. If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John. Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low. While I could keep trying, I've already been through several rounds and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge much further. John's offer of $15,000 is a much better deal for me, and it guarantees a sale. It's time to move on."
