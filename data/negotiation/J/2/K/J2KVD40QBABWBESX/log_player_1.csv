{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  Let's see what his response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to sell for that price yet.  I'm going to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price to Bob, but I'm still holding out for a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be.  I'm going to counter again, hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price point.  If he rejects again, then I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is only $1,000 above Bob's last offer, and I feel it's a fair compromise.  Hopefully, he'll see this as a good deal and accept it.  If not, I might have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further.  This last offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm not sure it's worth another round of negotiation.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John.  It's not ideal, but it's still a decent outcome."
