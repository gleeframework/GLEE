"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, my budget is a bit tighter.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product offers.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. I can offer you a small concession, but I need to get at least $11,500. This is my final counteroffer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
