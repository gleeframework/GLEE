"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
