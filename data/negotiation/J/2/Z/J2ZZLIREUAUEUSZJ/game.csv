"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that we're still far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, I need to be closer to my desired price point.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",1325000.0,Bob,6,
