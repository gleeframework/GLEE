"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm above Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away the product too cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's a better deal than selling to John, and I'm confident that I can make a decent profit. I'm going to accept his offer."
