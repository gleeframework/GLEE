I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good compromise:

* **It's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80.**  I'm making a profit.
* **It's less than the product's value to Bob ($120).** He still gets a good deal and is likely to accept.

If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $80, so there's no risk in offering this price."
