,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $137.50?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $137.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $120. It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $120. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
