"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer you $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to $1,600,000.  Let's aim for a compromise that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,600,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'm prepared to offer $1,550,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
