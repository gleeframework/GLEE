Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives us room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can always come down a bit.  It's important to remember that John is willing to pay $10,000, so I don't want to go too low too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal of $10,000 with some more negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept, but I'm still within the range of what I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $10,000, $9,500 is a good compromise. It's within my minimum acceptable price and it avoids the risk of losing the sale to Bob entirely.  Plus, it's  better than selling to John for $10,000, as this would mean I'm getting $500 more!"
