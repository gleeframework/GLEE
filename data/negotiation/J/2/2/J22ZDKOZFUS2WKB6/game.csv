"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112.50.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can finalize a deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $109. Can you meet me at that price?",109.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $109 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to drop my price to $111. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best offer we can both agree on.",111.0,Alice,7,
