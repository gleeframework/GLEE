I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and we're close to a deal.  Accepting his offer of $8,500 is a good outcome, given that I could sell to John for $8,000."
