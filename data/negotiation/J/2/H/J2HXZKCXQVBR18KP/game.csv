"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and I'm not sure I can stretch to $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your offer. However, $7,000 significantly undervalues its true worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  Would you consider $9,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I still think $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,250 is closer, but it's still a bit low for what I can accept.  How about we meet right in the middle at $8,625? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",8625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but I don't think I can stretch to $8,625. Can we meet somewhere in between, like $8,375?",8375.0,Bob,6,
