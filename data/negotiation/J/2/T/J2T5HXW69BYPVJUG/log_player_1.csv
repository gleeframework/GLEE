Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""given its value and potential"" and ""fair price that reflects its true worth"" are used to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone is polite and ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially negotiate. 

By starting high, I leave room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
