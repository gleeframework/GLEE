"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. I believe this deal is mutually beneficial, as it's below my minimum selling price but still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
