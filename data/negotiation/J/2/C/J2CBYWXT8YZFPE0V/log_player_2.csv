Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. I'm interested, but it needs to be significantly lower to make sense. How about $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can consider. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this - to show I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'll come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, she's still significantly above your maximum budget and has declared this her ""final offer.""  It's unlikely she'll move much further.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, ensuring you stay within your limit."
