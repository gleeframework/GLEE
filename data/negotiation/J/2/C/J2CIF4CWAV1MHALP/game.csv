"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value your interest, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's quality and potential.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $13,500? I feel that's a fair offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly above $13,500.  Would you be willing to consider $15,500?  This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
