"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the positive aspects of the deal and encourages Bob to consider it seriously. 
* **First Round:** It's important to start strong and demonstrate my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about we bring it down significantly, say to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, his willingness to negotiate is encouraging. I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting his offer and continuing the negotiation.
* **Exploring Options:** I still have 8 rounds to close the deal. Rejecting this offer allows me to explore more advantageous options and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is far too low for me, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and it's a good starting point for further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer within Range:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Compromise and Justification:**  I frame the offer as a ""split the difference"" solution, making it seem like a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Positive and Open Tone:**  I maintain a positive and open tone, showing Bob that I'm still interested in making a deal. 
* **Focus on Value:** I subtly highlight the value of the product by mentioning ""fair profit,"" reinforcing its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's try this - how about $850,000? It's a substantial increase from my previous offer and moves us closer to a realistic price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Despite the lack of progress, Bob is still engaging in the negotiation. This indicates that he's genuinely interested in the product and there's potential for a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Time Remains:** With 6 rounds left, I have enough time to continue negotiating and explore alternative options. Rejecting this offer allows me to hold firm on my position and try to reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **Exploring John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not yet ready to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. I believe there's still room for a better outcome through further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's aim for a more realistic figure that acknowledges both our needs. How about $1,100,000?  This price is closer to my initial offer and reflects the substantial benefits this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** While I'm open to finding a middle ground, I'm not willing to drastically lower my price.  $1,100,000 is a compromise, but it still keeps me significantly above Bob's latest offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by emphasizing its ""substantial benefits."" This reinforces its worth and justifies the price I'm asking for.
* **Moderate Compromise:** This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the farm. It's a moderate compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing that I want to find a solution that works for both of us. This keeps the conversation open and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further, but I need you to meet me closer to my range. How about $925,000? This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and demonstrates my strong interest in acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $925,000 is still a significant loss for me.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.
* **Negotiation Time:** We have 4 rounds remaining. I can continue to negotiate with Bob and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with a few more rounds.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is attractive, I'm still optimistic about getting a better price from Bob. I'm willing to risk losing a few rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate for a deal. This could encourage him to make a more substantial offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is getting closer, but we're still not there yet. Let's meet in the middle at $1,012,500. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to make progress. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's latest offer ($925,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect of the offer, making it seem like a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm offering a compromise, I'm not completely caving in to Bob's demands. I'm still pushing for a higher price, indicating that I'm not desperate to make a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone, encouraging Bob to consider my offer and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, we need to be realistic about where our prices are at. I'm willing to offer a final price of $950,000. This is a very strong offer considering my alternative option. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are in round 8, with only two rounds left. I need to make a decisive decision.
* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's a significant gap between our desired prices.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.  This is a safe and secure option.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  The negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to go much higher, and I'm unwilling to accept such a low price. 

**Conclusion:**  Given the limited time remaining, the risk of further negotiation, and the availability of a secure alternative with John, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
