{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it's not unreasonable given your minimum value.  It leaves room for negotiation, but still gives you a good starting point.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $8000 for it. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $8,000, it's significantly less than your minimum value of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $14,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not able to meet at $14000. Could you consider $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value.  You can likely squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the negotiation alive and gives you a better chance at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? This gives you a great deal on a fantastic product, and it allows me to achieve my minimum goal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10500 for the product. Is this within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below your desired value. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's getting close to your minimum.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you a higher profit, and avoids further negotiation with Bob.  It's a safer and more secure option."
