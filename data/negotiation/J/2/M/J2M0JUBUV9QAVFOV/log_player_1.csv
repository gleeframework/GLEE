Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is significantly more than your minimum of $10,000. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he has room to negotiate a price that's still beneficial to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately pushing Bob to consider the alternative buyer (John). 

By starting with a high offer, you set the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your desired profit margin:** While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit. 
* **There's room for further negotiation:**  There's a gap of $1,500 between Bob's offer and your desired price. This suggests there's room to negotiate a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain the possibility of reaching a more favorable deal while demonstrating that you're not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. 
* **Maintain leverage:** It's still above your minimum desired price and allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Signal flexibility:** By offering a counteroffer instead of immediately rejecting Bob's offer, you signal flexibility and willingness to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to desired price:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 below your initial offer and is significantly closer to your desired profit margin.
* **Risk of losing deal:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  If you reject Bob's offer, you might be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price, losing out on potential profits.

It's in your best interest to accept Bob's offer, as it offers a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
