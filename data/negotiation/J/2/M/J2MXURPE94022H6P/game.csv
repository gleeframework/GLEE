"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,000.  Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too far off for me. How about we settle on $8,900? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value for the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
