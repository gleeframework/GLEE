Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could increase your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a deal while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good price. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and highlights the offer without being overly pushy.

It's important to remember that Bob might reject this offer. However, it represents a calculated risk to potentially earn more than your guaranteed sale."
