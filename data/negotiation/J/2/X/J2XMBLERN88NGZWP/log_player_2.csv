# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to our previous offer of $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $970,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider. If we can agree on this price, I'm willing to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $970,000 is very close to Bob's ideal price.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and continuing to negotiate might result in a deal falling through.  Accepting the offer saves Bob from potentially losing the deal and having to buy the product from John for a higher price.  This also prevents further negotiation rounds, which could be time-consuming."
