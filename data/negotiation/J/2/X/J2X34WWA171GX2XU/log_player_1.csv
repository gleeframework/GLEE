"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not immediately undercutting myself.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I mention the product being ""great"" and ""valuable,"" subtly emphasizing its worth without revealing my true minimum. 

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my starting price and even below my minimum.  While I want to sell, I'm not willing to give away the product for so much less than its value to me.  

By rejecting the offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:**  It shows Bob I'm not desperate and that I value the product. 
* **Gather Information:**  His counteroffer gives me an idea of his perceived value and how much room there is for negotiation.
* **Set the Stage for Counter-Negotiation:**  I can now make a counteroffer that is more in line with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my original asking price. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, subtly implying that he's getting a bargain.
* **Setting the Stage:** This counteroffer sets a more realistic range for the negotiation, hopefully leading to a deal that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm using phrases like ""willing to come down"" to emphasize that I'm making an effort to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum.  While it's still less than I'd ideally like, I've already rejected his previous offer and we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  

Accepting his offer gives me these advantages:

* **Closing the Deal:** It secures a sale and avoids the risk of further rejection.
* **Meeting Minimum:** It meets my minimum requirement of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Time Efficiency:** It avoids further rounds of negotiation, saving time and effort.

While I could try for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and the pressure of the approaching deadline make this offer a reasonable compromise."
