"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value, I propose a price of $95 for it. This is a fair offer considering its worth to you and my cost. I look forward to your response.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, $95 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm happy to pay $85 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me and your own cost.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. I'm willing to pay $88 for the product, which is still above your cost and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
