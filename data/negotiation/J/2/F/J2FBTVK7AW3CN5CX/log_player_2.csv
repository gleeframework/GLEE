"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before going with John.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in your product, but $9,500 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000?  This still allows me to get a fair price for my product, and it's within your budget. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. There's a chance you can negotiate further with Alice, and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000.  How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,750 is closer to my goal, I still need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  $8,875.  This is a fair price that will hopefully work for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still above what you're willing to pay.  It's likely that the negotiation will continue, but there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees you the best possible price within your budget."
