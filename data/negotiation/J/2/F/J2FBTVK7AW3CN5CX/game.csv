"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in your product, but $9,500 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000?  This still allows me to get a fair price for my product, and it's within your budget. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000.  How about $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $8,750 is closer to my goal, I still need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  $8,875.  This is a fair price that will hopefully work for both of us.  What do you think?",8875.0,Alice,5,
