"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

Rationale:

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a substantial discount.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and expresses interest, but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** We're aiming for a price well below our $80 limit, hoping to secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $85 is still above our ideal price, and we're only a few rounds in. Let's see if we can nudge her closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

Rationale:

* **Meeting Halfway:** We're suggesting a price that splits the difference between her counteroffer ($85) and our previous offer ($65). This shows willingness to negotiate while moving closer to our target.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Using phrases like ""meet you halfway"" and ""fair compromise"" can make the offer seem more appealing and reasonable to Alice.
* **Still Below Limit:** We're still aiming for a price below our $80 maximum, leaving room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as we won't get a better price.  We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
