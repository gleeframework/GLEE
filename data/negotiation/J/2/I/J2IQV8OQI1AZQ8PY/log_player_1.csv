"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Price:**  I'm opening with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. This helps him understand the rationale behind the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if he finds the price too high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Bob's response will heavily influence my next move. If he rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm focusing on Bob, John's offer of $800,000 is a safety net.  If negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive, I can always accept John's offer to secure at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is at my minimum value. While it's tempting to accept, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Rejecting allows me to explore potential counteroffers from Bob, hoping to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe the value of this product warrants a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'd be willing to go up to $850000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer remains at $850,000, and my counteroffers haven't persuaded him to go higher.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob increases.
* **John's Offer:**  While I'd prefer to earn more, John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed safety net.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing out to both Bob and John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit.  It's a strategic move to avoid further risk and secure a reasonable outcome."
