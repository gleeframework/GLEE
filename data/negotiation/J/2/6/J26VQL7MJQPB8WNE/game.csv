"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $13000 is slightly above what I am comfortable spending. I would like to propose a purchase price of $12500. I believe this strikes a good balance between the value you're offering and my budget constraints.",12500.0,Bob,4,
