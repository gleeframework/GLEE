"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, it's not the best possible price. He'll try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason:  While $105 is closer to Bob's desired price, he still wants to try to get a lower price. He's still within his budget, so he's not in a rush to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $100?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Bob has already made a counteroffer of $100, and Alice has countered with $102.50. While he would ideally get a lower price, $102.50 is still within his budget and a better deal than buying from John for $120.  It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly better price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice."
