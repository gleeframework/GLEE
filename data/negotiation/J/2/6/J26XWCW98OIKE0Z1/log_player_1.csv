I'm going to start high, aiming for a price that's still within a reasonable range for Bob while ensuring I get as close to my desired value as possible.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000,  there's room for negotiation. This initial offer provides a starting point and allows me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffers."
