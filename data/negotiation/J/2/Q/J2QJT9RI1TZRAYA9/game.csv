"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we aim for $16,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a price I'm comfortable with.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $14,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000, which would be $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",15000.0,Alice,5,
