Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This allows her to start with a significantly higher offer. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even without going into specifics.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This offer assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice has reason to believe Bob is very price-sensitive, she might need to adjust her strategy.
* **Negotiation Room:** This offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can decide if she wants to accept, further negotiate, or move on to John."
