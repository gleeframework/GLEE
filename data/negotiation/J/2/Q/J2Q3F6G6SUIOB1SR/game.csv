"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive,  that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,050,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
