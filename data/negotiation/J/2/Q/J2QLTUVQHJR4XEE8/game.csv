"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $130. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's quality and features.",130.0,Alice,5,
