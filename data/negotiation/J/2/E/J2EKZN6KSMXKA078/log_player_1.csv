"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for room for negotiation and sets the bar high. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so this offer is a calculated risk. I believe the potential for a higher profit outweighs the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he already demonstrated a willingness to pay more than my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my initial asking price. This move signals a willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,200 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. It's a strong profit, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to close this deal."
