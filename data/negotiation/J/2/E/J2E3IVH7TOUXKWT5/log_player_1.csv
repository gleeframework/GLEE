Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $8,500, which is slightly above the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've made a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on how close it is to my target price and how likely it is that I can get a better deal from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No risk of a lower offer:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer in the next round, and I risk wasting time and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob. 
* **John's offer is equal:**  John is willing to pay the same amount. There's no advantage to selling to John at this point. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice, as it ensures I get my minimum price and avoids potential risks."
