Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's estimated value, but high enough that you're still getting a good price for your product.  

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **High starting point:**  By starting high, I show Bob that I value the product and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:**  There's still room for me to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **Back-up plan:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000 if I feel like I'm not getting a good price from Bob.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** for now.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price. 

Here's why:

* **Bob's motivation:**  Bob clearly wants the product, as his counteroffer is significantly higher than John's. 
* **Room for negotiation:** We are still $300,000 apart, so there's room for a compromise. 

I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if I can convince Bob to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000? It's a fair price that still allows both of us to come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Here's why I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,100,000).
* **Staying above my minimum:** This price is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** and sell the product for $1,200,000. 

Here's why:

* **Good deal:** This price is still much higher than what I could get from John. 
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting this offer keeps the door open for future deals with Bob in the future.

Even though I could potentially push for a higher price, accepting this offer feels like a good compromise and a positive outcome."
