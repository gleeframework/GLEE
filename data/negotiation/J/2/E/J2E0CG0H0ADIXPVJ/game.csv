"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, which is a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",8000.0,Alice,5,
