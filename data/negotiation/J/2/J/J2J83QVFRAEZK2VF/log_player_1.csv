"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price in the first round. 
* If Bob rejects, I have room to lower the price slightly in subsequent rounds while still achieving a profit greater than my minimum. 
* I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* I have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.
* There are still 8 rounds remaining, which gives me ample opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.
* Selling to John now would result in a lower profit compared to what I could potentially achieve by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but only by $100,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. 
* This counteroffer is still considerably higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but not give away too much.
* I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* I'm keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the option to sell to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired outcome.
*  I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me ample time to potentially secure a better price. 
* Selling to John now would result in a lower profit compared to what I could potentially achieve by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1280000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount ($20,000). This demonstrates flexibility while showing that I am still committed to reaching a deal with Bob. 
* This offer is close to Bob's previous offer, signaling that I'm ready to compromise. 
* With 5 rounds left, I want to make a counteroffer that will encourage Bob to accept, but also gives me some leeway for further negotiation if necessary.
*  I am still keeping in mind the option to sell to John, but I believe I can get a better price with Bob."
