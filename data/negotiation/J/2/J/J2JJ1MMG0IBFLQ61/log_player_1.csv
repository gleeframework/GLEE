Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. He might value the ""exclusivity"" you're presenting.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without overthinking.

**Important Note:**  While this offer aims to maximize your potential profit, there's always a chance Bob will reject it. If he does, you still have your guaranteed sale to John at your minimum acceptable price."
