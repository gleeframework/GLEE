Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I think it's worth $150, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You have insider information that the product is worth $150 to Bob. This is a huge advantage in the negotiation.
* **Aiming High but Staying Reasonable:**  Starting with a price of $120 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. It's a price that's beneficial for both parties if Bob accepts.
* **Backup Plan:**  You're not desperate. Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about your backup plan."
