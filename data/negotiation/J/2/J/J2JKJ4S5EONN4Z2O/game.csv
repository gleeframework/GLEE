I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's more than your value for the product.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,800.
