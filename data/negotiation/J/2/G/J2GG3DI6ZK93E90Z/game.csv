"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product.  It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price considering its value and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000? I believe this is a fair price, reflecting the value of the product and our desire to reach an agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
