"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price still allows me some profit and ensures a great deal for you. Let's work together to make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. While I can't go down to $950,000, I'm willing to go a bit further.  Let's meet at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price that allows me to recover some of my costs and gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
