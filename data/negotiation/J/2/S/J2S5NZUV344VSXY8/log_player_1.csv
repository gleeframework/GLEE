Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see how much value Bob places on the product.  If he rejects this, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and consider my options:

* **Lower my price:**  If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower, I might consider lowering my price but not below my minimum value of $800,000.
* **Stay firm:** If Bob's counteroffer is close to my initial offer or doesn't seem reasonable, I might stay firm and see if he's willing to increase his offer. 
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations stall, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiations. It's better to secure the deal now and avoid the potential of a protracted negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even a failed sale."
