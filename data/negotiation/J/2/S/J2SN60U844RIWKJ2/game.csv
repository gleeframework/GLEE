"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $750,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high.  Would you be willing to consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $725,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm willing to go a bit further to reach an agreement.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  $725,000 is close, but to make this work for me I'd need to be at $710,000.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $720,000, which is a bit above your offer, but still a discount from my initial price. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close the deal.",720000.0,Alice,7,
