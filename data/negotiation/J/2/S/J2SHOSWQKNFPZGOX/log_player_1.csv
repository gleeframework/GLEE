"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This should encourage Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, and I have rounds left. I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's try to work something out!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,500 which is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  This might be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price and I'm getting closer to the middle ground.  With only 6 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even selling to John at a lower price."
