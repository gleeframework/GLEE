"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's try to work something out!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
