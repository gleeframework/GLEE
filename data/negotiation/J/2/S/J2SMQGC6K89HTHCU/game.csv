"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay a maximum of $15000 for the product. Please let me know if this offer is acceptable.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still feel that $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I would like to stick to my original offer of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $18000 is still a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $17500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and what you're willing to pay.",17500.0,Alice,5,
