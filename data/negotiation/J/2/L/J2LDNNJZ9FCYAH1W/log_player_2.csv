"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $9,000 is less than $10,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** You value the product at $10,000, so getting it for $9,000 is a saving of $1,000."
