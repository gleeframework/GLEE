"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7000? I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway. Would you be willing to consider 8200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $7500?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair considering the value it offers.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 7500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of going down to 8000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the price I originally had in mind, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Would you be willing to meet me at 8000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
