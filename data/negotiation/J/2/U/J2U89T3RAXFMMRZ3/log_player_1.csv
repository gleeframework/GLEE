Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, so I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Bob's Value:** I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob.  I need to offer a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for me.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in negotiations. This means I can be a bit more aggressive with my initial offer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target. However, if the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have John as a backup buyer, which allows me to hold out for a better price.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially secure a more profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my position and allows for further negotiation. This keeps the possibility of a higher price alive while also allowing me to assess if the negotiation is worth continuing or if it's better to secure the $15,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and could potentially lead to a quicker agreement.
* **Still Profitable:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum value of $15,000 and closer to my target price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much. This maintains my negotiation leverage and allows me to potentially push for a higher price if Bob rejects again.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while maintaining my desired profit margin.  It's a strategic move that demonstrates flexibility but also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $9000.  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  We've reached an impasse. Bob is firm on $9,000, and I'm unwilling to go below $11,000.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, which is significantly better than Bob's final offer.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste time and energy, and there's no guarantee of reaching a better price.

**Strategy:**

It's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure my desired profit. While negotiating with Bob may have yielded a slightly better price, the risk of continued negotiation and the potential for a lower price outweigh the potential rewards. Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
