Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice. However, $950000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000. Can you meet me in the middle at $900000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $925,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $925000, which would be $887500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $887,500 doesn't quite reflect the full value of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $912,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $912500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and reflects the product's value to Bob. Accepting this offer is the most advantageous decision at this point."
