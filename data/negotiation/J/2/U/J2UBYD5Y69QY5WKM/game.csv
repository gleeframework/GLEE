,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice. However, $950000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000. Can you meet me in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $925000. This price is still fair and reflects the product's potential. Let's aim for a quick resolution.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $925000, which would be $887500. Can you consider this price?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $887500 doesn't quite reflect the full value of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $912500. This price acknowledges your budget while also allowing me to get closer to my desired value. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $912500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,6,
