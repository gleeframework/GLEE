{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it!  I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but not too high. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good deal, while also showing that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to try and get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for this product."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
 
I'm proposing $105 as a compromise.  It's still above my minimum value of $100, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$95 is just below my minimum value of $100, but it's still a decent deal considering Bob's initial offer of $90. It's better to accept this offer than risk further negotiation or selling to John for $100."
