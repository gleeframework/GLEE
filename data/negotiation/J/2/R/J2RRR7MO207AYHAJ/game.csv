"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $7500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? This would still allow me to make a decent profit and I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8250?",8250.0,Bob,4,
