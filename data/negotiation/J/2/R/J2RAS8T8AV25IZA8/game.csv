"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I believe this price is more reasonable and would be a good compromise for both of us.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $17,500 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $19,000.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and will exceed your expectations. I'm confident this is a fair offer.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product is top-of-the-line, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",18000.0,Bob,6,
