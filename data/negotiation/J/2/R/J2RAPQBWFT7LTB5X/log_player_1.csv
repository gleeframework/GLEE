Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I've started high, the slightly discounted price might entice Bob, and there's a chance he might counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob declines, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest potential profit while ensuring I don't lose money."
