"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth a lot more to you than that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, as it might encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, fostering a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I can still try to get closer to my ideal price of $14,000. 
* **Potential for counter-negotiation:** I believe I can still influence Bob to raise his offer. There are still 8 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity for negotiation. 
* **Keeping options open:** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm aiming for a better deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is significantly below what this product is worth to you. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach a compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain by agreeing to a slightly higher price.
* **Creating urgency:** The phrase ""Let's see if we can close this deal"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit below my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to push for a better deal:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room to negotiate. I want to see if I can convince Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still a safety net:**  While I'm not eager to sell to John, it's a viable option if negotiations with Bob continue to fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,500 is simply not feasible for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm maintaining my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 while offering a small compromise to show flexibility.
* **Emphasizing value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Creating a sense of finality:**  The phrase ""Let's make this happen"" subtly implies that this might be my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, there is limited time to negotiate.
* **Risk of further decline:**  Bob's offers have been consistently decreasing. Continuing to negotiate might result in an even lower offer, making it difficult to reach a profitable agreement.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:**  John offers my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a guaranteed profit and preventing potential losses from further negotiations with Bob.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, the risk of a bad deal with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
