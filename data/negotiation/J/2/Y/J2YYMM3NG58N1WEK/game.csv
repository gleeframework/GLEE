"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $13,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to make one last concession, but $12,500 is still a little too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.  What do you say?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but no higher. I really want this product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you meet me at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
