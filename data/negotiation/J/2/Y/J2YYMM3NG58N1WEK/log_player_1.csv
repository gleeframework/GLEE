{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a little lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a sense that I'm open to a deal but also shows him the value of the product.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and open in my communication. I highlight the benefits for Bob and try to build a positive relationship.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic first offer. By starting a little lower than my minimum, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still securing a good price. I'm also keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way.  This gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  It's also below the $12,000 value to Bob.  Selling to John for $15,000 is still the best option at this point.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $13,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $13,000, which is a significant move from my previous offer but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while also reaffirming the value of the product. The message is polite but firm, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate but not budge too much further.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility without completely giving in.  It leaves space for a potential deal while still putting pressure on Bob to increase his offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to either sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,500. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still slightly below it. I'm still holding out for a better price. It's worth making one more counteroffer to see if I can push him higher, and if not, I can then sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to make one last concession, but $12,500 is still a little too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  This offer is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showcasing my flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's efforts and frame the offer as a compromise that benefits both parties. I highlight the fairness of the price and the potential for a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

This is a final attempt to negotiate with Bob before going to John. It shows a willingness to compromise without settling for a price I'm not comfortable with.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will move forward with selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, but no higher. I really want this product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. Can you meet me at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been firm on his $12,500 offer, and while it's tempting to take that price, it's still slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. John is offering a significantly better deal.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum requirements."
