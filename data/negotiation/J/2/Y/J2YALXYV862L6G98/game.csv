"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? That's still a great price for the value you'll get.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $16,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
