Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is too far below my minimum value for the product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $16,000? That's still a great price for the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $16,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $14,000 is still a good deal for me, especially considering that I could potentially get $15,000 from John. It's better to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and John."
