"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $775,000.  What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $775,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I'll add a small premium to it. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering it's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
