Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175** is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **The message** is friendly and attempts to build a rapport with Bob while highlighting the perceived value of the product. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a strong initial offer, hoping to entice Bob to accept or at least come close to the desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I would like to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter-offer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal. $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a good price for this great product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum of $150 but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my understanding of Bob's budget and emphasizing the value of the product to incentivize him to accept.  

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still remaining profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $130 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get a bit more than $130 for the product, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob and the risk of him walking away altogether, I've decided to sell the product to John for $150. This ensures a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
