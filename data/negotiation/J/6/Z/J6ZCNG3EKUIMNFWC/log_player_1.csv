Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great price for a product you value at $100, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
