"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While I value your business, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value this product brings. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $950,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $920,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on the value I'm offering. How about we split the difference and settle on $935,000? This price is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product's performance.",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $920,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $930,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",930000.0,Bob,6,
