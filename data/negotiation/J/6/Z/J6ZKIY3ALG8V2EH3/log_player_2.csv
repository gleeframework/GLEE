"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good starting point to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this product. However, $12,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm open to negotiation, but this is the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price. Given that we are already in round 5 and I've had limited success in negotiating a lower price, it's likely that Alice will not go lower than $9,500. I've already indicated my willingness to pay a maximum of $8,500. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
