"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in your product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a good return on your investment.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value I place on this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise and a good step towards reaching an agreement. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
