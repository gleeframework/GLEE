Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $145 is above your minimum of $120, so you're making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $145 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's space for Bob to counter-offer without you feeling pressured to drop to your minimum immediately."
