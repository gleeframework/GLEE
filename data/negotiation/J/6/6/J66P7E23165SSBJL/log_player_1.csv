Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he should be willing to pay at least $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice.  

Here's why:

* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a counteroffer, and the price could keep dropping, potentially leading to a sale below my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I reject Bob's offer and fail to reach a deal, I can still sell to John for $8,000.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob or losing out on the opportunity altogether."
