I've reached a point where I don't believe I can get a better price from Bob.  He's unwilling to budge much further, and I've already made several concessions.  To avoid risking further negotiation and a potentially lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This is a good outcome for me, and I'm happy with this deal."
