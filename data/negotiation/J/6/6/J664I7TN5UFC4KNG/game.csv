"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I still want the product, I can't quite stretch my budget to $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $11,750. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",11750.0,Alice,5,
