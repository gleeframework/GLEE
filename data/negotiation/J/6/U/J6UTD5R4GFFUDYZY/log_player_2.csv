"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100.  It's a great deal for something worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $100. This means you're only saving $20, and you can potentially do better.
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you the opportunity to make counteroffers and try to lower the price further.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always purchase the product from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm only willing to pay $90 for this product right now. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  How about $95?  That's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your desired price, you're still saving less than $25, and you can potentially get a better deal.
* **You have 7 rounds left.** You still have time to continue negotiating and try to lower the price even further.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** You can always buy the product from John for $120 if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
