"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Building a Relationship:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will receive, fostering a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Buffer:** I'm leaving a $50,000 buffer to potentially adjust the price if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000,  so I have a solid fallback option if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation to get closer to my target price of $1,450,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still represents a significant value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value Bob will receive at this price, reminding him of the benefit he'll get.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, aiming to maintain a collaborative negotiation.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1320000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:**  Bob's offer of $1,320,000 is only $30,000 below my previous counteroffer of $1,350,000.  This is a very small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation would not yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Time is Money:**  We've already had three rounds of negotiation, and time is of the essence. 
* **Meeting John's Offer:**  While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer is still above John's offer of $1,200,000, making it a more favorable option at this point. 
* **Avoiding Further Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further rounds of negotiation and potentially a lower price, or a complete breakdown in negotiations."
