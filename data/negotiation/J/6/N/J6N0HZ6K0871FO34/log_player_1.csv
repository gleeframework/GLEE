Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value *to you*, the message hints at it (""Given its value..."") to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals to Bob that you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
