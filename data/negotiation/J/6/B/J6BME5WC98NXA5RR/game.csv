,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we meet at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
