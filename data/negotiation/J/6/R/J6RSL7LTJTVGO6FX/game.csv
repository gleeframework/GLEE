"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $725,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the end of our negotiation rounds. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",700000.0,Alice,7,
