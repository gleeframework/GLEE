Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **Motivating Language:** My message emphasizes the benefit for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price is above Bob's value, so there's potential for him to counter-offer, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Having a Backup Plan:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a compromise closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position, as I can walk away from the deal with Bob if necessary.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's a good price point considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer closer to my value:**  $9,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This allows for a potential compromise.
* **Motivating language:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate and suggesting a good price point for both of us.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  This offer is still above Bob's value, so there's potential for him to counter-offer again, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Remembering John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to stand firm if Bob rejects my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $7,500 is far below my minimum value of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  By selling to John, I secure a sale at my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks taking up valuable time, potentially costing me the opportunity to sell to other buyers or pursue other opportunities. 

It's more beneficial to take the guaranteed profit from John than to risk further negotiations with Bob."
