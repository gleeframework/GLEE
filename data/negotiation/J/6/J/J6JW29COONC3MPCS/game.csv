"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than my minimum asking price. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, Alice. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $900,000 to $950,000, so how about $925,000? That's a fair compromise for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
