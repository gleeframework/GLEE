"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be very valuable to you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle a bit? Would you consider $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
