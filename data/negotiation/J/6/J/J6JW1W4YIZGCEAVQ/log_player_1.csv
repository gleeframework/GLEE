"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $9,500. I hope this is within the range you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $9,500 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($8,000) and is a reasonable step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. While I could push for a higher price, there's a risk of him walking away.
