Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport.
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the product's value without revealing specifics, making Bob curious.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm open to Bob's counteroffer, but I'm setting the initial bar high. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget while leaving myself room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $12000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's room to negotiate higher with Bob.  He's shown interest, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be my last resort.  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your perspective.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to continue our conversation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I've lowered my price slightly from the initial $15,000 to show flexibility, but I'm still above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that my counteroffer is ""fair,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially encouraging a compromise.
* **Maintain Interest:** I'm keeping the conversation going to explore if Bob's willing to meet me halfway. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while ensuring I don't sell below my minimum threshold."
