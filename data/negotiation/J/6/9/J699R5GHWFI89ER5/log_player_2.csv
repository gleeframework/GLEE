"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I understand it might be worth more than just monetary compensation. However, considering my costs and the market value, I propose a fair transaction of $12,000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the product's worth to you and the expenses involved in acquiring and preparing it for delivery. I am confident this offer will be mutually beneficial. Should you have any questions or need further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John at a lower cost."
