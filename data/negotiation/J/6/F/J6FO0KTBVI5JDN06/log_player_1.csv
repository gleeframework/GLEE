"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really love. I'm open to offers, but my starting price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the [product name], but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I can likely get more by continuing negotiations. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $90?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's split the difference - how about $85?  That's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $85 is less than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a good deal considering the time spent negotiating. I'll accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
