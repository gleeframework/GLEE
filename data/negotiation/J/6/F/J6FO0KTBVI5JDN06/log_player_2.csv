"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product name] that I think you'd really love. I'm open to offers, but my starting price is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to start by trying to negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, there's room to try to get a better deal.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the [product name], but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $80?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Offering $80 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone, making it less likely Alice will feel pressured or offended.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends by acknowledging a willingness to find a middle ground, suggesting flexibility and open communication."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $90?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly to $90, which is closer to Bob's target price. However, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price and potentially secure a better deal.  There are still multiple rounds available, and Bob doesn't want to rush into accepting a price that might be too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's split the difference - how about $85?  That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  Bob continues to negotiate, showing a willingness to find a compromise while staying within his budget.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering to split the difference between $80 and $90 demonstrates a reasonable and collaborative approach.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the benefits of the deal for both parties, making it more appealing to Alice."
