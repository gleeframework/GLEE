"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering the value it can bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might encourage her to lower the price."
