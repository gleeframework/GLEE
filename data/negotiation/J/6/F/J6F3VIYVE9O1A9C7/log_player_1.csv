"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, hoping to make the deal seem attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to counteroffer if he's not happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a price of $128 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal.** While $128 is above my minimum of $120, it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **Opportunity for a better price:** I believe there's room for a slight increase in price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired amount with a counteroffer. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have nine rounds remaining, so I can afford to be patient and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $128 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get closer to $132 for the sale. Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight increase:** I'm aiming for a middle ground by increasing the price by a smaller amount than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm not making a hard stand on a specific price, but rather demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $130 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $130 is very close to my desired price point of $132, and it's significantly better than the $128 Bob offered previously.
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is a factor:** With only six rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a good deal and don't risk ending up with the lower price from John."
