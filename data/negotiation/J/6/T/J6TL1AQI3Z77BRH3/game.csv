"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $14,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $16,500.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I still think $16,500 is a bit high, I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $15,500 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. My final counteroffer is $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,5,
