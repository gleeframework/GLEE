Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate. I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects this offer, but ultimately I know I can get at least $15,000 from John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I think I can still get a little more.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a fair compromise.  I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, but it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'm happy to accept his offer and move forward."
