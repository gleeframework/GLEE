"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough in the product to make a counteroffer, revealing more about his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I believe there's room for negotiation, especially since Bob has already shown interest by making a counteroffer.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for potential further negotiation. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to accept, as it's closer to his offer than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering and not far from my target price. Accepting this offer ensures a strong profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
