"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000.  This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that might incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, but I'm not willing to sell for $1,150,000 yet.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground.  If we don't, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000.  This is only $50,000 above Bob's last offer, and I believe it's a good compromise.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and agree to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and the offers are getting closer to my minimum. However, I'm not sure I can get a better price than John's offer of $1,200,000.  To avoid risking a stalemate and losing out on a decent profit, I'm going to sell to John."
