"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum requirement. Let's finalize this and make this a win-win situation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's compromise at $900000. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get closer to my desired value and still saving you a considerable sum compared to your initial assessment. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $900000, so I'll offer $875000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
