Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $900000, so I'll offer $875000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

While I'd ideally want more, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise and is significantly better than selling to John. I'm going to accept it to finalize the deal."
