* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm lower bound.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** It's roughly the midpoint between your maximum value ($12,000) and Alice's minimum value ($8,000). This makes it a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a slightly higher price, while still leaving you a decent savings compared to John's offer."

* **Pressure Point:** This is a critical point in the negotiation. With only 2 rounds left, this counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk a potential deal-breaker in the next round.
* **Balancing Risk:** While it's a riskier move than previous rounds, it's also a chance to make a big leap towards your desired price. If she accepts, you've saved a significant amount compared to John's price. 
* **Last Chance:** If Alice rejects, you'll need to weigh whether to make a final, potentially higher, counteroffer in the next round or accept John's offer."

{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** This is your last chance to make a deal with Alice. This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise but also pushing Alice to meet you halfway.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's current price, but it's closer to her desired range. It's a gamble, but it could secure you a good deal. 
* **No Room for Error:** If Alice rejects, you will have to buy from John at $12,000.  This is your last chance to secure a better deal.

**Outcome:** This is a high-risk, high-reward move.  It depends on how motivated Alice is to close the deal. If she's determined to sell at a higher price, you might be forced to buy from John. However, if she sees this as a last chance to make a sale, she might accept."
