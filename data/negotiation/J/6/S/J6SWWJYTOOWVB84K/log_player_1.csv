{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly approach, highlighting the value of the product. It offers a price that is higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob and gives you a good starting point in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still higher than my minimum price of $100. However, it is lower than my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  While $120 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This still gives me a fair return, and I think it's a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum price of $100, it's still a good profit for me. Considering that Bob has been willing to negotiate, I'm confident that this is a fair price and will accept his offer."
