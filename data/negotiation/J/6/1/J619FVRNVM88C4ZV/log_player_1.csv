Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** I want to aim high and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  The offer is not so high that it's immediately unreasonable, allowing for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:** By having John as an alternative buyer, I'm not pressured to accept a low price from Bob. 

I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to rush into accepting it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price:

* **Potential for better outcome:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he values the product highly.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps me in the negotiation and allows me to see if I can improve the price.
* **Avoiding a quick sell:** Accepting immediately might lead to regret if I could have secured a better deal.

**Next steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This price is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product. If he's willing to pay more, it indicates he values it highly.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's initial offer, I retain the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails.

I'll carefully consider Bob's next move and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000. While it's still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his initial offer and a good compromise. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased value:** $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or a lower offer from Bob. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the sale to Bob outweighs the potential gain.

**Conclusion:**

I'm confident that accepting this offer is the best strategy to maximize my profit. I'm securing a price higher than my minimum and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
