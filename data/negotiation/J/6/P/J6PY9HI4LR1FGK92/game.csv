"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. To meet you halfway, I could go down to $13,500. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $11,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
