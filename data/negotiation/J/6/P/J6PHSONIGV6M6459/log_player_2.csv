"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $125 is less than your $150 maximum and a good deal compared to John's $150 price."
