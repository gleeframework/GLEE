Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's attractive to both of us: 

* It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80, allowing me to potentially make a good profit.
* It's lower than the value of $120 to Bob, giving him a potential incentive to accept. 

This strategy allows for negotiation and leaves room to potentially reach a price that benefits us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is still a good outcome. It's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80 and leaves me with a profit.  There's always a chance that continuing negotiations might lead to a higher price, but accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely and ending up with the lower price from John."
