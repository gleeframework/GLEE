Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,450,000? I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. That's my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a tempting offer, we still have room to negotiate. Bob is showing willingness to move upward, and we're getting closer to a price that comfortably exceeds our minimum. I'm confident we can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit under what I'm looking for. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now dropped his offer below his initial statement of $1,300,000 being his ""final offer."" This suggests he's less serious about a true compromise.  It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer. 

It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
