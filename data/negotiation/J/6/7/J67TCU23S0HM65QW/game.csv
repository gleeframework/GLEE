"I'm not budging on the price, Bob. I've already given you a great deal at $98, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're still interested, I'm willing to throw in a free accessory with the purchase, which is a $20 value. That's the best deal I can offer. The product price remains at $98.",98.0,Alice,9,
