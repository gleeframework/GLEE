"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant price reduction and shows my commitment to making this deal work. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to reduce the price, Alice. However, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given our respective positions.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
