"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal for something with such immense value."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening:**  Starting high anchors the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it sets a higher perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""potential"" and that it's ""worth at least $1,500,000"" to Bob,  I'm aiming to create a sense of scarcity and desirability. 
* **Leaving Room:** While I want to maximize profit, the offer is still significantly below Bob's perceived value, providing room for negotiation.

The goal is to gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that asking price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value. Accepting this offer would mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. While selling to John is an option, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value and provides a fair outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've significantly lowered my asking price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential to justify the higher price point. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The new price of $1,200,000 is still well above Bob's offer and allows room for further negotiation while aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. To be frank, I'm working with a budget, and anything above $900,000 will be tough.  How about we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now inching closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $900,000 is still a significant difference. His mention of a budget could be a negotiation tactic, or it could be genuine.  

However, I'm only $100,000 away from my safety net with John.  It's worth risking another round to see if I can bridge the gap closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's make this simple: $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm above $1,000,000 but offering a small concession to entice Bob.
* **Introducing Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that further negotiation is unlikely and prompting a decision from Bob.

This approach aims to either secure a deal close to my target or provide a clean break to sell to John."
