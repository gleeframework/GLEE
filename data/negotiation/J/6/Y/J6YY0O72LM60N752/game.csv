"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. This is a fantastic deal for something with such immense value.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that asking price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value and provides a fair outcome for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. To be frank, I'm working with a budget, and anything above $900,000 will be tough.  How about we meet in the middle at that price?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's make this simple: $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
