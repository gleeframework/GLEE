"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. Let's work together to make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $850,000? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a final offer. If you don't accept it, I'm going to have to sell to John, who's willing to pay my asking price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, which would be $775,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
