"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.  You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000, especially since you're willing to pay up to $800,000 from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm still confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement on this.

While Alice is coming down in price, I'm starting to think that this negotiation might go on for a while, and I'm getting closer to my limit.  John is offering a good price, and I'm comfortable buying from him to avoid further negotiation."
