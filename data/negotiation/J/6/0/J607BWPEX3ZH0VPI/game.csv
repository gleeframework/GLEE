"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $110? That's still a great deal for a product you value at $100.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  That's fair for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair compromise that still gets us both closer to what we want.",110.0,Alice,5,
