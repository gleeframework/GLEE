"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This would still leave you with a significant value, and it's a fair compromise considering the unique nature of this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
