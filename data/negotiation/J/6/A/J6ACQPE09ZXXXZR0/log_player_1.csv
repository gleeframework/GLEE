"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value of the product to pique Bob's curiosity. 
* **Open Ended:**  I avoid making the offer seem like a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, allowing for more conversation.

This is a strategic starting point. I'll adjust my approach based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested, but he's also trying to drive a hard bargain. I can use this as leverage to potentially reach a more favorable price in subsequent rounds.
* **John as Backup:**  While John's offer is a safety net, I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob. I want to explore the negotiation further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This would still leave you with a significant value, and it's a fair compromise considering the unique nature of this product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by offering a price lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:**  $1,200,000 represents a middle ground, increasing the likelihood that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise.

This counteroffer aims to find a point where we can potentially reach an agreement while still ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing Bob altogether, especially with only 6 rounds remaining. 
* **Time Factor:** It's important to consider the time constraint.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a deal quickly and move on to other opportunities.

By accepting this offer, I'm able to achieve my minimum goal while also avoiding potential delays and uncertainties associated with continued negotiations."
