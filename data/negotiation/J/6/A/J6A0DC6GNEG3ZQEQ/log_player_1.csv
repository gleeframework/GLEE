Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm offering it at a special price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $925,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so you don't need to go below that price with Bob.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as a special offer, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
