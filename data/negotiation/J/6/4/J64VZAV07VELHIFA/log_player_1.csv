Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you start with a price significantly higher ($1,450,000) to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price without revealing your minimum.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a single-round negotiation.  A more nuanced approach might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers.
* Bob's risk tolerance is unknown. A very high offer might make him walk away entirely, even if he values the product."
