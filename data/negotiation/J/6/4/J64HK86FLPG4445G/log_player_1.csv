"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming for a good starting point.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message makes Bob feel more comfortable and encourages negotiation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation shows flexibility and increases the chances of a deal. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I know I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is sticking to his perceived value of $100. 
* **My Minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John, so I can't accept Bob's offer yet.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have plenty of rounds left to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'll offer the product for $110.  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering a middle ground price shows willingness to negotiate and makes the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the value for Bob (""great price"") and my need to meet my desired price (""closer to my desired price"") builds a sense of fairness. 
* **Reiterating Value:** Emphasizing the value of the product keeps Bob interested.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have plenty of rounds to continue negotiating if necessary."
