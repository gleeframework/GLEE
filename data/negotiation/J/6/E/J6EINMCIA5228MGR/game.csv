"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a little, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $110 for it. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close the deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $112. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can meet in the middle.",112.0,Alice,5,
