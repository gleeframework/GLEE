"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in.  My starting price is $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $115 is still a decent deal for Bob considering his value of $100. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm keeping the door open for negotiation with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in this product and think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. There's still room for me to get a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** We are only in Round 2, and I have 8 more rounds to explore getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's in the middle of our current positions, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $110 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to help him understand why this price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This is a fair price that gets us both closer to what we want. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Even though we're getting close, I'm not desperate.  There are still several rounds remaining, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $107.50 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $112.50.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small compromise, showing flexibility without dropping too low.
* **Maintaining Value:** $112.50 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, considering both of our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $112.50 is still too much for me. Let's try $109.  It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $109 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is Running Out:**  While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, we're now at Round 6, and time is becoming a factor. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price in the next few rounds. There's a good chance Bob will eventually agree to a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Round Strategy:** I'll likely propose a price slightly higher than $109, aiming to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll be prepared to consider selling to John in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $109 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $111.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 111}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Above Minimum:** $111 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a touch of urgency to my message, hoping to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal. 
* **Time is a factor:** We are now in Round 7, and I'm starting to consider the possibility of selling to John.  However, I still believe there's a chance to get a slightly better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $111 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm confident we can close the deal.  Let's make it happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're in Round 8, and I only have two rounds left before I have to decide whether to sell to John.
* **Deal Probability:** Bob seems eager to close the deal and has come up significantly in his offers.  There's a good chance that if I reject, he might not counteroffer again.

**Overall, it's a good deal for me considering the time constraint.  I'm willing to accept $110 to ensure a sale.**"
