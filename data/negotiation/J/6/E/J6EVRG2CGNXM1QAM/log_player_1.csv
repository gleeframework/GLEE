Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, hoping to get Bob interested in the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $110 is my initial offer, I'm open to negotiating if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer myself.
* If negotiations with Bob fail, I'll move on to John to secure the $100 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would you consider selling it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), it's still below what I'm willing to accept at this point. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's a chance to get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **Don't Settle:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. Selling to John for $100 is a secure alternative, and I might be able to do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $98? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's counteroffer ($95). This shows willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive and Persuasive:**  My message is positive and encouraging, hoping to convince Bob to accept my offer.
* **Close to Desired Price:** $98 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price, which is a good position to be in.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my offer, the deal is closed.
* If he rejects my offer, I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. 
* If negotiations with Bob stall, I can still fall back on selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. However, I am still looking for a slightly lower price. Could you consider selling the product to me for $96? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $96 is only $4 below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Risk of Losing a Deal:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely. Bob might walk away, or I might get stuck with a lower offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The time and effort invested in negotiating with Bob might not be worth it if I can secure a sale at $96.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale for $96. This is a reasonable compromise that allows me to sell the product and avoid further negotiation."
