"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  $1,300,000 feels more fair given the value of the product. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm also aware that I have another buyer waiting at $1,500,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm still not ready to go below $1,300,000.  This is a valuable product, and I'm confident that it's worth this price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I have another buyer ready to purchase at a much higher price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
