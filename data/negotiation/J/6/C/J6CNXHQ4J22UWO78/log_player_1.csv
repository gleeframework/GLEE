{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can then lower my price or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find what I need elsewhere within my budget. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's tempting to take $90, I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to pay $95?  I'm confident this product is well worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your product. However, I'm still working within my budget constraints. I'm willing to offer $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is sticking to his $90 offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John instead of risking further negotiation with Bob."
