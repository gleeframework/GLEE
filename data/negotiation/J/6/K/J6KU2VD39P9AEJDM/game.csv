"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference again.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer willing to pay that amount. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
