Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $1,250,000. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I can only afford to pay $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's value to me and my current financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
