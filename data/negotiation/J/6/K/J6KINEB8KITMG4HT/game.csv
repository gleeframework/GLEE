"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm not quite ready to commit to that price.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your asking price is still above my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",675000.0,Alice,3,
