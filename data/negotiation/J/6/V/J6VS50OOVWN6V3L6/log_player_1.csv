{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.  Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always beneficial to aim for a higher profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at this price or lower would be leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a buyer at your desired price, so you're not pressured to accept a lowball offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale at a good price and potentially maximizing your profit if Bob accepts the initial offer."
