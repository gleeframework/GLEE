Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price significantly above your baseline.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and a ""fair price"", you subtly anchor Bob's thinking to a higher price point than $10,000.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at selling the product ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** While John represents a guaranteed $10,000, aiming higher with Bob is strategically sound. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance you'll still exceed the $10,000 mark."
