"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense potential and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially get a better price. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** There's time to explore a lower price without rushing into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Justified Price:**  $1,000,000 is still well above Alice's value for the product, suggesting you're open to a deal, but also showing you're not afraid to push for a better price.
* **Focus on Potential:**  Highlighting the potential of the product can help sway Alice.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation, allowing for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is below my bottom line.  I'm confident this product will bring you significant returns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While she has moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. 
* **You're aiming for the best deal.**  You're willing to keep negotiating to try and get the price even lower. 
* **You have time.**  There are still 7 rounds left, giving you ample time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This would still provide you with a healthy profit, and it's a price I can comfortably work with. Let's try to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  By only raising your offer slightly, you show a genuine desire to close the deal but maintain leverage. 
* **Highlighting Profit:**  Emphasize the profit Alice will still make, making the price seem more reasonable.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:**  Framing the offer as a win-win scenario can make Alice more likely to accept.
* **Open to Compromise:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and negotiation, showing you're willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but we seem to be at an impasse. While I believe in the value this product offers you, I also have other interested buyers.  My final offer is $1,100,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my strong desire to do business with you.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll need to pursue other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer:**  Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer. 
* **Close to your desired price:**  While $1,100,000 is still above your ideal price, it's getting closer to the range you're comfortable with. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  You have 5 rounds left, but there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price. It's possible Alice may walk away.
* **John's price:**  If you reject Alice's offer, you can buy from John for $1,500,000. This is a significantly higher price, making Alice's final offer seem more attractive. 

**It's a calculated risk.**  Accepting the offer might not be ideal, but it's a better option than buying from John or risking losing the deal with Alice."
