"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $850,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value and my willingness to close a deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the value while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
