"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you (Bob) can get a better deal from John. John is offering the product for $1,200,000, saving you $100,000. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John is the best strategy."
