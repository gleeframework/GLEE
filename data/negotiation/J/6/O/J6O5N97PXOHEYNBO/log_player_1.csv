"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for return."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the highest possible price, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high initial price.
* **Future Rounds:** This first offer sets the stage for negotiation. We can gradually lower the price in subsequent rounds, gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **John as Leverage:**  The knowledge that John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. We can walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't meet our expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still below our target.  We have room to negotiate further, especially knowing we have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the true value of this product is far greater than what you've proposed. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price by $200,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the decrease is calculated to keep us significantly above both Bob's valuation and John's offer.
* **Reaffirming Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's intrinsic worth and potential to generate returns for Bob. This reinforces the justification for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By proposing $2,000,000, we're still aiming high, encouraging Bob to counter with a more substantial offer. We're setting the stage for a potential agreement closer to our desired range.
* **John in the Background:** John's offer provides a safety net, allowing us to confidently negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which is a significant reduction from my original offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation. However, $1,600,000 is still below John's offer. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary while still encouraging Bob to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer still falls short of what I consider a fair deal.  I'm open to finding an agreement, but I also have other interested buyers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and signaling our willingness to walk away. This can push Bob to make a more serious offer.
* **Slight Concession:**  The decrease to $1,900,000 shows some flexibility, but it's a calculated risk.  We're still significantly above John's offer and hoping Bob will recognize the value and meet us closer to this price.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" subtly reminds Bob we have options, strengthening our negotiating position.
* **Clear Call to Action:** We end with a direct call to action, prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have other interested buyers, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,850,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is significantly higher than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. 
* **Strong Position:** While we presented $1,900,000 as our ""final offer,"" accepting slightly less still puts us in a very strong position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
