Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you'll be happy if he accepts.
* **It's below his perceived value:** $140 is below the $150 Bob values the product at, so it's likely he'll find it attractive.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for flexibility and gives Bob the feeling that he can get a good deal. 

By starting with a reasonable offer and being open to negotiation, you increase the chances of a successful sale while maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I am willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is close to your minimum, but you can likely do better. Since you have a backup option of selling to John for $120, it's worth holding out for a slightly higher price from Bob.  You'll counter with a slightly lower price than your initial offer to show you're willing to negotiate, but still aim for a better deal than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $135?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  You're meeting Bob halfway by lowering your price from $140 to $135. This shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintain Value:** $135 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  You're highlighting the value Bob gets by emphasizing it's still a good deal for him. 

This counteroffer strikes a balance between getting a better price and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to pay $132 for the product, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $132 is only $3 less than your counteroffer of $135.  Given that:

* You're comfortable selling to John for $120, 
* This is a pretty good price, 
* You're already at the 4th round of negotiation and there is no guarantee that Bob will accept your next counteroffer,

It's more strategic to accept Bob's offer and secure a deal.  You're still gaining more than you would from selling to John, and further negotiation might only lead to a stalemate."
