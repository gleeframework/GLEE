{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts high, recognizing that you don't know Bob's perceived value.  It also leaves room for negotiation, and the friendly tone encourages a continued conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth exploring if you can get a bit more.  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $15,000 is my absolute minimum, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $17,500.  This would allow me to make this sale worthwhile, while still giving you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16000. Would you be willing to consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise and is only $1,000 less than your last counteroffer.  It's worth accepting to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
