"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, as that's what I'd be willing to pay John for the same product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110. It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen.",110.0,Bob,4,
