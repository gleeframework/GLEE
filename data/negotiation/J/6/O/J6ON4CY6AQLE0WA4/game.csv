"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll see its value.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's potential value, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable starting at.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product. This reflects my understanding of its market value and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $800000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still getting a great price on the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm counteroffering at $900000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal - I'll include a premium service package that will enhance the product's performance and value. This is my final compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the added value of the service package,  $900000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you at $850000. This would be a fair price considering the added value and allows us to close this deal without further delay. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $850000, which is $875000. I'll also throw in an additional service package that will further enhance the product's value. This is my final compromise.",875000.0,Alice,7,
