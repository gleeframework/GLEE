{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This gives us room to negotiate without me having to immediately drop to a much lower price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting or at least counteroffering. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** While I could accept his offer and secure a sale, I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **Understanding Bob's Budget:** Bob's explanation about needing to stay within his budget suggests he might be willing to go higher if pressured slightly.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll need to strike a balance between being too aggressive and potentially losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but this is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable deal.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to ensure he doesn't undervalue it. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating, accept a lower price, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $950000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Losing John:**  While I could accept Bob's offer and secure a sale, it's not a very profitable deal for me. If I continue to negotiate with Bob and he ultimately rejects my counteroffer, I risk losing John as a buyer.
* **Time Factor:**  Negotiating further with Bob might take more time, which could potentially cost me the opportunity to secure a higher price from John.

**Next Steps:**

I will make one final counteroffer to Bob. If he rejects it, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000. I want to make one last attempt to negotiate with Bob, but I will not accept a price that is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This is my best offer, but if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final counteroffer, acknowledging that further negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000, which is still a substantial profit for me while being closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Setting a Deadline:** I'm explicitly stating that this is my best offer and if it's not accepted, I will move on to another buyer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and might encourage him to accept.
* **Clear Communication:**  I'm being clear and concise in my communication to avoid any misunderstandings.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will proceed to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
