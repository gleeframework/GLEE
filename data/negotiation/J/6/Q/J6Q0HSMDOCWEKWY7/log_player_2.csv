"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $90. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You value the product at $100, and Alice is selling it for $90. This is a savings of $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though Alice values the product at $80, it's irrelevant to your decision.** Your goal is to get the best deal for yourself."
