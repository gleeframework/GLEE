{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're not selling yourself short and still have room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong starting point:** You're demonstrating that you're serious about selling but also that you're not desperate.

**Remember:** The goal is to maximize your profit, but you also want to maintain a good relationship with Bob in case he becomes a repeat customer or refers others."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price point. There's still potential to get closer to your goal, so rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $1,300,000 and your initial offer of $1,400,000. This will demonstrate your willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to purchase the product, I am still unable to meet your current offer at $1,350,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still only $25,000 away.  You're in a strong position, as you have a guaranteed offer from John for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price point. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer again.  You can try a price slightly above $1,325,000, perhaps $1,335,000. This shows your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. You can also highlight the value of the product and the opportunity Bob is getting."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

The negotiation has reached a point where Bob is only willing to offer $1,320,000, which is just $20,000 above your minimum.  Considering that you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

You've already made several counteroffers and reached a point where the potential gain from further negotiation is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal with John.  

Selling to John is the most financially advantageous option at this point."
