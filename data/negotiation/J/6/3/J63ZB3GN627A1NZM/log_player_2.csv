"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her initial offer gives you a chance to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high, but it gives us a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $900,000 is a significant compromise from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for her to make a profit. 
* **Strategic Move:** By making a substantial counteroffer, we show Alice that we are serious about getting a deal but are also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000, it's still higher than the $900,000 I'm willing to pay.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By continuing to reject offers, I'm demonstrating my resolve to get a better price.  I'm hoping Alice will eventually come down closer to my offer. 
* **Avoiding Jhon:** Buying from Jhon at $1,500,000 is a last resort.  I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to $950,000, indicating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** This amount is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer ($1,100,000), showing that I am serious about getting a good deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** By raising my offer modestly, I'm gauging Alice's willingness to meet me halfway.  If she rejects, it might signal that she's not truly interested in a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my ideal price point. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd like to see a lower price, accepting this offer opens the door for potentially renegotiating the terms later (e.g., payment schedule) if the product has additional value beyond the base price. 
* **Avoiding Jhon:** This deal is still significantly better than buying from Jhon at $1,500,000."
