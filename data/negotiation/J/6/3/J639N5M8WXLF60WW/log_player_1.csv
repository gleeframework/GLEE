Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, we are still well above our minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
