"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. As we've discussed, it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that's significantly lower. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that this product has great potential, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle at $1,075,000? This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product will bring to you.
