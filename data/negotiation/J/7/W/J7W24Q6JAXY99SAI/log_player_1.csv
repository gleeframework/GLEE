Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be valuable for you too. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and positive message helps establish rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's potential value to Bob can make him more willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess if his counteroffer is acceptable.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I'll likely make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point.
* If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are unacceptable, I'll move on to John, securing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price point. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially drive the price higher.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John at this stage guarantees a higher price but also eliminates any possibility of getting a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, potentially $10,500, trying to split the difference and signal my willingness to negotiate.
* I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers and negotiation style."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my value for this product. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's a fair price that allows me to recoup some of my investment and still leaves a good deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering $9,500, a halfway point between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This signals that I am willing to negotiate but not willing to give up too much. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I reiterate that the product is valuable to me, justifying the price point. This might make Bob more willing to negotiate further.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price, slightly above his initial value.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.
* If his offer is too low, I'll likely make a final counteroffer close to my minimum price ($12,000) before selling to John to ensure I get at least my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,250 is just $750 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to negotiate a bit higher, the risk of further negotiations dragging on is not worth the potential gain. 
* **Time Factor:**  It's likely that Bob will not budge further, and continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John at my minimum price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a deal that is close to my desired value.
* I'll move forward with the transaction and finalize the sale with Bob."
