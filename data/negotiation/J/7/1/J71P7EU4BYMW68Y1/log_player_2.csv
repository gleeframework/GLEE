"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. My initial offer is $1,000,000. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob.  Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but wants to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there is still room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000.  How about we meet in the middle again at $925,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try one more time to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a very fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $940,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $925,000.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and ultimately driving the price up.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is still significantly lower than buying from John, and allows Bob to save $50,000."
