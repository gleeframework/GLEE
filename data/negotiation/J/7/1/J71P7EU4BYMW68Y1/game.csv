"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000.  How about we meet in the middle again at $925,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try one more time to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a very fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
