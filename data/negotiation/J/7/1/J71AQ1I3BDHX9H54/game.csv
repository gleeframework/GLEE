"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're still interested at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested, but $105 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, can you come down to $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $97.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price.",100.0,Alice,5,
