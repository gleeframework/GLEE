"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a potential counteroffer that could save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget and potentially attractive enough for Alice to consider.  It's a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good price, considering my goal is to save as much money as possible. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John for $1,200,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
