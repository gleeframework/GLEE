"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $9,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",9000.0,Alice,3,
