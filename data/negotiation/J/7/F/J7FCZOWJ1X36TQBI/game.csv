"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
