Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $75. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80.  Let's close this deal.

You have three options:

Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price I could get from John.  I'll accept his offer to close the deal."
