"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  However,  $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is a better offer than $22,000, it's still above your budget. You can likely negotiate further, especially since Alice acknowledged your perspective and is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the value we've both discussed."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To finalize the deal quickly, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Even though you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is high. Buying from John for $8,000 is the most financially sensible option in this situation."
