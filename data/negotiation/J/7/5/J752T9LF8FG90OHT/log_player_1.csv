Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $140 starts the negotiation at a point that's still profitable for me but leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (value) helps make the offer seem reasonable to Bob. 

This strategy balances getting the best possible price with maintaining a positive relationship and leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining bargaining power:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can explore if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives me a reasonable profit and leaves room for us both to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $125 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Fairness:** I'm highlighting that this price is still fair for both of us, acknowledging Bob's need for a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and puts me in a strong position to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Risk of further decline:** There's a risk that Bob might continue to lower his offer in future rounds. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, it's important to prioritize my financial goals.  Selling to John ensures a reliable outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further bargaining."
