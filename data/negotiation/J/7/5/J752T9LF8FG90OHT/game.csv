"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives me a reasonable profit and leaves room for us both to be happy. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
