"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price."",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than Alice's initial price ($140). This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $120 limit.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be polite and express interest while also clearly stating our budget limitations. This approach can encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  This still gives me a reasonable profit and leaves room for us both to be happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we can still try to push for a better deal. We're just $5 away from John's price, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($125) and our previous offer ($100). This tactic is often perceived as fair and can help move negotiations along.
* **Closing the Gap:** We're getting very close to both Alice's likely bottom line and our own budget limit. This offer increases the chances of Alice accepting while still leaving us some potential savings."
