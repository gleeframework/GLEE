Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me at the moment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price and is unlikely to move significantly closer to your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
