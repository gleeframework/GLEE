"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently looking to keep my expenses within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still unable to meet at $10,000. Could we perhaps aim for $9,000? This would be a significant improvement over my initial proposal and closer to what you're asking.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. It's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product at a price that's still within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I understand your position and am willing to move closer to your target. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we agree on $9,200 for the product?",9200.0,Bob,6,
