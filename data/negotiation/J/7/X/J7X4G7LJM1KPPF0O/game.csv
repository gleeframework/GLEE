"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm still willing to sell it to you at a discount.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,
