"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $22000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a great value for a product of this quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $22,000 is still outside my price range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $16,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $16000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $20000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $20,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a significant stretch. We've already established that Alice is willing to negotiate, so there's still room for a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $20,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $18,000. This is a significant step from my last offer, and I hope it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $19500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you still have some room to bargain. You are only $500 away from John's offer, so it is worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $19,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you at $19,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement finally."", ""product_price"": 19000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer it to you for $19500 is too low, but I can meet you at $19200. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** We've reached a point where Alice is only willing to budge by a small amount. You're now within $9200 of your budget. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving you $9200.  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or further negotiation taking up valuable time makes John the safer choice."
