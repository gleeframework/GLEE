"Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I can only offer $10000 at this time. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a compromise at $22000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a great value for a product of this quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $22000 is still outside my price range.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $16000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $16000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $20000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",20000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $20000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $18000. This is a significant step from my last offer, and I hope it's a price we can both agree on.",18000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $19500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",19500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer it to you for $19500 is too low, but I can meet you at $19200. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",19200.0,Alice,9,
