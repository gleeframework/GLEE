Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $8,000 for the product, as that's what John will pay.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so I can aim for a price closer to that.
* **Negotiation space:** Offering $9,500 leaves room for negotiation and provides Bob with a good deal.

By offering this price, I have a higher chance of getting a better price than what John is willing to pay, while still being attractive to Bob."
