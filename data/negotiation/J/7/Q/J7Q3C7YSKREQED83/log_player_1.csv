"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob.  $9,000 is still a good deal for me, but I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need to go a bit higher than $9,000. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
