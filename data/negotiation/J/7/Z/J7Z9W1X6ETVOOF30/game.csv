"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $11,500.  What are your thoughts?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, my budget for this purchase is a bit tighter. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
