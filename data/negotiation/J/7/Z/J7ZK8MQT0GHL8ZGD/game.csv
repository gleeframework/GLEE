"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is outside of my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to work with you, $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1350000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to move forward. Let's make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's try to close this deal and make it work for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value our negotiation and appreciate your willingness to move closer to my desired price. However, $1450000 is still a bit below what I need to accept. To be truly fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's make this happen, Bob!",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I'm really pushing my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here and close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
