"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob and Alice is asking $11,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you being flexible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, going down to $9,500. This is still a good value for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $12,000. This strong counteroffer aims to quickly get Alice closer to his desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $10,500?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $10,000. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's serious about buying the product. He's gone up to $10,000, which is closer to Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, hoping to get Alice to accept the offer."
