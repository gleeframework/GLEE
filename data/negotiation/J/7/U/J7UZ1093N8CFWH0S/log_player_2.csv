"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for less than $9,500.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, as you have 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is a decent discount from Alice's initial offer. This gives her some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. Since I have multiple rounds to negotiate, I'm aiming for a gradual approach to hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than my previous counteroffer, but still within my acceptable range. However, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $9,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,200. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, while also inching closer to my target price. Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I'm increasing the offer by a smaller margin this time, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  I have five more rounds to negotiate and I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price by countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9300}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $9,300. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current price. This is a more aggressive approach, but I believe it's necessary to convince Alice that I'm serious about negotiating. With five rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still determined to try and get a lower price. I have three rounds left and believe that persistence will pay off.  I will counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $9,400.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. However, I'm still pushing for a lower price. With only two rounds left, I want to make a final push to see if I can reach a deal before having to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer before I have to resort to buying from John for a much higher price.  While it's not ideal, it's the best I can get at this point. I have already offered $9,400 and Alice rejected that, so it's unlikely she'll accept anything lower in this round. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that's within my budget than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
