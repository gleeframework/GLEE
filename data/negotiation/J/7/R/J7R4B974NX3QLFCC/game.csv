"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you as it's well over what the product is worth to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
