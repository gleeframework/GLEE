Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I think that's a fair price considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
Let's break down why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming high initially allows you to potentially secure the highest possible profit margin. Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters your initial offer, there's a good chance the final price will remain well above your $800,000 safety net with John. 
* **Confident Presentation:** By starting with a strong offer, you present yourself as confident in the product's value. This can be persuasive to a potential buyer.

Remember, this is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he doesn't accept immediately."
