"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can meet you halfway. How about we settle on $140 for the product?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $130 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",115.0,Bob,6,
