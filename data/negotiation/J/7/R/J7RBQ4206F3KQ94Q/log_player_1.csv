"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to create a positive perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob's thoughts and clearly signaling that I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy allows for flexibility while aiming to secure the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum perceived value, leaving no room for negotiation upwards from his side. Accepting would mean selling significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  While selling to John is an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is considerably below the market value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **But Stand Firm:**  The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer, reinforcing that the product holds high value. 
* **Justify the Price:** By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price to an external factor, strengthening my position.

The goal is to find a middle ground that's still profitable while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches the price John is willing to pay. While there might be a slight chance of getting more from Bob, it's a significant risk. Accepting the $1,200,000 ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and avoids the possibility of Bob walking away in future rounds."
