"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is considerably below the market value of this product. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
