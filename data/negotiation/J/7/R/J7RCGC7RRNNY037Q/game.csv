"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product from another seller for $8,000.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty about the other seller's offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'll make a new counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
