Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum value of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, allowing for potential counteroffers and a final price that benefits both parties.
* **It's a strong initial offer:** It shows that you are serious about selling the product to Bob while leaving room for some back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and potentially less profitable. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,800 is still less than what you initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering Bob's offer history and the potential risk of losing the sale entirely. 

Here's why accepting is a good decision:

* **Closer to your target:** It's closer to your desired price point than John's offer.
* **Minimizes risk:** Accepting minimizes the risk of Bob backing out or you having to lower your price even further.
* **Possible future benefits:**  Building a positive relationship with Bob now might lead to future business opportunities."
