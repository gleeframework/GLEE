"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still think the product is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11200.0,Alice,5,
