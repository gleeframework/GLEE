"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a sound investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This allows you to get a great deal and me to receive a fair price.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
