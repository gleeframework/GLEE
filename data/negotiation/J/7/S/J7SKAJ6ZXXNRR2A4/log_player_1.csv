Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

While $9,800 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm not going to sell to John just yet."

It's getting down to the wire, and I'm starting to feel like Bob and I aren't going to reach a price that's acceptable to both of us. I don't want to risk running out of rounds and ending up with a price lower than I'd like. John has offered me a much better price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
