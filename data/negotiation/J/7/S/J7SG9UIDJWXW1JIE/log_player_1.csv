Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value and opportunity of the deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by inviting Bob to share his thoughts.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* Throughout the negotiation, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message shows he's still interested.  This means there's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is always available if I can't reach a deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* I'll continue to assess the situation, keeping in mind Bob's budget constraints and John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. It shows willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message highlights the discount from the initial asking price, emphasizing the willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm positioning this as a ""benefit"" for both parties, increasing the chances of acceptance. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the original price was $1,000,000 and you've already discounted it significantly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would be a significant financial loss.
* **John's Offer is a Better Deal:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a much more profitable option than accepting Bob's current offer. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  While Bob seems willing to negotiate, his offers are still too low. Further rounds of negotiation might not lead to a price I'm comfortable with. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  To maximize my profits, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I receive my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $775,000 is still below what I can accept for this product.  I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and I'm confident that its value justifies a higher offer. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer one final compromise: $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. This will be my final offer.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final counteroffer, aimed at finding a middle ground while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on Finality:** The message clearly states that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Highlighting the Discount:**  I'm again emphasizing the significant discount from my original price to show a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing this offer as being fair to both parties, hoping to incentivize acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Decision:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $1,000,000. 
* **No Further Negotiation:** I'm not willing to go any lower, and further rounds of negotiation would be unproductive."
