# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $775,000 is still below what I can accept for this product.  I've already come down significantly from my initial price, and I'm confident that its value justifies a higher offer. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer one final compromise: $825,000.
