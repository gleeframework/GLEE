Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be highly valuable for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $12,000 as my offer price. This is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him a potential gain, while still leaving me with a profit of $2,000. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation if he counters. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, I'm increasing the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a decent profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
