Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a profitable sale to John."
