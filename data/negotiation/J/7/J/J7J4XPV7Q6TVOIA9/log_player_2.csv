"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget, it's still a dollar more than what you're willing to pay. It makes sense to try and negotiate further to see if you can get the price down to your desired $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Since Alice values the product at $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation. Hopefully, she'll accept my counteroffer and we can close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $50,000 higher than my initial maximum.  While I could continue negotiating, it's now more beneficial to buy the product from John at my maximum budget. This ensures I get the product for the lowest possible price and avoids further negotiation."
