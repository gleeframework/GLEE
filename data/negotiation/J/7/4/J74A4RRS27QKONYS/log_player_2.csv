# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite comfortable with $115, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $125? It's still a great price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with it.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $125, and John offers the product at your target price. It's time to take the guaranteed deal."
