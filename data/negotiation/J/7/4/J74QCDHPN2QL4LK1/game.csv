"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $15,000 is your perceived value, I'm confident this product offers significant benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $15,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
