"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is still a decent amount, it's significantly below my minimum value for the product. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $750,000. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $725,000 is a more comfortable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can secure a better deal, especially with John as a backup option. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to finalize this. I'm willing to go down to $740,000. It's a fair price that's within both our comfort zones. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 740000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $720,000 is a more comfortable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. Bob's offers have been consistently lower than my minimum value, and we've reached a point where further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk another round with Bob that could result in a lower price."
