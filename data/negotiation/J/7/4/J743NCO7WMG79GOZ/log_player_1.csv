"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really like the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $105.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the extra few dollars."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $108.  How about we finalize this deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of rounds, I still believe I can get closer to my target price.  $108 is still too low, but I'll see if I can get him up a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference at $110.  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment, and this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 110}
