{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. $115 is still a bit more than what you're willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really like the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the extra few dollars. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$110 is still a bit more than you are willing to pay, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $108.  How about we finalize this deal at that price?"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference at $110.  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment, and this is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to budge from $110, and you're not comfortable paying that much. Since you're only willing to pay a maximum of $120, and you have the option to buy from John for that price, it's best to move on and purchase from John."
