Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, I can likely get closer to my minimum of $15,000 by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $15,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  We're getting closer, but I'm still not at my minimum price.  I want to see if I can get him to go higher before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're still hesitant, but  $13,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Would you be willing to go up to $14,000?  It's only a $1,000 difference, and it would be a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure if it's worth risking going lower and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price. I want to see if I can get Bob to go up to $14,000 before I make a decision."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but  $13,500 still isn't quite enough.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
