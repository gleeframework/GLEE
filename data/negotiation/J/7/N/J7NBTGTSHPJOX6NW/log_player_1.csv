Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down a bit.
* **Anchor Price:**  By starting at $12,000, you establish a high reference point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it makes your fallback position of $10,000 (with John) seem more reasonable.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at the possibility of further discussion (""Let me know if you're interested!""), signaling to Bob that you might be open to a lower price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Motivation:** We don't know how motivated Bob is to buy the product. If he's desperate, he might accept a higher price.
* **Relationship Building:** While maximizing profit is the goal, consider the potential for a future relationship with Bob. If you drive too hard a bargain, it might damage that possibility."
