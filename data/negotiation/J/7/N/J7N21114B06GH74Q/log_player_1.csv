Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, and I'm hoping it will give me room to negotiate. It's also important to remember that I have a safety net of $800,000 with John, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first counteroffer right away. I want to see if there's any room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and see what counteroffer he provides."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a price that's above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and it seems likely that further negotiation might not result in a higher price.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
