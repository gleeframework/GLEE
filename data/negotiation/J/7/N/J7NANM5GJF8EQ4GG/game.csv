"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but your price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1800000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a significant offer and shows my serious interest in the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1400000, which would be $1600000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However,  I'm really pushing the limits of my budget at this point.  I'm willing to go to $1500000, but I can't go any higher. This is a significant offer that demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
