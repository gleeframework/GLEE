"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $2,250,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. This is my best offer and reflects the maximum I can afford right now.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer.  While I recognize your perspective, the value of this product is significant.  I could come down to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects both the product's worth and your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that $1,800,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to purchase it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this amount.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
