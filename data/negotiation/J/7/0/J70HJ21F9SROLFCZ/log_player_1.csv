"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on the benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** This leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds if Bob counters.  I'm open to lowering the price slightly to close the deal, but I won't go below my minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of the backup option with John and will use it if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unattractive, he has shown a willingness to negotiate.  I can likely get closer to my target price by counteroffering.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is far too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** $90 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, making the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By staying above $90, I can potentially secure a higher price without resorting to selling to John.
* **Time is ticking:** We're already in round 3, so I need to be assertive while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate further. I can likely push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Time is a factor:** We are in round 4, so time is running out. While selling to John is a guaranteed option, I want to see if I can get a better price with Bob.
* **Building trust:**  I want to demonstrate that I am willing to work with Bob, but I also need to maintain my leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm decreasing my price again, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  $85 is still above my minimum and leaves room for a final compromise.
* **Creating urgency:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to close the deal.  It also reminds him that time is running out.
* **Fair compromise:**  $85 is a potential middle ground between our current positions. This creates a win-win scenario and makes the deal more likely. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value, but I'm not letting the negotiation stall completely."
