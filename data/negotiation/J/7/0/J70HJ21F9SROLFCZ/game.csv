"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is far too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great value for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  Let's close this deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
