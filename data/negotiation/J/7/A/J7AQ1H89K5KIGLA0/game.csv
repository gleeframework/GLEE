"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests and allows you to benefit from the product's value while also acknowledging its worth to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1000000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000 and your willingness to pay $1000000, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This price still allows you to benefit from the product while also reflecting its value to me.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
