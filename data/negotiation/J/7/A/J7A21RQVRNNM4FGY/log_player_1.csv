{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to quickly strike a deal. If Bob rejects, I'll  likely make a slightly higher counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $90?  I'm willing to be flexible, but that's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $90. Could we perhaps aim for $85 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $95. It's a good price for you, and I can live with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
