Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to frame the offer as a good deal and emphasize the product's value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down if necessary.
* **Backup Option:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $130 to $120, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reiterating that this is still a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting a middle ground to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Negotiation Focus:** I'm keeping the conversation focused on finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price range.
* **Risk of Further Lowering:** If I counteroffer again, I risk Bob lowering his offer further, potentially pushing me below my minimum threshold.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  John's offer of $150 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a more favorable outcome and avoid the uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob."
