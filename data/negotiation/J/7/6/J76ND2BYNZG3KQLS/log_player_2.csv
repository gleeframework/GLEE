Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a strong starting point for bargaining and signals Bob's serious intent to buy, but at a price closer to his target."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob wants to try to lower the price further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still not ideal. Bob has shown flexibility in his counteroffers, demonstrating his interest in the product. There's still a chance to negotiate a lower price, and Bob is unwilling to settle for a price that's so close to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to reach a compromise with Alice. This counteroffer is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's also at the edge of his budget, leaving little room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to either secure a deal at a favorable price or signal to Alice that further negotiation is unlikely, potentially pushing her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum budget, and it's unlikely she will lower it further. With only a few rounds left, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $800,000. This ensures he gets the product while staying within his budget and avoiding the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially missing out on the deal altogether."
