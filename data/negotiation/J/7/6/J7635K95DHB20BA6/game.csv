"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my best compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to pay $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
