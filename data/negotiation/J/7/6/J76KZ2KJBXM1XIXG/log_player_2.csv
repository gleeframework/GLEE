"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to aggressively lower the price. $5,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, and while it's still above Bob's maximum value, it gives him room to negotiate. This counteroffer is a starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is moving closer to his maximum value while still leaving some room for negotiation.  He's trying to find a middle ground between his desired price and Alice's offer, hoping she'll accept a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price that Bob is comfortable with. At this point, continuing to negotiate is risky, as there's no guarantee that Alice will eventually reach Bob's desired price. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum value, ensuring he gets the product without risking further price increases from Alice."
