Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** $120 is still lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him incentive to accept.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for counteroffers and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than $80 from John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before settling for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a great product and I think you'll really enjoy it! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's higher than Bob's $100 offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Lower than my initial offer:** It's lower than my initial $120 offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Still profitable:** $110 is well above my minimum of $80, ensuring I still make a decent profit. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to propose a price of $95 if it's possible. This would allow me to purchase the product within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still a decent profit considering the negotiation process. I'd rather accept Bob's offer and get the transaction done than risk further haggling and potentially ending up selling to John for $80."
