Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but lower than my minimum desired value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** By leaving room for negotiation, I'm inviting Bob to make a counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider:

* **His Counteroffer:** If his offer is close to my minimum desired value ($15,000), I might accept it.
* **His Negotiation Style:** If Bob is aggressive or unwilling to compromise, I might consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a considerable loss for me. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested in the product. This means there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a more favorable deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired value of $15,000 while still remaining within a reasonable range for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Language:**  The message uses positive language to maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, which can improve negotiation outcomes.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyzing Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal! If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John. 
* **Considering Selling to John:** If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000.  I'm always looking for the best possible outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum desired value of $15,000. Accepting it would mean a small loss for me, but it's still a decent profit considering the lower end of his initial offer.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely.  
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation could cost me time and energy, which is valuable.  

**Next Steps:**

Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'll still keep John in mind as a backup option in case any issues arise in the future."
