"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $9500 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? This would give me some room to work with and make the purchase possible.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 9500 was a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of 9000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9000 is still a bit high for me though.  I'm happy to meet you at $8500. This feels like a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 9000 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to 8500. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of 8800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. I'm still a bit away from what I can comfortably spend though.  I'm willing to go up to $8600 for the product. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",8600.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 8800 was still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to 8600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a price of 8700. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,7,
