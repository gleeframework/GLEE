Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves a decent profit margin for Bob, making it likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price range. I believe I can get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm willing to compromise, but $11,000 is still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

```

Bob's offer is now my minimum price, but I don't see any further room for negotiation. At this point, it's more efficient to sell to John and avoid further negotiations."
