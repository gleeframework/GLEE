Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), ensuring a profitable sale even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

**Why not higher?**

While aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000 might seem tempting, it risks Bob immediately rejecting the offer. This would force you to sell to John at your minimum price, leaving potential profit on the table."
