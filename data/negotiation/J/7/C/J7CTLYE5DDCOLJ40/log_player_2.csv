"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Bob starts with a strong counteroffer, aiming to secure a significant discount. $9,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer.
* **Sets a Clear Limit:** This establishes Bob's budget and signals his seriousness about negotiating. 
* **Polite Tone:**  Maintaining a respectful tone throughout the negotiation is crucial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Even though it's a significant reduction from her initial offer, Bob is better off rejecting it and continuing to negotiate for a lower price. He can potentially get the product for a lower price than John's offer by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob makes it clear that $10,000 is his absolute limit. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** He reinforces his willingness to pay the price, emphasizing that it's a fair value for him.
* **Sets the Stage for a Decision:**  This gives Alice a clear choice: accept Bob's offer or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10400. This is the absolute limit, and I'm not willing to budge any further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,400 is still above Bob's budget, but he has a reliable alternative with John offering the product for $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing the deal with John and potentially ending up with a higher price. It's best to take the guaranteed deal from John and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
