Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let me know if you're open to this final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10400. This is the absolute limit, and I'm not willing to budge any further. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,5,
