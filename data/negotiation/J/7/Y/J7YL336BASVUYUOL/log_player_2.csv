{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to my maximum, I can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There are 9 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I'd like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. With 7 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and try to push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $87.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. After considering your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $2 more than my ideal price of $87.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a better deal is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether.  At this price, I'm comfortable buying from Alice."
