"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential"" and ""significant benefits"" aims to frame the product's value in a positive light, even at a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** The initial high price leaves ample room for Bob to negotiate downward, hopefully within a range that remains profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the product's actual value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:**  The counteroffer is a substantial decrease from the initial price, signaling flexibility. However, it remains well above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again emphasizes the product's value and potential returns, subtly reminding Bob of its benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility.  A significant counter from him would suggest he's truly interested. A lowball offer would indicate you might be better off with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for me. I can do $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's offer increased slightly, but it's still far below your minimum. This slow pace suggests he might be trying to wear you down.
* **Alternative Available:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price.  There's no need to settle for a significantly lower amount yet.
* **Room for Maneuvering:** With several rounds remaining, you can still attempt to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, and I want to be straightforward. I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,250,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** Introducing the ""other buyer"" creates a sense of competition and potential loss for Bob, encouraging him to act decisively.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as your ""final offer,"" you aim to elicit Bob's best offer without further prolonged negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is slightly above your guaranteed sale price with John, leaving some room for Bob to potentially meet or exceed it. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Despite the firm stance, you reiterate the product's value to Bob, reinforcing the idea that this is a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but $1,250,000 is still too much. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offer increases are getting smaller, and he's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.
* **Ultimatum Ignored:** Bob's ""final offer"" disrespects your previous ""final offer"" and suggests he's not negotiating in good faith. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at a price that exceeds Bob's current ""final"" offer and meets your desired value. It's time to cut your losses and move on. 

**Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point carries more risk than potential reward.**"
