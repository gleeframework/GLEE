While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He should reject and counteroffer again."

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget, but $1,025,000 is still too high.  He's better off buying from John at $800,000 and saving the extra $225,000."
