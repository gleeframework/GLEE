"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that the product is worth it to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
