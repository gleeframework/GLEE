"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that the product is worth it to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
