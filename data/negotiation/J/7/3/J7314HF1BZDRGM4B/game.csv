"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's value. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
