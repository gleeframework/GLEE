{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $1,000,000. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, aiming for a good profit margin. The message tries to pique Bob's interest and emphasize the product's unique value. It leaves room for negotiation, but sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Since Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John, there's no reason to risk further negotiation. Selling to John ensures a swift and secure transaction at my minimum price."
