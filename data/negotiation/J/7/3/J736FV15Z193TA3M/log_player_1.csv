Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as much above that as possible from Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($18,000) sets an anchor point for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land above your minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob less likely to overthink and potentially lose the deal. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit."
