"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should reject the offer. $9,500 is a good price, but Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. While $8,000 is better than Alice's first offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to offer you a small discount and sell the product to you for $8200. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer. Alice's counteroffer of $8,200 is within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price. While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers or become less willing to compromise. This is a good deal, and Bob should accept it to avoid losing the opportunity to buy the product at a lower price than John's offer."
