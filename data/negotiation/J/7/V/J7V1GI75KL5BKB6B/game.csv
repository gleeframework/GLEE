"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is still quite a bit below the value of this product. I'm prepared to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $950,000, as I mentioned earlier. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,6,
