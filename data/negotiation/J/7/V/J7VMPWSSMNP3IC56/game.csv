"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $1,200,000?  I believe this price is still fair for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you while respecting my own value for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident that $1,250,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  It allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
