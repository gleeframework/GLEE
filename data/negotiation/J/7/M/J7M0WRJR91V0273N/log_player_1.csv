Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the value of the product might encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to negotiate, keeping the door open for a deal. 

This strategy aims to get a good starting price and leaves room for adjustments depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value & Margin:** While $13,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation but need to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. I have several rounds remaining, and there's potential to find a price that works for both of us.
* **John's Offer:**  Having a backup offer from John provides security. If I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John."

Round 3

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my initial price.

* **Value Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce my pricing.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message again shows I'm still open to negotiation.

This strategy aims to maintain a strong position while still creating a path for a mutually agreeable deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I think we can do better than that. Can you meet me at $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **John's Offer:**  The backup offer from John provides a safety net. If I can't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000.
* **Rounds Remaining:** We still have several rounds left. This gives me time to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still a bit below my acceptable price. How about we split the difference at $13,375? This would be a fair compromise, and it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13375}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This shows willingness to compromise by suggesting a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** The price still reflects the product's value and is closer to my desired price.
