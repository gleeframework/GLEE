Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to see if I can get a better deal. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  I'm willing to risk losing a small amount of profit to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay more."
