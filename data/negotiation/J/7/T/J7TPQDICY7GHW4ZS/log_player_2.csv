"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $10000 for it?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $10,000, while John is selling it for $12,000.
* **You are still saving money:**  You value the product at $12,000, and you can get it for $10,000 from Alice. This is a $2,000 saving."
