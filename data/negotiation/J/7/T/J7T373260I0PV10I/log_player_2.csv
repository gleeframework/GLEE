"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $110 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still a reasonable markup from her value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message maintains a friendly and open tone, encouraging continued discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price we're comfortable with, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further down. We're aiming for something closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering $95, we're meeting Alice halfway between our previous offer ($90) and her counteroffer ($100). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Seeking a Fair Deal:**  The message emphasizes finding a price that works well for both parties. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to our maximum price, but we still have a few rounds to potentially secure a better deal."
