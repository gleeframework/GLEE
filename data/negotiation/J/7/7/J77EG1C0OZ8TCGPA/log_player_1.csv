Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale to John at $120 provides a safety net, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
