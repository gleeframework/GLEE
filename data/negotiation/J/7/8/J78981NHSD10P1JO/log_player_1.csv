Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly valuable for someone like you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $22,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Value justification:**  The message hints at the product's value to Bob specifically, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Urgency and exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and exclusivity (""before I list it publicly"") can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll still get your guaranteed $15,000 from John, but you miss the opportunity for a higher profit."
