# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also include a 2% discount on the total price, which would bring it down to $1,065,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, and the additional discount makes it an attractive deal.  While I still have a few rounds left,  buying from Alice at this price is a good deal compared to my alternative option of buying from John for $1,500,000."
