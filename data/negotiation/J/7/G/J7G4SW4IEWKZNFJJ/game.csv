"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and leaves room for us both to walk away with a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad we could have this conversation. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a price we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product. This gives us both a good margin and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it leaves room for us both to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's close this out.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also include a 2% discount on the total price, which would bring it down to $1,065,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1065000.0,Alice,7,
