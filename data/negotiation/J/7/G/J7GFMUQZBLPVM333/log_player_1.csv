Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, $200 was already a discounted price and going down to $80 would mean selling it at a significant loss.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price considering my budget and your asking price.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while $100 is more than his initial offer, it's still a significant loss compared to selling to John.  It's time to cut negotiations and take the guaranteed $150."
