Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I believe a price of $890,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 890000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $890,000 represents a markup of just over 11%, which is within a reasonable range for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle and still secure a profit above your baseline.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and offering Bob a priority opportunity."
