"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value to me. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that takes into account both our perspectives, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to your desired price range. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that further counteroffers could lead to Alice walking away or you running out of rounds.  It's a good deal for you, especially compared to buying from John for $1,500,000."
