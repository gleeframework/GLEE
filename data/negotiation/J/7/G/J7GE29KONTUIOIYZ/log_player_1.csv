Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  Given the product's value to you, I believe a price closer to $1,050,000 would be a fair starting point for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
