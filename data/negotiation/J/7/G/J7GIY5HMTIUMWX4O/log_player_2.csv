"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $125 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a good deal, you can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $125 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is within your budget and a good price considering the product's value. There's a chance you might be able to negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and having to buy from John for $150 is too high. Accepting the offer at $115 is the best option for maximizing your savings while still getting the product."
