Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can get from it.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $750,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $800,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $780,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. John guarantees the $800,000, and continuing negotiations with Bob has a lower expected payoff at this point."
