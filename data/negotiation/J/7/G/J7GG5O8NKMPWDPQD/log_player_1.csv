{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values it at $800,000, we don't want to lowball him and risk offending him. This offer is a significant markup for us but still potentially attractive to him.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a guaranteed buyer mitigates that risk."
