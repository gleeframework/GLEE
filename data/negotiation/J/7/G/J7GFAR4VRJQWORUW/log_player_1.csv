Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going. 
* **It's not too high:**  A very high offer might immediately make Bob walk away.

Remember, you can always use John as your fallback option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can't pay more than $750,000 for it. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  While it's tempting to take the $750,000, it's less than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **You have a better option:**  You can always sell to John for $800,000, guaranteeing you your minimum. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired value.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  The product holds a lot of value, and I believe a price of $800,000 is fair considering its worth to you.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm on your minimum:**  You're not willing to go below your minimum acceptable price, but you're still willing to negotiate.
* **Finality:** Stating this is your ""final offer"" adds pressure to Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Focus on value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him may make him reconsider his initial offer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to wait for Bob's response to your counteroffer.  He can either accept or reject it. If he rejects, you can either accept John's offer or try to negotiate again."
