Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer gives me a profit of $15, which is a good start. It's also likely to be attractive to Bob since it's below his valuation of $120.  However, it leaves room for negotiation if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That would still be a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
