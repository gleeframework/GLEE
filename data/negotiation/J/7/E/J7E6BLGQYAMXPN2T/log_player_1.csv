Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so the maximum price he'd theoretically be willing to pay is slightly below that. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

By starting high, you increase your chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
