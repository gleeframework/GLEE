,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to take $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $105.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That seems fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $107.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let me know if that works for you.",107.5,Bob,4,
