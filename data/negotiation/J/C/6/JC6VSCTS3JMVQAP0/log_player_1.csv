Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially make a good profit while giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing some willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again to try and push the price higher."

This offer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's only $500 above his offer, but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal without resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I've already made significant concessions. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, John is offering a significantly better price, exceeding my minimum.  I will sell the product to John."
