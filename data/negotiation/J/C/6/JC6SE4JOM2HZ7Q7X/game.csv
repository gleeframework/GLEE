"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for my budget right now. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a one-time compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $780,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $820,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
