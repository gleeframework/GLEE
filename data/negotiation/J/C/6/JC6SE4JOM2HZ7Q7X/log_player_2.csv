"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $900,000 to see how much she's willing to budge."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a one-time compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $780,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer the product to you for $820,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While I could push for a slightly lower price, the difference is minimal at this point. Accepting at $820,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
