Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but still leaves room for a profitable deal for you.
* **Is significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **Is a clear, concise offer:** It makes it easy for Bob to understand your intentions. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale. Keep in mind the value of your product to you, Bob's potential counteroffers, and the backup option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I know you value the product at $1,500,000, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What about $1,050,000?  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me. It is better to reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point and potentially reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is within a reasonable range:** This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights the value of the product.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** Highlighting that this offer is a ""good deal for both of us"" encourages Bob to see the value and potentially come to an agreement.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  Using phrases like ""work together"" and ""find a solution"" promotes a cooperative atmosphere. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering with a price closer to my minimum, I'm attempting to secure a more profitable sale while still maintaining a potential deal with Bob."
