"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product for $95 when you can get it from John for $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm offering $75. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's below Alice's minimum price but still leaves room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price, it's still above my target. I'll reject and try to negotiate further to see if I can get it down to $80 or less."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $80. If she rejects this, I'll buy from John for the same price."
