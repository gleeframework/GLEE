"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to find a more reasonable middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? This acknowledges the value while allowing room for a profitable agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a significant gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents my maximum budget for this particular product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. I'm ready to make this work though. If you're serious about acquiring it, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the absolute lowest price I can consider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
