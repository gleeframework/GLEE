Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. I'm ready to make this work though. If you're serious about acquiring it, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the absolute lowest price I can consider.
