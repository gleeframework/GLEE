Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think that's a fair price for the product's value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $12,200? It's still a good compromise, and I think the product's value is worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $12,200.  At this point, John's offer of $12,000 is a better deal and saves further negotiation."
