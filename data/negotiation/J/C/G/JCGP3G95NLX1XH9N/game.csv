"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price and gets us both closer to what we want.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $115. That's as close to your last offer as I can get.",115.0,Alice,7,
