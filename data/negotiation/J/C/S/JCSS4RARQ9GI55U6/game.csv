"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I would get from this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,100,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000, but that's my final offer.",1110000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're not making much progress here. I've been very transparent with my position, and I need to be respectful of my other options. I'm willing to consider a final price of $1,095,000, but this is absolutely as low as I can go.",1095000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,8,
