"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I would get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $1,100,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,125,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is moving closer to our desired price range. Accepting $1,075,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table.  We need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary to maintain a stronger bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,110,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:**  We've countered twice now. It's time to establish a firm stance and signal that we're close to our limit. 
* **Alternative:** By mentioning this is our final offer, we subtly remind Bob that we have the option of going with John.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down slightly to $1,110,000 shows some flexibility but keeps us well above our minimum. 

This approach aims to bring Bob closer to our desired price while preparing him for the possibility that this negotiation might end soon if an agreement isn't reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we try $1,090,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to our walk-away point.  While $1,090,000 is tempting, we've clearly established our position, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer maintains the pressure and shows we're serious about our $1,110,000 final offer (even if it isn't actually final in our minds).  Bob is highly likely to counter again, and we'll then gauge whether to accept a slight compromise or walk away."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're not making much progress here. I've been very transparent with my position, and I need to be respectful of my other options. I'm willing to consider a final price of $1,095,000, but this is absolutely as low as I can go."",
""product_price"": 1095000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimatum:** We're entering the final stages of negotiation. It's time to present a final offer with a strong sense of urgency.
* **Slight Compromise:** By coming down to $1,095,000, we're showing a slight willingness to compromise, but we're also holding firm to a price point that's still significantly above our minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're reminding Bob of the dwindling rounds and the possibility of walking away. This might encourage him to accept our final offer rather than risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly deviated from his previous negotiation pattern and dropped his offer substantially. This indicates either:

* **Bad Faith:** Bob might be employing a pressure tactic hoping we'll panic and accept a much lower price. 
* **Misunderstanding:** He may have misinterpreted our firmness as a willingness to accept a lower price to close the deal quickly.

In either case, accepting this offer sets a dangerous precedent and significantly undervalues the product. We've consistently negotiated above $1,090,000. Accepting $1,050,000 is a $40,000 loss compared to our previous minimum and only a $50,000 gain over our guaranteed sale to John. 

At this point, the risk of continuing with Bob outweighs the potential reward. It's time to walk away and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
