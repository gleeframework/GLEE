"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential and market value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding terms that work for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the product's true value significantly exceeds that figure. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, anything above $700,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  Your understanding of this product's value is spot on. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $850,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $850,000 is tempting.  However, I need to stay within a certain budget on this purchase. Would you be willing to settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  Let's make this work. How about we split the difference and close the deal at $787,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.",787500.0,Alice,7,
