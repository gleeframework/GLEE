"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, I'm looking to get the best deal possible. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a good deal for both of us,  and I believe we can finalize the transaction quickly. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
