"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000.
