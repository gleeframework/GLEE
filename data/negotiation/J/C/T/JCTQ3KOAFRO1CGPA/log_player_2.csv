"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($12,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high for me too. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,500.** This is still above Alice's minimum value ($12,000), but it's a good compromise and within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,500** compared to buying from John. 
* **There is limited time remaining:**  Each round is valuable, and further negotiation might lead to a slightly better price but could also risk running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
