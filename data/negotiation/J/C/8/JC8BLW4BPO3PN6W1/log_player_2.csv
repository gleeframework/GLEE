"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:**  $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000 than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  Bob has already made a counteroffer and been rejected. Further negotiation might lead to a lengthy process, and there's no guarantee of a better price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer and continues to negotiate, there's a chance Alice might decide to sell to someone else or simply walk away.

**Overall:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option. It saves Bob money compared to buying from John and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
