{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focusing on the mutual benefit of the deal. I'm also keeping the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit.
* I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations.
* I'm ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'll keep John's offer in mind to avoid going too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'm going to counter-offer and try to reach a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price.
* **Counter-Offering:** I'll make a counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't go too low in my counter-offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price of $1,075,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position while maintaining my own stance. I'm suggesting a compromise and highlighting the mutual benefit.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm making a counter-offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise to signal my willingness to be flexible and increase the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **John's Offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If Bob rejects my counter-offer, I'm prepared to either accept his counteroffer or go with John's offer."
