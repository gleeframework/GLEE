Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.

This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
