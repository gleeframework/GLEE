"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I receive a fair price.  How about $1,600,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's work together to find a solution.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,600,000 is closer, but still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
