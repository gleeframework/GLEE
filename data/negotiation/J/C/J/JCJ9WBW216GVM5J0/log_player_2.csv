Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product at a price that reflects its unique value.  I'm asking $1,750,000. I believe this price is fair considering its potential worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to make sure I receive a fair price.  How about $1,600,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,600,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering John's offer, as there's still room for a compromise that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,600,000 is closer, but still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
