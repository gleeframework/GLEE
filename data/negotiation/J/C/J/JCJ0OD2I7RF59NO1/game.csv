"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $9500 is unfortunately still below my minimum for this product.  However, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $11250?  This is a fair price considering the value you've acknowledged, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to move closer to my desired price. While $10500 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $11000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away with a good outcome. I'm confident that the product will be worth more than this to you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
