Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value, so I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still maintaining a significant margin above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while also trying to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm raising my counteroffer again, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This is my final counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I've already made multiple counteroffers.  To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell to John."
