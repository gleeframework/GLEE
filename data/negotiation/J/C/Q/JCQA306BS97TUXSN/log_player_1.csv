Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping to get as close to that value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than my minimum of $800,000, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair considering the value of the product and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable price to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good price for the product and it's getting closer to my desired value.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's always the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale entirely."
