Round 2

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price than it is to his maximum. There's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget considerations, Bob.  While $9,500 represents a fair price given the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This offer reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}"

# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Alice. Considering my budget, I'd like to propose $8,750 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Bob is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and $8,750 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of him going lower or the time to continue negotiating."
