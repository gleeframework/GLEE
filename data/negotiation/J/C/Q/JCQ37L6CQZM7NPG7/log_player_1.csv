Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also acknowledging Bob's potential value assessment. This initial offer sets a strong starting point for the negotiation, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'm aiming to maximize my profit, selling to John for $15,000 is currently a safer option than accepting Bob's offer and potentially losing money.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than my initial offer of $14,000, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still reflects the significant value of the product. Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to strengthen my position.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, implying flexibility.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground while maintaining a profit margin. If Bob rejects, I can reassess my position and either lower my offer again or accept John's offer for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still unable to go above $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these two prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target profit margin.  With each round of negotiation, Bob has shown a willingness to pay only slightly more, suggesting he might not be willing to budge further.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a better outcome than potentially continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

Given Bob's consistent reluctance to increase his offer significantly, continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower final price or a longer, drawn-out process.  Choosing to sell to John provides immediate certainty and a more favorable financial outcome."
