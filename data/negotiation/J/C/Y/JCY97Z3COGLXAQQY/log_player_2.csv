"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's more than double what the product is worth to Bob. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  $19,000 is too high for Bob. He should reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I do want to see if we can make this work.  Would you consider $16,000? This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high for Bob. He should continue negotiating, as he is willing to pay up to $10,000 and may be able to reach a deal closer to that amount.  It's always better to keep negotiating to see if a more favorable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000. It's a fair price for a product worth that amount to me. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
