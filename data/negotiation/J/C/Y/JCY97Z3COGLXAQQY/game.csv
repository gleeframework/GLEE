"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. However, I do want to see if we can make this work.  Would you consider $16,000? This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000. It's a fair price for a product worth that amount to me. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,
