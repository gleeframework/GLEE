Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

This is a significant reduction on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $10,000. It's a fair price for a product worth that amount to me. If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is clearly unwilling to move significantly from his offer of $10,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price acceptable for me.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
