"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for the same amount. Let me know your thoughts!",12500.0,Alice,1,
