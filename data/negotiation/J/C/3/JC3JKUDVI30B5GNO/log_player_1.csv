Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Sale:** The price is still significantly higher than John's offer ($100), ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
