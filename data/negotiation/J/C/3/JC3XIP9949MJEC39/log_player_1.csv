Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob a chance to get a good deal, but not so good that he feels he's losing out.
* **It's lower than your fallback price:** This ensures you still make a profit if Bob rejects the offer, while leaving room to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
