**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with Alice further or potentially find another seller offering a lower price.  He doesn't need to immediately commit to John's offer."
