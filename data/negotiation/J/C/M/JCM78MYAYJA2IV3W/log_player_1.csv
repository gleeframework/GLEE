{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is well above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Justification:** I provide a brief justification for the price, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of getting a good price.
* **Encourage Negotiation:** An open-ended question invites Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** If Bob rejects my offer, I'm still ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $90 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation further and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Avoiding Immediate Settlement:**  Selling to John for $80 would be a quick and easy solution, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price of $120, but acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $120.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?  It's a great deal for you and still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price but still acknowledges Bob's initial offer.
* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm proposing a ""meet in the middle"" price of $105, framing it as a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Strong Argument:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product and emphasize the potential for a good deal.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain Control:** I'm leading the negotiation and signaling my commitment to a higher price.
* **Increase Profit Potential:** $105 is significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Preserve Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can further adjust my offer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $105, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $95 is only $5 away from my previous offer of $105 and is significantly closer to my initial asking price of $120. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, this is a good deal and represents a decent profit margin.
* **Avoiding Further Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $80.

**Conclusion:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
