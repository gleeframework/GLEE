"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Strong Value Proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $1,125,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than both your minimum acceptable price and the product's value to him. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer is significantly below the product's true value.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its unique benefits."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:**  We're firmly rejecting Bob's lowball offer and reiterating the product's high value.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While still aiming high, we're making a significant concession to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and entice Bob to engage more seriously. 
* **Focus on Value:**  We're continuing to emphasize the product's unique qualities to justify the price. 

The goal is to bring Bob closer to a realistic price point while being mindful that we have a strong alternative with John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  Let me know if that's closer to what you had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, but it's still significantly lower. We are better off countering again to see if we can bridge the gap further before settling for anything less than $1,500,000. We still have John as a reliable backup if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to close the deal.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ $1,750,000. This reflects the product's real worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  We recognize Bob's upward movement and signal a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing a price directly between our previous offer and his counteroffer shows flexibility and encourages reciprocation. 
* **Final Push:** We're getting closer to the later stages of negotiation, and this offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely. 

This is a strong strategic move to encourage Bob towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort to find common ground. However,  $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation or going to John, as we won't get a better outcome. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome for us."
