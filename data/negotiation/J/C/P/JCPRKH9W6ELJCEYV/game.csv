"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This takes into account your interest and allows for a reasonable profit margin.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $1025000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
