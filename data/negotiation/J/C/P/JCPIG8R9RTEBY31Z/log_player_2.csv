{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $750,000, which is within my acceptable range. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending up buying from John at a much higher price is not worth it.  $750,000 is a good deal and a significant saving compared to John's price."
