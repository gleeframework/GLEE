"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too high, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're still trying to save money. $110 is better than $120, but you're still aiming for a lower price.  You can try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high at $110. Let's split the difference and go with $105.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. This is as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While you could keep negotiating, Alice has already come down quite a bit. You're only $5 away from your desired price, and you only have 5 rounds left. Accepting her offer is the best way to ensure you get the product at a good price without risking having to buy it from John for a much higher price."
