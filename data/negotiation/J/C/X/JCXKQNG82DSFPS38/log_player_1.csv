``` 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob is unlikely to offer much more, and you risk him walking away or you wasting time you could be selling to John.
* **Opportunity Cost:** You have a guaranteed offer from John. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to move on to other potential deals."
