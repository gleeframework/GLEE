{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

There's still a chance to close the deal at a price closer to your target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000} 
```

Alice is testing the waters, seeing if you'll go higher.  This counteroffer is a compromise, inching closer to Alice's last offer while staying below your maximum. It shows a willingness to negotiate but also sticks to your commitment to a lower price. This should push Alice towards accepting or coming down in price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is again moving up in price, likely testing your limits. While it's tempting to accept, you're still within range to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to compromise. You still have several rounds left to close a deal at a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push you towards accepting a higher price.  This counteroffer moves closer to her last offer but stays within your budget.  It's a final attempt to close the deal at a reasonable price before you have to consider John's offer.  If Alice rejects this, you'll be left with few rounds to make a deal with her, and buying from John becomes a more likely option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing for a price that's getting dangerously close to John's offer. With only one round left, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a better price with Alice.  At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
