"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I need to be at $975,000 to make this work. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",975000.0,Alice,5,
