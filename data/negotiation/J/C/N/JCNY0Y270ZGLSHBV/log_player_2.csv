"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so offering slightly above that gives him a strong starting point for negotiation. This offer is still within his budget, but pushes Alice closer to her minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's still within his budget. However, Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. He can try a counteroffer closer to the $10,500 mark,  hoping to split the difference and reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a compromise.  He's raised his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer splits the difference between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, giving Alice a better deal than before while still allowing Bob to save money compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still too high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and he's willing to continue negotiating. He believes there's still room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk here. He's raising his offer again, but only by a small amount.  He's hoping that Alice will see this as a sign that he's serious about getting the product and is willing to pay a fair price. By splitting the difference between his last offer and Alice's current one, Bob hopes to reach an agreement and secure the product for a price he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob wants to save as much money as possible, he has been negotiating for a while and Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget.  Continuing to negotiate might save a few more dollars, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and then Bob would have to buy from John for a significantly higher price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
