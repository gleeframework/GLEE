"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This would still be a fantastic deal for you, as the product is worth significantly more to you.  Let's try to find common ground!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
