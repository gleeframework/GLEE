"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the value to Bob ($150), leaving room for negotiation but ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Room for Compromise:** This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:** $125 is still above my minimum threshold of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob has shown interest and has indicated a willingness to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can potentially push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John immediately would lock in a profit, but I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $135. This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me too. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $130 is very close to my desired price point and well above my minimum threshold of $120.
* **Compromise:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, moving closer to my position.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject, I risk Bob walking away or another counteroffer that could potentially drop the price further.  
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, accepting now secures a good price."
