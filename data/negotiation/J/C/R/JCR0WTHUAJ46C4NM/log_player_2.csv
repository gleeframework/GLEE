"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and reasonable offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to let this product go for $700,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. I've already met you halfway, and I think it's time for you to meet me halfway too. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $825,000 secures a decent discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer."
