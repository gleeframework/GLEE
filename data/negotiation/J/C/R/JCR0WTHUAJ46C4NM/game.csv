"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and reasonable offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to let this product go for $700,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. I've already met you halfway, and I think it's time for you to meet me halfway too. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
