"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and meet at $95? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",105.0,Alice,5,
