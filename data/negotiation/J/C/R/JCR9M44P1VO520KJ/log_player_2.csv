Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go below $100, which is John's price.  Cut your losses and buy from John to secure the product at the best price."
