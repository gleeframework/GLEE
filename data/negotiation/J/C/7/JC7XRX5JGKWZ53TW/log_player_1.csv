"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my $150 goal, Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that the negotiation will drag on and I might end up getting less, or even having to sell to John for $150.  Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a decent profit."
