"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
