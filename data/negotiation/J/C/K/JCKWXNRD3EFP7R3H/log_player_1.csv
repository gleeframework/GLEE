"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth more than that to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one. Bob is clearly interested but hesitant to meet my price. While I could push for more, the difference between his offer and John's is getting smaller. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I believe I could potentially get more from Bob, the risk of him walking away and getting stuck with the product isn't worth the extra $1,000. John provides a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
