"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $1,200,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's still a significant profit for you.  Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
