"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it allows for some negotiation room while still being significantly higher than my minimum value of $120.  Let's see if Bob is willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to $150 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter with $145. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but it still gives me some margin to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $142 is getting very close to my initial price.  Considering I only have 6 rounds left, I think it's worth accepting this offer. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the remaining rounds."
