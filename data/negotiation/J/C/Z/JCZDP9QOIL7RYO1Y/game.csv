"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that the product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. This is a fair compromise that reflects both the product's worth and my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
