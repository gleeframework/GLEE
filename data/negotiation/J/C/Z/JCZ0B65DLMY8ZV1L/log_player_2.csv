"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the realm of reason, given that Bob's maximum budget is $800,000. This aggressive first counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation and signals to Alice that Bob is serious about finding a deal within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's comfortable range.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to his target. There's still room for a better deal, and buying from John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a strategic move to show Alice that Bob is serious about a deal but also not willing to overpay. The goal is to nudge Alice closer to Bob's desired price point without pushing her away from the negotiation table."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above Bob's comfortable range. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a price closer to his target. Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiations, and buying from John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer once more, but staying within his budget and demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to meet him halfway. If Alice rejects, Bob can either make another counteroffer or choose to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above Bob's comfortable range. He has 3 more rounds to negotiate, and there is potential to get a better deal. It's likely that Alice will continue to lower her price, especially considering she has rejected multiple counteroffers from Bob. There's still room for a better deal, and buying from John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but staying within his budget and demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to meet him halfway.  If Alice rejects, Bob has only two rounds left to make a deal before having to consider buying from John. This counteroffer is a last attempt to secure a deal within Bob's desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left and Alice's offer still being above Bob's budget, it's time to cut his losses and buy from John. While Alice's price is slightly lower than her previous offer, it's not enough of a decrease to warrant continuing negotiations. Buying from John guarantees a deal within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice in the final round."
