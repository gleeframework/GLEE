"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room for negotiation and gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth to him ($1,000,000).
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing like ""What do you think?""  keeps the conversation open and invites a counter-offer from Bob.

My strategy is to try and secure a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible while being mindful of the $800,000 offer from John as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. Would you consider $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've come down from my initial offer while still staying significantly above Bob's initial counter-offer. This signals a willingness to negotiate but also emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" helps create a more collaborative tone and might encourage Bob to meet me closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm leaving space for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still come down slightly in the next round while remaining above my $800,000 safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy.  However, $875,000 is still a significant distance from my target. I'll counter-offer again, aiming to close the gap more aggressively while remaining aware of the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping to $900,000, but I'm also setting a firm boundary with ""final offer."" This signals my seriousness while still leaving Bob with a potentially very appealing deal.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I want to encourage a decision.  
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and potentially sway Bob. 

I'm hoping this strategic move will prompt Bob to accept. If not, I'll need to carefully evaluate my options in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $875,000 again, as I believe it's a fair price for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob has not budged from his $875,000 offer despite my attempts to negotiate higher. This suggests his willingness to pay is likely capped around this amount.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away and the deal falling through increases. 
* **Acceptable Profit:**  While not ideal, $875,000 is still a substantial profit margin above my guaranteed offer from John.

It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing both Bob and John by holding out for an ideal price that may never come."
