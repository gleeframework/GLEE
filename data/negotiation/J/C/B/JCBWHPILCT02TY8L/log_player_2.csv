"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Considering its worth to you is $120, I'm proposing to sell it to you for $110. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, taking into account its high value to you. Don't miss out on this opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $120
* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **John's Price:** $120

Bob can get the product from John for $120, which is his maximum value. Alice's offer is only slightly better, but it's still above his target of saving money.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller."
