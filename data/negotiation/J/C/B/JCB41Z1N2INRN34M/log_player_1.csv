"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by saying ""Let me know what you think!"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, even if it takes more rounds of negotiation.
* **John is a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible while still protecting my interests.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the $10,000 price as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob."
