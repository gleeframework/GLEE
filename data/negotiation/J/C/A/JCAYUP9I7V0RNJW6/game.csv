"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're able to meet me halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,250. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept it, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10250.0,Bob,4,
