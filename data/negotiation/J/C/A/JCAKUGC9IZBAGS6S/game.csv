"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can we meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down a little more to $140, but that's my final offer. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $132?",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  I'm going to make one final offer of $138.  This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.  If you're not interested, I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",138.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I think $135 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet there and finalize the deal?",135.0,Bob,8,
