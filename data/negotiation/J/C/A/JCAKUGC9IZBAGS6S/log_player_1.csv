"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $120 is far too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can we meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I'm not ready to settle for $130. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $130 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down a little more to $140, but that's my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $132 is still too low, but I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers to ensure I don't lose too much money."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  I'm going to make one final offer of $138.  This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.  If you're not interested, I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer."", ""product_price"": 138}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I think $135 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet there and finalize the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  I've had a few rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while I'm close to a deal, I'm running out of time.  I'm confident I can secure a better price with John, so I'm going to go with that option."
