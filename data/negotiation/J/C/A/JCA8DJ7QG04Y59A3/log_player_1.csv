{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than the minimum you're willing to accept ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $790,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still lower than your ideal price.  You have the option to negotiate further, and there's a chance you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $820,000. This still allows for a good profit for me, while remaining within your budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 820000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I will consider your latest offer. However, I must respectfully decline and propose a counteroffer of $805,000. I believe this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $805,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's a good compromise, and you're likely to find it difficult to get a higher price from Bob at this point. Accepting his offer is the most financially sensible decision."
