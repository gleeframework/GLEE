"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is considerable. Let's meet in the middle; how about $1,900,000? This represents a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000.  This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our shared understanding of the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
