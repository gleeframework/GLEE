Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer of $2,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000.  This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering our shared understanding of the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.
