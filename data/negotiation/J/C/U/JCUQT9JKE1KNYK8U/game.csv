"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $1,050,000. This still allows me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost while saving you some money compared to your initial asking price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to counter your offer with $1,100,000. This price is higher than my previous offer but still below your initial asking price. I hope this proposal works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
