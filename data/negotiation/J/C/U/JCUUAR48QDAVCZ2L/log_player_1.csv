{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 is still significantly below your minimum and offers Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This offer balances your desire for maximum profit with a realistic chance of Bob accepting the deal."
