{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves Bob with the impression that he might be able to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $150. I've already made a counteroffer and Bob is unwilling to budge further. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, as that's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum price requirement."
