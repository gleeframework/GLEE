"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a decent chance Alice is willing to go lower, and I can potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 10% discount from Alice's initial price. This is aggressive but still within the range of what might be considered reasonable. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue to negotiate and adjust my counteroffer based on her responses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my initial counteroffer. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to potentially secure a better price. I believe Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she rejected my previous counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm willing to compromise. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, making it more likely she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the wrong direction, increasing the price again. While $900,000 is closer to my maximum, I still believe I can secure a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $800,000. This demonstrates that I'm not willing to go higher, and I hope this shows Alice that I am serious about this price.  If Alice rejects this again, I might start to consider buying from John as we are getting closer to his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to increase her price, and we are now at a point where John's offer is becoming more attractive.  I've already tried to negotiate and have reached a point where Alice is unwilling to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's not worth risking another round of negotiations with Alice, as it's likely she'll only increase the price again."
