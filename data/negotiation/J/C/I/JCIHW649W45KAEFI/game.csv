"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $7,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can meet you at $8,500, which is a bit of a compromise. This is my final offer on this price point, and I think it's a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
