Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It also leaves room for negotiation since it's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and to gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. It demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price. Further negotiation might result in a slightly better price, but the risk of him rejecting and possibly dropping out is too high. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit while minimizing risk."
