"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $800000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",750000.0,Alice,3,
