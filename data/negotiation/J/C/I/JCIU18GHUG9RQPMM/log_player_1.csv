Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a bit above Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for me.  It also provides a clear starting point for Bob to counter if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I need to be flexible, I can't accept a deal that significantly undervalues my product.  I will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but shows I am willing to negotiate further. It's a compromise, but I still expect to get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more acceptable price, it's still too low.  I will make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the gap further.  Selling to John would be the most financially beneficial, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, showing a willingness to compromise. This price is still above Bob's valuation but represents a significant step towards a potential agreement.  It's my final offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough for me.  At this point, I don't want to risk another round of negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price than what John is offering.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
