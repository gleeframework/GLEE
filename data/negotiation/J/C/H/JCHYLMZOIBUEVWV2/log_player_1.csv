"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition."" Even though you know Bob's valuation is lower, framing it this way might make him reconsider his assessment. 
* **Alternative:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly above Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that you're looking for a higher price while keeping the door open for Bob to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the product offers you significant value beyond $1,800,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a smaller concession ($100,000) than Bob's initial counteroffer, showing that we're willing to negotiate but are also firm on our valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We continue to highlight the ""significant value"" and ""potential benefits"" to nudge Bob towards his higher potential willingness to pay.
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** We're still aiming to stay above our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) with room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to our acceptable range, but his concessions are getting smaller. We need to slow down his momentum and show him we're not desperate.
* **Above Minimum:** We're still comfortably above our guaranteed sale price with John, so we have leverage to push back further.
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting this offer, we signal to Bob that we're serious about getting a price closer to our valuation, encouraging him to make a more significant jump in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  However, $1,700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,825,000. This offer reflects a substantial compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession, Firm Language:**  We're reducing our counteroffer by a smaller amount ($75,000) and using firmer language (""significantly undervalues,"" ""substantial compromise"") to signal that we're reaching the limit of our flexibility.
* **Midpoint Pressure:**  Offering $1,825,000 is a strategic move. It's slightly above the midpoint between his last offer ($1,700,000) and our previous ask ($1,900,000). This creates the impression of a ""fair"" compromise while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, reminding Bob of the ticking clock (limited rounds) might encourage him to make a more decisive move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,750,000 is a substantial profit above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks alienating Bob and could lead to him walking away entirely.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now, rather than risking further rounds, allows us to move on to other opportunities and avoids potential delays. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer outweighs the potential reward at this point."
