"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you at $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe the product offers you significant value beyond $1,800,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,700,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  However, $1,700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,825,000. This offer reflects a substantial compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
