"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that's still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product. This leaves room for negotiation, but also shows my confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating my confidence in the product's value."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher value. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise.  I'm confident that Bob is still motivated to buy the product, and this counteroffer should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price. I'll counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, so I need to find a balance between being firm on my price and not risking losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

This is a compromise offer, showing willingness to meet Bob halfway.  It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum and only slightly below Bob's offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is approaching my minimum, I'm still hopeful we can close a little higher.  I'll make one final counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $950,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range. It's a final attempt to close the deal at a price I'm comfortable with before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call. While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my ideal target. However, we're out of rounds, and I need to make a decision.  Since I'm still over my minimum price with John, selling to him ensures a safe and relatively profitable deal."
