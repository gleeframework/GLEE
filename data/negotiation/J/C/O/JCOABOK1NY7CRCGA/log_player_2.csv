You should reject Alice's offer.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is still too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your ideal. You can try to get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

Alice is getting closer to your price point, but you can still try to squeeze out a better deal.  $105 is still a bit more than you are comfortable with.  Keep negotiating!"
