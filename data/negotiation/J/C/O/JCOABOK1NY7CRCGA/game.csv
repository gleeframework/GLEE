"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $90? That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $95.  That's a good price for both of us, and it leaves room for you to make a profit. What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really close to being able to buy this from you, but I can't go any higher than $100.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can make this happen.  If not, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
