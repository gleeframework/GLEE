``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
