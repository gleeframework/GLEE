"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to counteroffer, knowing that John is willing to sell for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. There's still room to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially getting a better price or pushing Alice to a point where you'd be comfortable buying from her. Remember, you have John as a backup option if this negotiation fails."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,100,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, but this is still higher than your desired price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky.  It's likely that you'll need to offer closer to $1,100,000 to get a deal.  

At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the sure thing and buy from John for $1,000,000. You're guaranteed a good deal, and you avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock."
