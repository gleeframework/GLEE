{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$5,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $6,500.** This shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. 
* **It's still a decent price for you**, as you're willing to pay up to $12,000. 
* **This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.** If she's flexible, she might accept. If not, you can continue to adjust your counteroffer in subsequent rounds."

* **You have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush.** You can continue to see if you can get the price down further.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}

* **It's still within your budget**, as you're comfortable paying up to $12,000.
* **This counteroffer could potentially lead to an agreement.** If Alice is flexible, she might accept this offer. If not, you can adjust your offer in the next round based on her response."

* **You're getting closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room to negotiate.** You have several rounds remaining, so you don't need to rush into accepting.
* **Rejecting allows you to continue exploring if you can reach a better price.** You can adjust your counteroffer again, potentially bridging the gap between your desired price and hers."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $6,250 is getting closer to your desired price.** It's likely she's becoming more flexible, and we're approaching a potential agreement.
* **Offering $6,000 shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but still maintaining a lower price than her last offer.** This is a good strategy to show you're serious about buying while still keeping your budget in mind.
* **With 4 rounds remaining, there's still some room for negotiation.**  If Alice accepts, you've secured a good deal. If not, you can still adjust your offer in subsequent rounds."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $6,375 is only slightly higher than your last counteroffer of $6,000.** This shows she's becoming more flexible and may be willing to settle.
* **We're approaching the halfway point of your budget ($12,000) and her original offer ($6,500).** It's likely that further negotiation will lead to minimal savings, and it's better to secure the product at a reasonable price.
* **With only 3 rounds remaining, it's time to consider the risk of going to John.**  If you continue to reject, you might end up paying John $12,000, which is a significant difference from Alice's current offer.
* **Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with while minimizing the risk of further negotiations.**"
