"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal.  Since you have a backup option with John at $1,500,000, you hold a strong position to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
