"I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $8000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. How about we meet at $9500? This allows for a good deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit.  $8800 is still not quite there for me.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $9150.  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit and you to secure a great product at a reasonable price.",9150.0,Alice,5,
