"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,000 is too low for me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling point. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. How about we meet at $9,500? This allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm going to try to get a little closer to my target before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up a bit.  $8,800 is still not quite there for me.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $9,150.  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit and you to secure a great product at a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9150 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, I've been through several rounds and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is still below my initial asking price, it's a good compromise and closer to my target. I'm confident that John will still be available if I need to sell to him later, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
