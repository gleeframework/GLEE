"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but I need a price that works for me as well.  How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $800,000? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable compromise.",800000.0,Alice,3,
