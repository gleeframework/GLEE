"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum price of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if a more acceptable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $7000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to his maximum price, he's still willing to pay less. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. I'm really interested in this product, and this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $8500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. Let's try $9200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is still asking for more than Bob's maximum price.  While there's a chance that continued negotiations could lead to a lower price with Alice, it's a risk that Bob doesn't need to take.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
