"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12000 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm now offering it to you for $13500. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob! However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $14000. I'm willing to throw in a premium service package worth $1000, which includes expedited delivery and dedicated support. This brings the total value to $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,
