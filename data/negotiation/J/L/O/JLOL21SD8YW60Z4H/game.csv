"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to $8,400. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal.",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $7,800.  This is a fair price that considers both our positions.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,800 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to $8,200. It's getting close to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value of the product.",8200.0,Alice,7,
