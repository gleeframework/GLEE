Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit. If Bob rejects, I'm ready to counter or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial asking price, and it's still above my minimum. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
