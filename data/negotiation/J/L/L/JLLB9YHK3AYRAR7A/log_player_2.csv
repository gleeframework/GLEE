"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11500. This takes into account the value you place on the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a good price and closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Bob is trying to maximize his savings and believes further negotiation can potentially bring the price down even further. He wants to stick with his goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This feels like a fair balance, considering the product's value and our desire to find a good solution.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is a reasonable price, Bob has reached a point where he's determined to stick to his initial goal of getting the product for no more than $10,000.  Further negotiation might result in a better price, but it's also likely to be time-consuming and risky.  At this point, buying from John for $10,000 provides a guaranteed solution and ensures that Bob achieves his objective of saving the most money."
