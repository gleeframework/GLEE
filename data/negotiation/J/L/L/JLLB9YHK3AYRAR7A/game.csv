"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11500. This takes into account the value you place on the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.  This seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $11000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $11250.  This feels like a fair balance, considering the product's value and our desire to find a good solution.  Let's make this happen.",11250.0,Alice,5,
