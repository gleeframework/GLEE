Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Secure a Quick Sale:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale to John encourages Bob to act fast, potentially avoiding the need for further negotiation."
