Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This is a starting point that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By starting at $1,100,000, I create an opening for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for myself. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $1,200,000 offer, as Bob is willing to pay at least $1,000,000.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $950,000 is still a good price, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for negotiation in the next round. I believe I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I believe I can potentially get closer to that by continuing negotiations with Bob. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to set a new price point and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial proposal, indicating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's offer while emphasizing the product's value and the potential for a positive outcome. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer creates a more realistic range for negotiation. It's likely that Bob will be willing to pay more than $950,000, but I'm also not willing to go below $1,000,000.  By offering $1,050,000, I aim to create a scenario where both of us feel we're getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're making progress. I would like to counter with an offer of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me and I hope it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. This outcome meets my goal of getting a price that is at least $1,000,000. 

**Strategy:**

While I could potentially try to negotiate further and push for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John for $1,200,000 is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of losing out on a potential sale."
