,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $90? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $98. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
