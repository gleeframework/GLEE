Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Letting Bob know about other potential buyers (""John"" is implied) might encourage him to act quickly.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to his maximum."
