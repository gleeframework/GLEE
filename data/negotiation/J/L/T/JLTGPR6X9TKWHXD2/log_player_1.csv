"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below what the product is worth to Bob, aiming to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
