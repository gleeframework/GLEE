Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, as I know Bob is willing to pay at least $12,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $13,000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price? I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from him.  It's also the same price I can get from John, so there's no real advantage to continuing to negotiate."
