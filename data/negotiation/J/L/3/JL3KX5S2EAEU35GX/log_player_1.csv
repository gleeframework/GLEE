I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $650,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $725,000 is closer, it's still significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can bridge the gap."
