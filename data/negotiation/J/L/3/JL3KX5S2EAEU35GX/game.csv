"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value I know you'll get out of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something around $725,000. Would you be open to that?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $787,500.  This price is fair to both of us and allows for a profitable transaction.  What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
