"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be profitable for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since our maximum budget is significantly lower."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. This tactic might encourage Alice to move closer to our desired range.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time and clearly states our position without being overly aggressive. 
* **Justification:** While not essential, hinting at budget constraints can sometimes make a counteroffer more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value I know you'll get out of the product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  Alice made a significant move down from $1,000,000 to $850,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still higher than our maximum budget and our fallback option with John. 
* **Room for negotiation:** It's worth seeing if we can get Alice a bit closer to the $800,000 mark. There's a chance she might be willing to make a smaller concession to close the deal."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something around $725,000. Would you be open to that?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price, but still holding firm below our absolute limit. Aiming for the middle ground between her last offer and ours shows willingness to compromise.
* **Specific Target:** Giving a precise number ($725,000) instead of a range can sometimes be more effective in negotiations. It provides a clear target for Alice. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  The phrasing ""Would you be open to that?"" keeps the conversation going and invites Alice to make a counter-proposal instead of simply saying ""yes"" or ""no."""
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $787,500.  This price is fair to both of us and allows for a profitable transaction.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Difference:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her latest offer of $787,500 is only slightly lower than John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiation with Alice might not yield a significant price reduction, and there's a risk of reaching an impasse. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John's offer provides a guaranteed purchase at a price very close to Alice's current offer. It makes more sense to take the sure thing and avoid potential further negotiation hassle."
