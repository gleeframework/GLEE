"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $10,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly more to $11,000, my final offer. This is a very fair price considering its worth.",11000.0,Alice,5,
