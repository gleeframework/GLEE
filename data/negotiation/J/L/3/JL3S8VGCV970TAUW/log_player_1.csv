Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Setting the price at $1,350,000 allows us to capture a significant portion of that value while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($150,000).
* **Urgency:** The message includes a time constraint (""limited-time offer"") to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price of $1,000,000. This knowledge empowers us to aim higher with Bob."
