""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still keeping the price significantly above your $800,000 minimum.
* **Strong but Respectful:** The language is confident in the product's value without being overly aggressive. 

This offer aims to secure a deal with Bob, maximizing your profit. If he rejects this initial offer, there's still a possibility to negotiate further or accept John's guaranteed offer."
