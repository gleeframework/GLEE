I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, but if he's not, I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$9,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell it for that. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,500 is a decent offer and is above my minimum threshold.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower price if I counteroffer again and he refuses."
