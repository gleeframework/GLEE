"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do like the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,300,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is better, I'm still hoping to land closer to my budget. Would you be willing to do $1,200,000? That would be a good point for both of us, I think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
