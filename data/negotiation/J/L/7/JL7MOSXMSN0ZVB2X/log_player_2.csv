"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,300,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
