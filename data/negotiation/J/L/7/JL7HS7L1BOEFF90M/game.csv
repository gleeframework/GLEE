"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with the return on investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. I'm willing to increase my offer some, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but need to stay above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
