"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on $750,000. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $825,000. This would still allow me to make a good profit while giving you a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you one last time at $800,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. If you're still interested, let's finalize this agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
