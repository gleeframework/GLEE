Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $115. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'm also starting to run out of rounds, so I need to be careful about not giving up too much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. Let's split the difference - how about $111? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 111}
