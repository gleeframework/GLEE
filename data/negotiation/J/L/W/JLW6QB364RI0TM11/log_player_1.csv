Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer allows me to maximize my potential profit while still being competitive for Bob.  

Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $9,000 is more than $8,000, giving Bob a good incentive to consider buying.
* **It's lower than my guaranteed value:**  By selling to John, I'm assured of $10,000. This offer leaves me with $1,000 less, but I'm still getting a good deal.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob may counter-offer, giving us a chance to find a price that works for both of us. 

This approach balances the need for a profitable sale with the possibility of a better outcome through negotiation."
