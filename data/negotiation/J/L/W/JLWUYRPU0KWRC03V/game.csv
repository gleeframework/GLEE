"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $8,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. I think this is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate that you've come down, but $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $8,850? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8850.0,Bob,6,
