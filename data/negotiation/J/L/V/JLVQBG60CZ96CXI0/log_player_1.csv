Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** I'm still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can go down a bit if Bob counters. 
* **It's attractive to Bob:** He knows the product is worth more to him, so he has an incentive to accept.

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating.  If not, I'll sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I can still potentially get more from Bob through negotiation.  

**Here's my reasoning:**

* **My goal is to maximize profit:** I want to get as close to $12,000 as possible.  
* **I have leverage:** Bob knows he wants the product and has already indicated his willingness to pay more than $10,000. 
* **I can counteroffer:** I can try to get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer.  If he rejects, I'll re-evaluate whether it's worth continuing to negotiate or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground while still maximizing my profit.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I want to keep the negotiation amicable and show Bob I'm willing to work with him. 
* **Focus on the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to incentivize him to accept. 

If Bob still rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing or selling to John."
