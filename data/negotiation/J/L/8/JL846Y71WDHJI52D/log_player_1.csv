"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price that is close to Bob's perceived value, but still gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:**  I emphasize the value of the product and frame the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question to keep the conversation open and allow for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $80, I believe I can achieve a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $70 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $85? I'm confident you'll agree this is still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing that $85 is a ""great deal"" for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I keep the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $80? That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair compromise:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gain:**  I'm unlikely to get a higher price from Bob, and there's a risk he could reject any further counteroffers.
* **Equal opportunity:**  Selling to John also offers $80, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the deal in this round."
