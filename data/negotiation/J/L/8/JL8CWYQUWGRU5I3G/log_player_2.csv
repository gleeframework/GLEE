"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still too high.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price. It's too early in the negotiation to buy from John, as there's a good chance of getting a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and aims to establish a starting point for further bargaining.  It is well below his maximum price of $1,200,000, leaving room for a compromise. This is a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal.  Bob should reject the offer.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer.  There's no reason to buy from John at this point, as Bob is making progress with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal.  It's a reasonable midpoint between their previous offers, making it more likely for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  $825,000 is a good price, and Alice is likely getting closer to her bottom line.  There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  If Bob rejects this offer and then Alice rejects his counteroffer, he might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
