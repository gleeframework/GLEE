"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial expectation. Considering its potential value, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. Considering its worth to me is at least $1000000, I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still lower than my ideal price, but it's getting closer. I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, and there's potential to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further concessions from Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm still hesitant.  I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's very close to my upper limit.  I'm confident that this price will be mutually beneficial, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975000. Considering its worth to me is at least $1000000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still slightly higher than my previous counteroffer of $975,000. I'm still hopeful that I can convince her to go lower, or at least meet me in the middle.  I have 5 rounds left, and I'm not desperate enough to accept a price that's not ideal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal quickly.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer again, and it's now getting closer to my preferred price range.  We're only on round 7, and with 3 rounds remaining, I need to start considering the potential cost of further negotiations.  If I reject this offer, I risk Alice becoming less willing to compromise, and I might end up paying more or even losing the deal altogether.  Furthermore, if I keep rejecting offers and eventually buy from John, I'll end up paying $1,200,000, which is much higher than the current offer. Accepting this offer guarantees me the product for a price that's still within my budget and provides a good deal overall."
