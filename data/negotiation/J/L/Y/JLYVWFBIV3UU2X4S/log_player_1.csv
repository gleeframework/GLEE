Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, I'm offering it to him at that price. This ensures I get the maximum value for the product while still being likely to get Bob to accept the offer.  If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for the same amount."
