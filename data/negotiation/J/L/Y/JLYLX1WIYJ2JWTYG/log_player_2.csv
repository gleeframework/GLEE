Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1050000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my potential profit.  I believe this offer reflects the value of the product for both of us.
