"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
