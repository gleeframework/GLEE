"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  This gives us room to work towards a price that works for both of us, hopefully closer to my $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is too low for me. I can't go below $180 for this product. It's high quality and worth the price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down slightly, but $180 is still way above my budget. I'll reject and try to meet her somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product is high quality, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying well below her asking price. $100 feels like a good middle ground at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine? Would you be willing to pay $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I want to spend.  Splitting the difference again might get me close to my $120 limit. I'll try one more counter-offer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $120? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm sticking to my maximum budget with this offer. This puts the ball in Alice's court and lets her decide if she's willing to sell for my final price."
