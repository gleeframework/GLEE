"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is close to my limit, but there's room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation while staying above Alice's valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  While $130 is better, I'm willing to see if I can get it lower, even if it means meeting in the middle eventually."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $120? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counter offer aims to:

* **Appear reasonable:** By suggesting splitting the difference, it comes across as a fair compromise.
* **Hit Alice's valuation:** $120 is the price Alice values the product at. While she'd ideally like to sell higher, this ensures she doesn't lose money on the deal and might be enough to entice her.
* **Avoid going to John:** While $130 isn't bad, securing the deal now at $120 is the best outcome if possible."
