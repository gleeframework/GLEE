Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to get even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $115 is a price that allows me to potentially profit more than selling to John while still being attractive to Bob (since it's more than his perceived value of $100). 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning I'll list it publicly, I subtly encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
