"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $115 is slightly better than John's $100, you know you can get it for the lower price. There's no harm in rejecting her offer and buying from John."
