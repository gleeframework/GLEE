"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer is fair, considering the product's value, and gives us both a good deal. Let's settle this now.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
