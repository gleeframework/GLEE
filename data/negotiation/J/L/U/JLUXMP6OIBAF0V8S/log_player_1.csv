Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe you'll find valuable. I think a fair price would be $145. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message is framed in a way that is not overly aggressive and invites Bob to engage in a friendly negotiation."
