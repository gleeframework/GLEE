"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and opens the door for a mutually beneficial deal.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start the negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your initial offer, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To move forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this adjustment reflects a more realistic valuation and keeps us on track for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Considering the product's potential and the value it brings, I'm proposing a price of $1,650,000. This feels like a fair deal that recognizes its worth while still offering you a great opportunity.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting there.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $1,350,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident in the product's potential.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  We're definitely in the ballpark now. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,475,000.  This feels like a strong offer that reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment. What do you say?",1475000.0,Alice,7,
