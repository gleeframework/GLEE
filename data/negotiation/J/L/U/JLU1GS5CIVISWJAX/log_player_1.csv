(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum price.  Bob seems willing to negotiate, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum price that it's worth accepting. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price."
