Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $132?"", ""product_price"": 132}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with that price. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $128 is still a profit above my minimum. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing him entirely."
