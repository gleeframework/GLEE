"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  This is my absolute maximum, so let me know if you're willing to consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm stuck at my initial offer of $800000.  If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll have to look elsewhere. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
