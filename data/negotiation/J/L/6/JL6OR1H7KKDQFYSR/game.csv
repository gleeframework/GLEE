"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $85. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
