"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity!  This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you.  To start, I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This gives us both room to negotiate, and I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $862,500. This offer reflects a compromise on both our sides and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500

Alice is consistently meeting in the middle. While we could likely negotiate a bit lower, the difference is getting small enough that it's probably not worth the risk of Alice walking away or the additional time spent negotiating."
