"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity!  This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds the same value for you.  To start, I'd like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This gives us both room to negotiate, and I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable,  that price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $750,000. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $825,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $862,500. This offer reflects a compromise on both our sides and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,5,
