Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**The Strategy**

You want to offer a price that is appealing to Bob (above his valuation) but still maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This offer is significantly above Bob's valuation but well below your guaranteed price. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting ""unique value"" and ""significant returns,"" you aim to justify the high price without directly revealing your minimum.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Outcome**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a great profit of $1,400,000.
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly downward, but always keep your $1,500,000 safety net in mind."
