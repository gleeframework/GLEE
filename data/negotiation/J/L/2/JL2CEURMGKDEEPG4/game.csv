"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not able to go below $105. It's a significant discount from my original price, and it's the best I can do.  If you're truly interested, I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price.",105.0,Alice,5,
