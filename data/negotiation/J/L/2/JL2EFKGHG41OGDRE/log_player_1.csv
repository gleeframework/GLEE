"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open for discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum as possible.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still lower than my initial offer. I want to signal to Bob that I'm serious about selling, but not desperate to accept his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $17,000 to $14,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the benefit of the deal for Bob by reminding him he'd still be getting a good deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** $14,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose too much money.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob. If he rejects it again, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,000 is still a bit much for my budget. Could you do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We are only in round 4 out of 10, so I have time to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to show Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also determined to get a price that's fair for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $13,500. This is a significant step towards your offer, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500. This demonstrates my willingness to find a solution.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $13,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I get a decent price. 
* **Framing it as a compromise:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant step towards Bob's offer, hoping to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $12,500? I'm willing to be flexible, but that's really the most I can justify spending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even with the slight increase to $12,500, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 6 out of 10, and I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate and potentially losing out on a better deal with John.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids any further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a better price,  time is running out, and John provides a reliable and immediate solution.  I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed profit with John rather than risk a lower price with Bob."
