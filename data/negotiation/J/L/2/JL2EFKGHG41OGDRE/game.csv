"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $14,000 is still a bit much for my budget. Could you do $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $13,500. This is a significant step towards your offer, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum price.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $12,500? I'm willing to be flexible, but that's really the most I can justify spending.",12500.0,Bob,6,
