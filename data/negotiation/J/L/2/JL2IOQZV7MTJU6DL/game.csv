"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,750 is closer to my budget, I still feel that $10,000 would be a more reasonable price for both of us. Would you be open to discussing this further?",10000.0,Bob,4,
