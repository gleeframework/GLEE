"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You can likely get a better deal than $1,150,000, as Alice values the product at $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:

You're still a bit higher than you want to be, but you're closer to your target price of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get Alice to come down a bit more."
