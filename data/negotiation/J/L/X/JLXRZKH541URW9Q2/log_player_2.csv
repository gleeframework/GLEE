# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's say $900,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty.  While $800,000 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept it on the condition that you [insert a small, mutually beneficial add-on here, like a referral, testimonial, or future collaboration opportunity].  It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the ideal outcome! You've reached your maximum price and potentially gained a small additional benefit.  There's no reason to risk losing the deal at this point."
