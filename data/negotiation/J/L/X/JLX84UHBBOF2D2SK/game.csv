"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a good price for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1050000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. Considering the value the product brings to you, I'm willing to go up to $1050000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
