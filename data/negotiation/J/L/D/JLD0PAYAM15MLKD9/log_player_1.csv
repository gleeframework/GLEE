Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1150000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Considering the market value and my budget, I'm prepared to offer $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
