"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. This is the maximum value I'm willing to accept, and it's what John is willing to pay. While Bob values the product lower, there's a chance he might be willing to meet my price in hopes of securing the deal.  If he rejects, we can start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering a price of $900,000, which is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still holding out for a price that's closer to what the product is worth to me. I hope this will encourage Bob to come up in his offer, or at least continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price.  It's possible Bob might be willing to go up again, or I might be able to push him further with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000.  This is a significant move, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. He's already shown a willingness to increase his offer, and we're getting closer to a point where we can both be happy with the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still not convinced that I can't get a better price.  We've only got four rounds left, so I'm taking a gamble and hoping that I can get Bob to move a little higher with my next counteroffer.  If he rejects, though, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm going to try a smaller increment this time, offering $925,000.  Bob seems to be increasing his offers by $25,000 each time, so I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to find a compromise that will work for both of us."
