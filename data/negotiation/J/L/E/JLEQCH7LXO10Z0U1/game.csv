"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has immense potential for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1500000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and agree on $1350000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you meet me at that price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
