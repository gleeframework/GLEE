Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys at your minimum.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know John exists or your minimum selling price. You want to leverage this.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave Bob with a perceived benefit.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation makes him more likely to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Works**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,400,000 sets a strong initial point and leaves room for potential negotiation (though you should be hesitant to go much lower).
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant returns,"" subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Exclusivity:**  Using terms like ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of scarcity and desirability. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could test different strategies and offers to see what works best in similar negotiation scenarios."
