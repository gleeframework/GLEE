"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $10,250. It's a fair compromise that's closer to my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. How about we meet you halfway again, at $10,500? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,5,
