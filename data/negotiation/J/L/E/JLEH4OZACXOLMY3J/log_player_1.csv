Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a fair price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  It gives you room to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum:**  It still leaves you with a profit.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value of $120, it's still below my minimum of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob.  A counteroffer might lead to a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $132.50 is still higher than my desired minimum of $150.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  If Bob still wants to negotiate, we have some room to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $132.50 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $130 is lower than my ideal, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I continue to reject Bob's offers, there's a chance that John might decide to purchase from someone else.  It's important to secure a sale before losing a sure thing.

While it would be nice to get a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on both potential buyers."
