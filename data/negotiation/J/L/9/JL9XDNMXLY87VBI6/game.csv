"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a fair starting point, I'm unable to accept that offer at this time.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,300,000, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a deal.  This offer is still significantly beneficial to you, given the product's value to your business.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
