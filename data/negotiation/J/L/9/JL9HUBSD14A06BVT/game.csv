"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, my budget is more limited. I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go at this point. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
