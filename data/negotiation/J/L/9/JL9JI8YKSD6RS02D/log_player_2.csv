"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than $12,000 (Alice's value),  Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring if Alice will come down closer to Bob's $10,000 limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While I think the product is great,  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make this product work for my needs."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. How about we settle on $10,800? It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he's only $300 away from getting the product for his ideal price from John.  It's worth seeing if a final counter-offer can get Alice down to $10,000.  Even if it doesn't, Bob has a fallback option that is only slightly more expensive."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,600? It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still $600 more than what John is offering.  Since Bob has a reliable alternative with John, there's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice.  It's time to secure the product from John and save the $600."
