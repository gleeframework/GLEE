Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for cheap!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled about Bob's lowball offer, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $135. This is still a good deal for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this price is more appealing to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is very close. It's more than what John is offering and less risky than continuing to negotiate. I'll accept it and sell the product to Bob."
