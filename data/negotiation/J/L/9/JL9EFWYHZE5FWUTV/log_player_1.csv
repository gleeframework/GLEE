Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving me room to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than my initial offer, but it also allows me to earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price and also allows me to end the negotiation and avoid further rounds."
