# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still more expensive than buying from John. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. This might lead Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer, getting you closer to your goal of saving money. If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on purchasing from John for $1,000,000."
