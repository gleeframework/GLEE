"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130? I'm confident you'll still get great value for your money.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $130 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I would like to try to reach an agreement that is even more aligned with my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
