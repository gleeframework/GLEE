Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what it costs us, which is $12,000. However, considering your assessment of its worth at $8,000, I am willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How about we start at $10,000? This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm only willing to go as high as $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to make a deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
