"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth more than what it costs us, which is $12,000. However, considering your assessment of its worth at $8,000, I am willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How about we start at $10,000? This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
