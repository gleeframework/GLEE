Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're getting into a good price range. Accepting at $10,700 secures a reasonable deal.  Holding out for $10,500 carries the risk of Alice walking away, forcing us to buy from John at $15,000."
