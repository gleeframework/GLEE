"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and your potential profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This price is still within your desired profit range and allows me to stay within budget.  Let's make this deal work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,325,000? This price is fair and allows us both to close this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
