# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and save $2,500."
