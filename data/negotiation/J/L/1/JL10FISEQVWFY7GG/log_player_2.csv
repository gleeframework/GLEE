Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875

```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While I'm close to accepting, $10,875 is still a bit above my budget. Let's try $10,800. It's a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal without hurting either of us."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you!  $10,800 is a fair compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $10,850 to meet you halfway.  This is my final offer, as I want to close this deal. Let me know if you're on board! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price of $10,000. While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, it's getting risky. With only a few rounds left, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his target price and avoids further negotiation."
