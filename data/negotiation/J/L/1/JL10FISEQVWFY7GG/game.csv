,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think!",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While I'm close to accepting, $10,875 is still a bit above my budget. Let's try $10,800. It's a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal without hurting either of us.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you!  $10,800 is a fair compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $10,850 to meet you halfway.  This is my final offer, as I want to close this deal. Let me know if you're on board!",10850.0,Alice,7,
