"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $880,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $880,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll keep negotiating for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $880,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we finalize the deal at $890,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $890,000 is getting very close to my minimum price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
