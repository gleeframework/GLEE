{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can work out a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response.

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You'll need to be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your desire to either close the deal quickly or get the highest possible price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to keep my costs down. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $1,125,000 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum value and a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and energy, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but at this point, the potential gains from negotiating further are minimal."
