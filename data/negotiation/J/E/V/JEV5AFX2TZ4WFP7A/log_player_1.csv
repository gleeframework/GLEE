Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
