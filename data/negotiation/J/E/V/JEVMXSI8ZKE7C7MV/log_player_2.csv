# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,500,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a beautiful product you have there, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000.  It's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
