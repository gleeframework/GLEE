"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway – let's agree on $2,050,000, and we'll have a deal.",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  I need you to understand that this offer is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, reflecting my desire to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my absolute best. This is a rare opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  Let me be completely transparent – I have another interested buyer who sees the full value in this product.
