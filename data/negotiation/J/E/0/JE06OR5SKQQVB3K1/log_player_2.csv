# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring to your specific needs. What are your thoughts?
