Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar items, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire this unique item while ensuring you receive a reasonable return.  Let's work together to make this happen.
