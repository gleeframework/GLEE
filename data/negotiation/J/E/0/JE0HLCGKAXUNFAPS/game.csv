"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar items, I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire this unique item while ensuring you receive a reasonable return.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its rarity and value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1200000. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1300000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable and reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
