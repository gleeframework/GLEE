# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its rarity and value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's counteroffer is still too high. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You still have a backup option to buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1200000. Considering the product's value and my initial offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1300000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable and reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase from John."
