{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much more! Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $1,500,000 offer, but I also want to make sure Bob feels like he's getting a good deal.  I'll be ready to counter his offer if he rejects this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I believe I can get closer to my target price by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's too low for me. I understand your perspective but I need to get closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,050,000.50. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial target, it's very close to it, and accepting it would be a win for me.  I'm also concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk driving him away, potentially leading to me having to sell to John for less than I'd like. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer."
