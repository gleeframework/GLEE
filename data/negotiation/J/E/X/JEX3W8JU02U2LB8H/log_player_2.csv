"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. I think this is a great price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is still making a profit, and you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
