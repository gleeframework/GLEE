"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would greatly benefit you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. You can do better by rejecting and seeing if Alice will counter with a lower price or going with John."
