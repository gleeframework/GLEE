Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's being ripped off.  This strategy allows for a potential middle ground and avoids an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $100 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, giving me the opportunity to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a little closer to my original asking price.  How about $112?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110.50? It's still a good deal for me and gives you a bit more profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and further negotiation may risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to accept his offer and secure a good profit."
