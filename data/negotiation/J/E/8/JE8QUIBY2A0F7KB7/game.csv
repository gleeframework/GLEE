"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Would you be open to discussing that?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers and pay $8,625. Let's close this deal!",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,625. I'm willing to make a slightly smaller concession and offer the product to you for $8,700. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,700 is still a bit above my limit.  Let's split the difference and agree on $8,650. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to close this deal.",8650.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,650. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $8,675. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",8675.0,Alice,7,
