"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are dancing around the same number. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875, and we can both walk away happy?",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $10,875 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,062.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal.",11062.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $11,062 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we make it a clean $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,8,
