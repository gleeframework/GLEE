"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at her initial price.  You can do better by negotiating or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $12,000.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to your value, but you can still do better. It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is what I would pay John for the product.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I think it's worth more than that, and I'm willing to stand firm on my price. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum price, but it's still slightly higher than what you're willing to pay. Given you have the option to buy from John for your maximum price, it's the safest bet to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
