"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $12,000.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is what I would pay John for the product.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I think it's worth more than that, and I'm willing to stand firm on my price. I'm willing to offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. It's a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10200.0,Alice,5,
