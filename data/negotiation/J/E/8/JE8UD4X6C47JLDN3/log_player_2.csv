"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer like $80 gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $100 budget.  There's a chance Alice might accept a low offer, especially since it's still early in the negotiation. Even if she rejects it, it gives us an idea of her acceptable price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is way below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $125 is still above our budget.  We have room to negotiate, so we'll reject and propose a counteroffer closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. Could we settle at $95? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer! By offering $95, we're staying firm within our budget while still showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate upwards. This price point also gives us a little wiggle room if she comes back with another counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there at $95. I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's as low as I can go.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is signaling that $110 is her final offer. While this is closer to our budget, it's still more than we want to spend.  We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings at this point rather than risk Alice walking away and potentially not getting the product at all."
