"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is way below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I have a strict budget. Could we settle at $95? That's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $95. I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's as low as I can go.  If we can't agree on that, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",110.0,Alice,5,
