"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I've got to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Can you consider that?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $117.50?  It seems like we're getting close.",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $125, but I think we can do better than that. How about we try $128? It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me.",128.0,Alice,7,
