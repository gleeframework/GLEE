"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum price, I'm willing to try to negotiate a higher price. I believe the product is worth more than $12,000, and I have 9 rounds to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $13,500? It's a good compromise and gives you a great value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $13,000, which is closer to my desired price.  While I could potentially try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000.  Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and avoids further uncertainty."
