"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to kick off the negotiations. Given its value, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is too high.  It's worth exploring if Bob can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating a lower price.  $950,000 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,050,000? This price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above what Bob is aiming for.  There's room for further negotiation to find a price that's more favorable for Bob. It's important to keep exploring options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily decreasing the offer price, showing his commitment to a lower price. This counteroffer is still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, but it's closer to Alice's valuation. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible."
