{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I know you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates a sense of urgency and a slight ""discount"" feel.  
* **Alternative Guarantee:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
