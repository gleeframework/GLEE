"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 isn't quite enough for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $17000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15500?  This would give me a fair profit and allow you to get the product you want. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
