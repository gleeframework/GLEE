"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it leaves room for profit for both parties. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to the value I believe the product is worth to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm proposing $11,000 as a fair compromise. This price still allows you to make a good profit, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value I believe the product is worth to me.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,900, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, let's close this deal! ",10900.0,Alice,5,
