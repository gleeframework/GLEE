"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $9000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if we can agree on this.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great deal for you, considering the value I know the product holds. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",9500.0,Alice,5,
