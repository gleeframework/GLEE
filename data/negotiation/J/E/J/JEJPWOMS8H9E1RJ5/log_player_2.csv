"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $12000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a better price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get it closer to his $8,000 target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $9,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great deal for you, considering the value I know the product holds. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above his budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  While it's possible that Alice might come down further, there's no guarantee, and Bob has a better option available."
