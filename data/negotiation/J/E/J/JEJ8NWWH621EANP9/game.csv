"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable selling it for $65. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",75.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle at $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $70. How about we try $72? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise.",72.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you be open to $71?",71.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to sell for. How about we try $73? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise.",73.0,Alice,7,
