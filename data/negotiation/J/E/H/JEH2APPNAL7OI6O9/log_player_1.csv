Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a common ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is within my minimum threshold of $10,000. It's a reasonable compromise and I'm confident I can find another buyer if this deal falls through. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing out on a potential buyer and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
