Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I've carefully considered its worth and, given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification of value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, framing the high price as justified by the benefits it offers Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and inquisitive (""What do you think?""), signaling a willingness to discuss the price further and potentially negotiate a deal closer to $1,500,000 if needed. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid Bob immediately rejecting it and forcing us to go with John."
