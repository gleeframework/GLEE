Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, as I could get that from John.
* **I have 8 rounds left.**  There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 4

Round 6

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** While he seems committed to closing the deal, I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **I have 4 rounds left.** With a few rounds left, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.
