"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $12,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your minimum, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm sticking to $11,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I'm confident you'll get good value from it. What do you say?",11800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to $11,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $11,600. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a final push to close the deal.",11600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $11,600 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $11,700. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it. Let's close this deal!",11700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'll try to make one more push, so I'll offer $11,650. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",11650.0,Bob,8,
