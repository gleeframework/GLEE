Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $14,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer at $13,750. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still ensures I get a price closer to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offers are getting very close to my minimum, but not quite there.  Given that I can sell to John for $15,000, I'm going to take that option. It's the most profitable option at this point in the negotiation."
