"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1200000 to you.  Let's start our negotiation with a strong foundation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and you should aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, reflecting its worth to you. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1050000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high.  There's still room to negotiate further, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $1,075,000.  This price is fair considering your value and my budget, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your ongoing negotiation. While $1075000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, it still falls short of the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1090000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints and allows me to still make a fair profit. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now come down to $1,090,000, which is only $90,000 over your target price of $1,000,000. Given that there are only 5 rounds left, it's not likely you'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer secures the product while staying within your budget."
