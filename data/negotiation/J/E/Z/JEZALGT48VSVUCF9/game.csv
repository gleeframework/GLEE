"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1200000 to you.  Let's start our negotiation with a strong foundation.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it, reflecting its worth to you. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1050000 is a good offer, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $1075000.  This price is fair considering your value and my budget, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your ongoing negotiation. While $1075000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, it still falls short of the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $1090000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints and allows me to still make a fair profit. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
