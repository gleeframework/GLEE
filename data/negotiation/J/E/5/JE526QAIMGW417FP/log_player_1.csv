"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $175. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'd like to propose a price of $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's best to take it and secure the sale.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in subsequent rounds, and I risk losing time and potentially losing out to John."
