"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and fits within my financial constraints. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a substantial discount from my original price and reflects your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would be a significant gain for you, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. However, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I need. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but it also allows us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. Let's meet halfway.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us. It's a fair price that allows for a good profit for you, and it fits within my financial constraints. This is my final offer, if it's not acceptable, I will have to purchase the product from John.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
