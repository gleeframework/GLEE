Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum ($1,500,000) and your initial asking price. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about the product's value and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value goes beyond that. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By decreasing your price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The decrease is significant, showing Bob you're serious about making a deal, but you're still well above both his offer and your minimum.
* **Maintain Value:** The language emphasizes the product's inherent value, justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's try $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob's latest offer of $1,450,000 is still below your absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of further price reductions and wasted time, with no guarantee of a better offer. 

It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
