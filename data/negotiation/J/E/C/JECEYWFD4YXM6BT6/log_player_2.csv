"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Even though Alice is asking for more than her product is worth to her, it's still $300,000 less than what John is asking. 
* **You're still saving money:** You are getting the product for $1,200,000, which is below your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
