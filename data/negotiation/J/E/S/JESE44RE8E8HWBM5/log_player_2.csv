"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $14,500. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $13,500 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation, and it allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's previous offer. However, it's still below Bob's maximum price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down further.  He can aim for a price closer to $13,500 or even slightly lower.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $13,500, showing he's willing to compromise, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. This demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product and is willing to pay a fair price, but he also wants to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but they are still too high. While Bob could continue negotiating, the possibility of a deal at a price below $14,850 seems slim. Given that John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, it is in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John. This ensures that Bob acquires the product while minimizing his cost. Continuing to negotiate with Alice would likely result in a higher price and a longer negotiation process, potentially leading to a more expensive outcome for Bob."
