"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though you'd like to pay less, $125 is still cheaper than John's $150 price.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer in the future.**  You haven't been told that Alice's offer is a ""one-time offer"" for any specific reason, so you might not get a better deal elsewhere."
