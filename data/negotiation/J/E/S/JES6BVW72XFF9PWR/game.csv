"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,290,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
