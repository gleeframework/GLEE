Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for some back-and-forth negotiation without immediately reaching my minimum.
* **Focusing on Value:**  My message emphasizes the product's value to make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of getting a good price while also leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I also have John as a backup buyer at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to even consider. 

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation, especially since I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay my full asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still well above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a price that's fair for me. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message reminds Bob that the product is valuable, making him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price. This keeps the door open for further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired price while also making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. I'm confident that this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,750 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.  

I'll continue the negotiation and counter with a price closer to my desired price, but I'm not afraid to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable deal. I have a buyer (John) who is willing to pay my full asking price, so I don't need to rush into a sale that's not in my best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $7,750 is still a bit low for me, though. Let's try $8,250. That's a good middle ground, and I think it reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale.  
* **Compromising Again:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my previous counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise without giving up too much ground.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I frame the new price as ""good middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Reaffirming Value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by saying ""it reflects the value of the product.""

This counteroffer continues to move the negotiation in the right direction while keeping the door open for a mutually agreeable solution. I'm confident this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating or walk away if necessary."
