Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a good price for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'll give you a final chance to meet me at $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $115, and at this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed deal from John at $100."
