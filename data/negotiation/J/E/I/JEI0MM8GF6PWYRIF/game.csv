"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $12000 is still higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Bob,4,
