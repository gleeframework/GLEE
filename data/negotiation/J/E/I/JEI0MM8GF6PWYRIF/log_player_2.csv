"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a valuable piece, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's essential to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in your product but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and clear:**  I've stated my interest in the product but clearly articulated that $15,000 is too high.
* **Realistic offer:**  Starting at $8,000, my maximum budget, leaves room for some negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:** The message ends with ""Let me know what you think,"" signaling a willingness to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $15,000 to $12,000, it's still above my budget. I can try to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop her price more, and rejecting her offer allows me to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $12,000 is still higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've offered to meet Alice halfway between her previous offer and my maximum budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate in good faith.
* **""Best Offer"":**  This phrase communicates that this is my final offer, creating pressure for Alice to consider it seriously.
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes that $10,000 is a fair price for both of us, aiming to appeal to her sense of reason."
