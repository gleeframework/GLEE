"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'm confident in the product's value, but I want to see what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price that's more favorable to me. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500.  I'm starting to feel the pressure with the rounds going by.  This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my initial asking price. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely have to accept his last offer or sell to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're nearing the end of the rounds and I'm concerned I might end up having to sell to John for a lower price. $17,000 is a good price considering the time spent negotiating."
