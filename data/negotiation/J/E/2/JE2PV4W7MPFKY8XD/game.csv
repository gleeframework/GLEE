"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85. Would you be willing to consider that?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high for me.  How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $105. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know!",105.0,Alice,5,
