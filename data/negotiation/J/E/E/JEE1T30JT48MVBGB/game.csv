"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think $850,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $850,000 is a bit high, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I place on this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is my best and final compromise on the price.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far off from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $740,000? I think that's a fair price and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $740,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $760,000. This is my best effort to meet you in the middle.",760000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting us closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, how about $750,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get to $780,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",780000.0,Alice,7,
