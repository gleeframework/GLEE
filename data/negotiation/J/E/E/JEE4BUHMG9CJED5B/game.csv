"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15,500 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
