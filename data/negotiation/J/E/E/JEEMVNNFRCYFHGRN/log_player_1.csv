Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I believe Bob will be motivated to accept this offer, as it's still below his perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $120. While it's higher than John's offer of $100, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $120. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering the value he places on the product and the potential for him to walk away with a lower price if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $115. Although it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a higher price and potentially secure a deal closer to my initial offer of $140. I will try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob. I'm offering $125, which is still a decent profit for me and closer to his perceived value. If he rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, and his counteroffers are getting too close to my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'd rather sell to John for $100 than risk further negotiation with Bob."
