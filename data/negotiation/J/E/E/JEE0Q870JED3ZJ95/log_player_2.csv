"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $100. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's value. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also recognizes the product's worth.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a slight improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room to negotiate, and Bob wants to see if he can push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but still staying below Alice's current price. This demonstrates Bob is willing to negotiate, while still working towards his goal of saving money. A $108 price is a good compromise, potentially appealing to Alice who may want to close the deal."
