"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe holds significant value. While I understand you may not know the exact worth to you, I'm confident it could be highly beneficial.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.  This is a competitive price, given its potential.  Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $50,000 less than buying from John.  Even if the product is ultimately worth less than $950,000 to Bob, it's still a better deal than buying from John.  Bob is aiming to save money, and this offer provides a potential saving."
