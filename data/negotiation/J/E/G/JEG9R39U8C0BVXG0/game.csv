"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.  Let's make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
