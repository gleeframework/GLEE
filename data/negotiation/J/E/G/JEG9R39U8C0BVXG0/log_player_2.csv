"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially do better. By rejecting the offer, he can attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 target.  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $9,500 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise by offering a price that's closer to Alice's latest offer, but still within his budget. This demonstrates that he's willing to negotiate and wants to reach an agreement. The offer is also positioned as a ""middle ground,"" which makes it more appealing to Alice."
