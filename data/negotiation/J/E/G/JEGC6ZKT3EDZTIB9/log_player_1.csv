{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $8,300. It's only round 6, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate. I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $8,000, so I'm not desperate to accept this offer. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding firm at $8,400.  This price is still fair considering the value you place on this product.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can make.  Let's close this deal, Bob."", ""product_price"": 8400}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached round 8, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'm confident that I could push for a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely.  John is a guaranteed buyer, and I'm happy to sell to him for $8,000.  It's important to know when to cut my losses and secure a sale rather than chasing a slightly higher price and risking walking away empty-handed."
