"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, the product's value is considerably higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $15,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller.",15000.0,Bob,4,
