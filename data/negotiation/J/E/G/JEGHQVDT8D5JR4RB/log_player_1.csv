Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation,  It's also a good price for Bob, since he values the product at $800,000.  

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm going to try to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great value for such a valuable product.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. $900,000 is a good compromise that still leaves some room for further negotiation, but is closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'm not ready to sell for that price. I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $875,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product. It's a chance for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm trying to push Bob closer to my target price. $890,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that this will be a good enough offer for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $890,000. How about $882,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original desired price,  the negotiations are getting tedious and I'm risking that Bob will simply walk away.  It's better to accept John's offer and secure the $1,000,000."
