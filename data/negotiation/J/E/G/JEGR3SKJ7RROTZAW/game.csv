"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet somewhere closer to the middle? Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bigger leap than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $750,000?  That's a significant move on my part, but I'm serious about getting this deal done.",750000.0,Bob,4,
