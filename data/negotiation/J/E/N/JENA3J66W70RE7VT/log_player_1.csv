Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Here's why this is a good starting strategy for Alice:

* **Starting High:** Alice wants to maximize her profit. By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, she leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can always come down in price. She has a safety net with John's offer, so she's not desperate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps Alice gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay a premium."
