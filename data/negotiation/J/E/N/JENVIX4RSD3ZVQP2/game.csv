"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply not workable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows me to make a profit while being fair to your needs. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is simply not enough for me to move forward. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $795,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down just a little more to $800,000, which is my absolute bottom line.  Let's make this deal happen. ",800000.0,Alice,7,
