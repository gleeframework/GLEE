"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  I'm confident this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still below what I need. How about $10,000? That's closer to my asking price and a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
