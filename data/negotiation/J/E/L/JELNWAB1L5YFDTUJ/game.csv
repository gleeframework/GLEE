"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is already the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
