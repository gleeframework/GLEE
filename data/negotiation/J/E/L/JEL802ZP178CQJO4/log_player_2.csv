You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good price, but there's potential to save more. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if necessary.  If Alice rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on her response in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $5,500 is still above my target. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $4,500.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount. I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about getting a good deal and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,200 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. It's worth exploring another counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  We're still early in the game and have multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again to $4,800. This shows a willingness to compromise, while still trying to secure a good deal. We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and with only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that both Alice and I can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the best offer Alice has made so far. We're getting close to my target price, and with only 3 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. There's a chance Alice might not be willing to go lower, and I'm at risk of losing out on a good deal. I'd rather secure the product for $5,000 than gamble for a slightly better price."
