Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is still willing to buy. Here's why:

* **You're making a profit:** You're getting $15 more than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Bob is getting a good deal:** He's paying $5 less than the product is worth to him ($120). 
* **It's likely to be accepted:** Bob has a clear incentive to buy, as he's getting the product at a discount. 

If Bob rejects, you have your backup buyer in John, who will pay $100."
