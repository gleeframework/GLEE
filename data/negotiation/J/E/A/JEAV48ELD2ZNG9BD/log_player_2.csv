"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a steal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($120 < $150).**
* **Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John ($150 - $120 = $30).** 

While Alice might be overselling the product, the price is still beneficial to you and within your goal of saving money."
