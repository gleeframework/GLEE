"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1100000. This price reflects its unique value and potential.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this price reflects its value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1000000. This price is fair, considering the product's worth and potential. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
