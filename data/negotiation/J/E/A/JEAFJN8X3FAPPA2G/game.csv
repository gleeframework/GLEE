"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
