"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price aligns with its value to me and allows for a fair margin for you. Let me know if this is acceptable.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
