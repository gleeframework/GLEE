Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  This means there's a potential surplus of $400,000 ($1,200,000 - $800,000) to negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** You know John's offer, but Bob doesn't. This gives you a negotiating advantage.

**Negotiation Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Here are a few options:

1. **Aggressive Opening:**
   * {""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

   * **Rationale:** This starts high, aiming for the biggest chunk of the potential surplus. It may lead to counter-offers, but you have room to negotiate down to a still-profitable price.

2. **Balanced Approach:**
   * {""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm offering it at $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value proposition."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

   * **Rationale:** This aims for a roughly even split of the potential surplus. It's less likely to scare Bob away and presents a strong case for a quick agreement.

3. **""Leaving Money on the Table"":**
    * {""message"": ""Bob, because I value our potential partnership, I'm offering you a special price of $900,000 for [product name]. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}

    * **Rationale:** This secures a significant profit for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. It might make him feel like he got a great deal and be less likely to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive approach might be preferable.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, be prepared to hold firm on your price or consider a counter-offer.

**Ultimately, the best offer depends on your risk tolerance and your assessment of Bob's negotiating style.**"
