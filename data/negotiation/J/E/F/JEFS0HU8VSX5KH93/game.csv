"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While $800000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire the product at a reasonable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $875000. This is a final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you sticking with this. Let's try to find a final compromise. I'm willing to go up to $800000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll make one final offer: $825000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests in this transaction.",825000.0,Alice,7,
