"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering your minimum and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to at least get $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. While your offer is getting closer, I still need to get at least $1,090,000 for this to be worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and see if we can finalize this deal.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
