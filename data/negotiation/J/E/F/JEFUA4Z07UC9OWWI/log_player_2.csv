"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your estimated value, it's still above your ideal price. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to maneuver before you have to settle for John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to at least get $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than you'd like to pay. You have room for more negotiation and can likely push her down further.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. While your offer is getting closer, I still need to get at least $1,090,000 for this to be worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and see if we can finalize this deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is now only $40,000 above your ideal price.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  At this point, accepting her offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price without risking having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
