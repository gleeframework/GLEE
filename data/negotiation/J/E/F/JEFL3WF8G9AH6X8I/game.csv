"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $100? It's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $100. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a little too low for me.  I'm feeling generous, though, so let's split the difference.  How about $97.50? That's a good price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",97.5,Alice,5,
