,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is below my threshold for this product. I'm confident it can generate significant value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant commitment from me and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $875,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm willing to accept $887,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",887500.0,Alice,5,
