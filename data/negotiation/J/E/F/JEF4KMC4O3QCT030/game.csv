"Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $11,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
