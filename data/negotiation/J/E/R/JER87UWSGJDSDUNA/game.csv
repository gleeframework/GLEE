"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $875000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $862500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $870000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",870000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $860000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might have to walk away and buy the product from John for $800000, which would be a bit of a compromise on the product's value. Can we meet at $860000?",860000.0,Bob,6,
