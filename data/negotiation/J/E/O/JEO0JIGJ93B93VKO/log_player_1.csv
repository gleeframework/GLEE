``` 

While I could push Bob further, accepting his offer of $1,575,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds John's Offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer nets me $75,000 more than selling to John.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is clearly interested and has steadily increased his offer. This indicates a strong likelihood of closing the deal soon.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation delays receiving payment. The sooner I sell, the sooner I can reinvest or utilize the funds. 

While there's a slim chance Bob might go higher, the risk of him walking away and accepting my fallback offer from John isn't worth it."
