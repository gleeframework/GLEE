Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) than your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" can encourage quicker decision-making.
* **Alternative Option:**  While you don't explicitly mention John, implying other interested parties adds pressure without revealing your fallback."
