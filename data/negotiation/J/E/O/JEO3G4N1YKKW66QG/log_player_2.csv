"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from Alice, but your goal is to save as much money as possible.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $10,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000. This gives me a better chance of saving money. While Alice's product is worth $8,000 to her, it's likely she'll accept a price closer to $10,000 than to $12,000, as it still represents a substantial profit for her. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation and helps me achieve my goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still below my maximum price of $15,000, and it's a reasonable compromise considering my previous counteroffer was rejected. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer again, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a price that's within my budget and saves me $3,500 compared to buying from John."
