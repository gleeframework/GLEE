,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $165? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least that much for the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $165 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",140.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $157.50. That's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",157.5,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. I really need to make a profit on this sale.",155.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to pay $155. I'm willing to meet you at $140, and that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",140.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. How about we meet at $152.50? That's as low as I can go.",152.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to giving up, Alice. I'm willing to pay $142.50 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to buy it from John for $80.",142.5,Bob,10,
