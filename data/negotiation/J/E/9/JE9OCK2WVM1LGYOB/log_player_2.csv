"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no guarantee of success, but the potential for a larger saving is worth the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he starts with a counteroffer that's $50,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  The counteroffer is still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price and only $20,000 more than Bob's initial counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price, but also risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids the potential for further negotiation failures."
