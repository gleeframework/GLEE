"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He can counteroffer with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10800, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and closer to his desired price.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject another counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
