"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to 100. How about we meet in the middle at 130? I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $100. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm at 100, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 125? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,5,
