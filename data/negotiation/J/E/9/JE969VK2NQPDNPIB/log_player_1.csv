{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob. This can help build a rapport and make him feel more confident in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and even lower than what John is willing to pay. It's important to hold firm and demonstrate my value for the product.  I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're working within a budget, but this product is exceptionally valuable and I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties given the value I see in the product.

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is equal to what John is willing to pay. While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair offer considering the negotiation process. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and prevents further haggling."
