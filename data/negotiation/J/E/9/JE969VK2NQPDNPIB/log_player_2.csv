Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're working within a budget, but this product is exceptionally valuable and I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects its worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, how about $1,050,000?  This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us.
