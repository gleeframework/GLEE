"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it could really benefit you and it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to offer $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option.  Here's why:

* **Value:** You're getting the product for $13,000, which is within your budget of $15,000.
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away, leaving you to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Potential Savings:** While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are only $1,000.  It's not worth the risk of losing the deal."
