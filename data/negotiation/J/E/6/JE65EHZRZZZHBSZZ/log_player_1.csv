Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,200,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Create Urgency:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer might encourage Bob to make a decision faster. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
