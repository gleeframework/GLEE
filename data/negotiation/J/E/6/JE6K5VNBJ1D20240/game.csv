Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $10000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay $8500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8500 is a bit too low for me. Considering its value to me is at least $10000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise that I hope you'll consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Alice. While I understand the value of the product to you, my budget constraints prevent me from accepting $11000. I would like to propose an offer of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10000. Considering the value of the product to me is at least $10000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement, Alice. I understand your position regarding the product's value. However, given my current financial situation, I cannot agree to $10500. I would like to propose an offer of $9800 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",9800.0,Bob,6,
