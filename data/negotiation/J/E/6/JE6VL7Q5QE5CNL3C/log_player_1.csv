Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $800,000, my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $800,000.
* **Negotiation:** By offering $950,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still ensuring a significantly higher profit than John's offer.  

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by:

* **Achieving a good price:** $950,000 is a good middle ground that potentially benefits both of us.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While Bob might reject the offer, I still have a guaranteed $800,000 sale with John.

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
