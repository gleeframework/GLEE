"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget, $1,400,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000.  This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
