"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you and a good price for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can try to get a better deal from Alice. $11,000 is still more than your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,800? That's a good middle ground, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, Alice has already come down quite a bit. Accepting her offer at $10,800 saves you $200 compared to buying from John and is still within your budget."
