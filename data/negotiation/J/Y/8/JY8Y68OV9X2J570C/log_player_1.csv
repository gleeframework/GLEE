Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you and a good price for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $11,000 is a reasonable starting point.
* **It's below your minimum:** You want at least $12,000, so you have room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is brief and focuses on the price.

This allows for potential negotiation while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  That way we both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $10,800? That's a good middle ground, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10800}
