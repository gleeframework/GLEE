"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $90 is within your budget, you know John is offering the product for $100. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her, closer to her $80 value. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer."
