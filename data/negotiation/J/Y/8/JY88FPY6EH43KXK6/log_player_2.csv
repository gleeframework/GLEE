"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and potential. I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can help you achieve [mention a specific benefit for Bob]. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob compared to his $15,000 budget and John's offer. 
* **Progress:** Alice has come down from her initial $13,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject further offers, and he might end up paying John's higher price. Accepting now secures a good deal."
