"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit high for me at this time. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I need to consider the value I've placed on this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'll need to add a bit more to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a solid sale.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,100,000 offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1120000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making good progress, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1110000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,110,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,120,000 and $1,110,000, which is $1,115,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
