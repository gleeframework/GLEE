"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $15,000 and gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to get as close to my ideal price as possible, but I'm also willing to accept a lower price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I hope this offer is appealing enough for Bob to consider, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a few more times if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $16,500, which is only $500 below my initial offer.  This is a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $15,000. It's time to close this deal!"
