"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. Given the value of the product and the opportunity cost of considering other offers, I am willing to negotiate closer to my original asking price. Therefore, I am now offering the product to you for $600000. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the true value of the product.",600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $600000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the potential savings compared to John's offer, I'm willing to go up to $500000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",500000.0,Bob,4,
