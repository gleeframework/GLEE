**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $550,000 is getting closer to my counteroffer of $500,000. It's still a good price compared to John's $1,200,000, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy this product at a good price.  There's always a chance I could negotiate further, but I'm willing to accept this offer and secure the product."
