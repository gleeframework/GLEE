"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than John's price of $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000.  It's only $150,000 more than John's price, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a longer process and a potential deadlock. Accepting the offer secures the product and saves time."
