You have three options:

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $12,000 is over your budget, and you can potentially get a better deal with Alice or buy from John."

I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is still within my budget and hopefully a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll try a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to move closer to my price."

I'm offering $9,500. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. Hopefully, this will be a more acceptable compromise for both of us."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still over my budget. Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, it's a better option than accepting Alice's offer."
