Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $14,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $16,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,500 is simply too low for me. It's getting a bit frustrating that we can't find common ground. I'm willing to go as low as $15,500, which is still a good deal for you, given the product's value. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,525 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $15,250, which is a reasonable compromise.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.
