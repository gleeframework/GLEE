"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  By offering $13,000, Bob is making a significant counteroffer, showing Alice that he's serious about negotiating. 
* **Be Polite:** A friendly message helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:** While $13,000 is the absolute maximum Bob wants to pay, there's still some wiggle room for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a fair compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's initial offer and her previous asking price.
* **Time Factor:** It's important to consider that Bob has only 10 rounds to close the deal. Rejecting again might lead to a longer negotiation and potentially increase the price further.
* **Value:**  While $13,500 is more than Bob's initial goal, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John at $15,000."
