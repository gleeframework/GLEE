"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,150,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for profit for both of us.  I'm hopeful we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue the discussion and present a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a compromise. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. To close this deal, I'm offering a final price of $1,075,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to finalize this transaction. I'm hoping we can agree on this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to get the best possible deal, and while I'd like to earn more, his final offer of $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations."
