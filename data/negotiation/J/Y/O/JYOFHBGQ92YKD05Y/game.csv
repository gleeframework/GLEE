"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $135?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $132 is still a little low for me, but I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $134.  Let's split the difference and get this done. What do you say?",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $134 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $131. Can you consider that?",131.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to work with you on this. $131 is very close, but I'm still a little hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $132? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize this transaction.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,8,
