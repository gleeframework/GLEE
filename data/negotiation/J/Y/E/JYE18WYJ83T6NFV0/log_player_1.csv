"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $1,100,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Alice. I think $1,225,000 would be a reasonable price for both of us. Let's aim for this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm aware that we're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds.  $1,225,000 is a good compromise and  it's still significantly higher than selling to John."
