Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Emphasis:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, hinting at its worth without revealing my exact cost.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while ensuring I don't sell below my minimum value.  If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and decide whether to continue or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $110 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he is interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer to try to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  I know I can always sell to John for $120, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise between my minimum ($120) and Bob's offer ($110). 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" Bob is getting to encourage him to accept. 
* **Staying firm:**  I'm not going significantly lower than my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility.

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $130. I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $125 is a fair compromise, meeting me in the middle of my last counteroffer ($130) and his previous offer ($120).
* **Slightly above minimum:** While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum of $120, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away or continuing to negotiate at lower prices. 

Accepting this offer allows me to sell the product for a decent price without risking further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
