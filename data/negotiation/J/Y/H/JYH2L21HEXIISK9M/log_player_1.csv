Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,350,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Strong but Encouraging Message:** The message highlights the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity, making the offer more appealing.

By setting the initial price high but not unreasonable, you increase your chances of either:

1. **Bob accepting:**  You secure a higher profit than selling to John.
2. **Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price still higher than $1,500,000. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
