Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 130} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($150) to aim for a higher profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, allowing me to potentially get closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have the security of selling to John for $100 if negotiations with Bob fail. This ensures I don't settle for anything less than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100 for this product. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100 to you + profit margin). By immediately accepting, I would be settling for a no-profit situation. I know the product is worth more to Bob, so I'll try to negotiate a higher price.  I'll use John as a safety net if the negotiation goes south."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're working within a budget, Bob. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This offer still gives you a great value for a product you'll really enjoy."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by significantly decreasing my initial price while still staying above my absolute minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the higher price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer maintains some negotiating room while keeping me in a position to accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending within my $100 budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between, say $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $110 provides a $10 profit, which is better than nothing and meets my minimum requirement to make some profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a reasonable offer now allows me to move on to other potential sales."
