"Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly unique and valuable. I believe this product could be a game-changer for you, and it's worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects its immense value.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must admit I'm disappointed. This product offers you a substantial return on investment, and $900,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product represents a good opportunity, but I need the numbers to work for me as well.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
