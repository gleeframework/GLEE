"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly unique and valuable. I believe this product could be a game-changer for you, and it's worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident this price reflects its immense value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. There is ample room for negotiation. Accepting his offer at this stage would leave a lot of money on the table. You're better off countering and seeing if you can negotiate a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must admit I'm disappointed. This product offers you a substantial return on investment, and $900,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  The message conveys firmness by expressing disappointment and reiterating the product's value. However, it remains fair by offering a significant price reduction to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer maintains a strong position above your minimum price while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Time Constraint (Implicit):**  By stating ""This is my best offer,"" you subtly introduce a sense of urgency without resorting to aggressive tactics. This might encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product represents a good opportunity, but I need the numbers to work for me as well.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering your minimum acceptable price. While there might be a slight chance of negotiating him up a little more, it's getting riskier.  Here's why accepting is the best move now:

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** You're securing the minimum amount you need to achieve your goal.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing negotiations could backfire. Bob might lower his offer, or you might reach an impasse, forcing you to settle for John's offer anyway.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves time and lets you move on to other opportunities."
