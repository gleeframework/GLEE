"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into this negotiation, I'm willing to go up to $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not satisfied with $800,000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to meet you at $815,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
