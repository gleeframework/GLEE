"I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial asking price. How about $825,000?  This is a fair compromise, and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $825,000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $775,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's split the difference between my last offer and yours. I'm willing to accept $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $800,000, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can we make a deal at this price?",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $800,000.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $797,500?  This is a small increase, and it shows my commitment to making this deal work.",797500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $797,500. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no further. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",795000.0,Bob,8,
