Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a discount:** It's less than my minimum price of $15,000, making it more attractive to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** The $14,000 price is above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Is not too low:** Offering a significantly lower price might make me appear desperate and could encourage Bob to make a very low counteroffer. 

I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'm not willing to accept it yet. Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a lower price, but I believe there's room for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my investment in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel there might be room for a better deal. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,200 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,200 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I've already lowered my price from $14,000 to $13,500 and it seems Bob is not willing to meet me halfway. I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation and it's clear we're at an impasse.  It's better to cut my losses and move on to a buyer who values the product more. I'm confident that John will be happy to buy it at my desired price."
