"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it also shows I value the product highly. I'm willing to accept a lower offer, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm not happy with Bob's initial offer, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing number for Bob, and we can continue to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not sure I can get more from Bob. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
