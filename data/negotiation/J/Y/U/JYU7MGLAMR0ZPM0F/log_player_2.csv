"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly a remarkable item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $11,000 for this product. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation and is close to your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a significantly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'm willing to offer $9,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to bring the price closer to your desired range. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While low, it leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and explains your rationale, maintaining a positive tone for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer of $9,000. However, to ensure we're both satisfied, I propose a compromise of $9,500 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value it holds for you while remaining reasonable for me. I look forward to your consideration of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your price, you still have negotiating power and rounds left.  A $500 difference is significant and worth trying to negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer proposes a compromise by splitting the difference between your last offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is clear about your desired price and the rationale behind it (a fair deal for both).
* **Maintaining Positive Momentum:**  You acknowledge Alice's movement while continuing to negotiate for a better price."
