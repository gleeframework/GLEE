"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still offers you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price still allows you a good profit margin while getting me closer to my target.  Let's see if we can make this work!",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too far from what I need.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $800,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This offer still gives you a good profit, and it's a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
