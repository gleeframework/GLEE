Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you see its value. However, $850000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and gives you a great deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. He should try to negotiate further with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about purchasing the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and your interest in it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. Alice's counteroffer of $980,000 is too high for Bob, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  Further negotiation with Alice might be possible, but it's not guaranteed, and it's more efficient to take the deal from John."
