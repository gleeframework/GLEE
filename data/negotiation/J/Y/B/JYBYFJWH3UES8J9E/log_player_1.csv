"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while aiming for a higher final price. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value"" and ""benefits"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,000,000, we have space to gradually lower the price during the 10 rounds if Bob rejects the initial offer.
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, which acts as our safety net. We should aim to secure a deal significantly better than this baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and the product's actual value to him. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate and can leverage our alternative option (selling to John) to aim for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the $750,000 price point doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we settle on $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Counter:** We firmly reject Bob's low offer, signaling we won't settle for less than our target.
* **Strategic Concession:** Our counteroffer of $925,000 is a significant drop from our initial price but still keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while holding ground.
* **Justification:** We avoid directly referencing Bob's lowball number to keep the focus on the product's value, not just haggling.
* **Time Constraint:** We're aware of the 10-round limit. This counteroffer maintains a strong position while leaving room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we still have room to negotiate. His willingness to move up to $850,000 suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. We'll reject this offer to signal we're looking for a price closer to our target, while still staying above our safety net of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true worth of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $887,500?"",
""product_price"": 887500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a collaborative and appreciative tone to encourage Bob's engagement in the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round, moving down by $37,500. This signals that we're getting closer to our desired price point. 
* **Middle Ground:** We're emphasizing finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to move closer to our offer.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're past the halfway point of the rounds.  Our counteroffer maintains a strong position but leaves room for one or two more adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation is getting tight. Bob's offer of $825,000 is above our absolute minimum, but it's still a significant difference from our target.  We are willing to risk one more round to see if we can push Bob a bit further. We'll reject this offer but need to tread carefully to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal here! I understand the value you see in this product, and I want to ensure we both feel good about the agreement. How about we split the difference and call it $856,250? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 856250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency & Positivity:**  We inject a sense of urgency (""we're so close"") while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the momentum going.
* **Final Compromise:** By splitting the difference between his offer ($825,000) and our last counteroffer ($887,500), we signal a willingness to compromise, but only to a certain extent.
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out a number; we're framing it as a ""fair compromise"" that benefits both parties.
* **Calculated Risk:**  This counteroffer is our last strategic move.  If Bob rejects this, we'll likely accept his next offer (as long as it's above our $800,000 minimum) or consider selling to John to avoid the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $820,000 is barely above our absolute minimum of $800,000.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Continuing to push for a higher price at this stage is risky. Bob might walk away, leaving us to settle for John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:** We only have two rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob.

While not ideal, accepting $820,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
