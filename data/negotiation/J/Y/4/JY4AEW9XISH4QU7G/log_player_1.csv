Given its incredible potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you have placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm happy to offer $1,400,000 as a final compromise. I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's potential and my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, but it's still below John's standing offer of $1,500,000. While there's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll reach John's price.  At this point, it's strategically safer to take John's guaranteed offer and avoid the risk of Bob not meeting the minimum price."
