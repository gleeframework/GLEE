"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the chance to be the sole owner of this unique product.  Given its incredible potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you have placed on it.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a significant offer, the value of this product truly is unique.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. I'm confident it will more than pay for itself in your hands.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm happy to offer $1,400,000 as a final compromise. I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's potential and my budget limitations.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
