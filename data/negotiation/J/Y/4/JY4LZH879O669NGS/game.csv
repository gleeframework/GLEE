"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115. It's a steal for its quality and functionality.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more money. Can you consider my offer?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $107? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $107 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $109. It's closer to your offer and still gives me a fair price.  What do you think?",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $106? I'm really close to my limit, and I'd love to make a deal.",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $106 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $108. This is my final offer, as I'm running out of time.  Let me know if you're interested.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're running out of time, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $100, which would be $104. Can you consider this offer?",104.0,Bob,8,
