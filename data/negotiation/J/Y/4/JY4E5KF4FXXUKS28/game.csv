"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as high as I can go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think we're getting close, though!",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find that sweet spot. How about we split the difference and go with $935,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go up to $925,000. That's my final offer. Let's see if we can make a deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're holding firm, but $925,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. To close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $930,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",915000.0,Bob,8,
