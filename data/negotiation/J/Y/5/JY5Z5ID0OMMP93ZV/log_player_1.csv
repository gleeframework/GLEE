{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000** is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* This strategy balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and my starting offer.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price and see if we can reach a compromise. I'm not ready to settle for $850,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to receive for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900,000.  This price still leaves significant value for you, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Bob's perspective while reiterating my position. It emphasizes the value Bob will still receive at this price. 
* **Goal:** The aim is to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal without having to resort to selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $900,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's still not ideal, accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of a protracted negotiation or selling to John for a lower price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and close the deal."
