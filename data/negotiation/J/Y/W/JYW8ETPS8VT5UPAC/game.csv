"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $10,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to the value of the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Alice,5,
