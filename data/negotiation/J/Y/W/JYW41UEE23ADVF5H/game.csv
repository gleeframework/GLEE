"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits this product holds. I'm open to discussing this further, but I do have another interested buyer willing to pay $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1200000.  This reflects the unique value proposition of this product and the potential it holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
