"Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  I'm still a bit too high.  How about $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
