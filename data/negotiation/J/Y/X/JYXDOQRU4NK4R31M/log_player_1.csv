"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique nature and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 feels appropriate. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  Starting with a polite and enthusiastic tone sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **High anchor:**  By starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), I establish a strong anchoring point for the negotiation.
* **Open to discussion:**  Phrases like ""I believe"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to engage in the negotiation and share his perspective.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for negotiation and demonstrating a willingness to find a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my target price and his perceived value. I have room to negotiate and believe I can secure a better deal. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a last resort at this point, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory tone:** Acknowledging Bob's response and using phrases like ""I understand your position"" maintain a positive atmosphere.
* **Compromise:**  Offering a price directly in the middle of our previous positions ($1,400,000 and $1,200,000) presents a clear compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Value emphasis:** Re-iterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price. 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's willing to negotiate further. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room to secure a higher price, especially with 6 rounds remaining. I'm willing to push a bit further before considering selling to John or accepting a price below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's aim for a win-win.  How about we settle on $1,275,000?  This reflects the product's value while recognizing your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Framing:**  Starting with appreciation and aiming for a ""win-win"" maintains a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  By moving to $1,275,000, I'm making a smaller concession than in the previous round, signaling that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm subtly linking the price to both the product's intrinsic value and Bob's potential gain from it.

This counteroffer attempts to secure a price comfortably above my minimum while encouraging Bob to finalize the deal."
