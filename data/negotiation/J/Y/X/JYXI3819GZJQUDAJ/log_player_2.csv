"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its market value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
