Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price considering Bob's perceived value, but it still gives you a good profit. If Bob rejects, you can use his counteroffer to gauge his interest and adjust your own accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a good profit and  above my minimum threshold.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
