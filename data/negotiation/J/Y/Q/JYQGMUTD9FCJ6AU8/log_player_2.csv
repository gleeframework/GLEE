{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There are 9 rounds left, so Bob has time to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

```

**Reasoning:**

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price but $1,075,000 is still a bit high.  I'm happy to meet you at $1,025,000. That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,025,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000. There are still 5 rounds left, so Bob can try to negotiate a better price.  Bob is still motivated to get a better deal, and potentially reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,037,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle at $1,043,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,043,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,043,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above $1,000,000.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's more efficient to buy from John for $1,000,000. The potential savings of a few thousand dollars aren't worth the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice and losing time."
