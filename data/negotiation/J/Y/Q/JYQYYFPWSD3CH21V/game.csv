"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. How about $7,500? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $8,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but no lower. It's a small premium, and I think it's worth it for the quality of the product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
