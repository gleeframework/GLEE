,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1900000. This takes into account your initial interest and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts on this.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1700000 is simply too far below my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1850000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your interest and ensures I'm still getting a reasonable price for my valuable product.  What do you say?",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer. However, $1750000 is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1800000.
