"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair starting point for discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe your offer undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to move down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,100,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we bridge the gap with a final offer of $1,180,000?  This reflects my commitment to getting this deal done, and I believe it's a fair price for such a valuable asset.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,160,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
