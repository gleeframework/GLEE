Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated the product is worth at least $150 to you, so this offer is within your acceptable range.
* **It's below John's offer:**  This gives you room to negotiate with Bob if necessary. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's close enough to Bob's value that he might accept, but also leaves room for potential counteroffers. 

Let me know how the negotiation goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $100, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you.  It's better to try and negotiate further to get closer to your minimum price or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
