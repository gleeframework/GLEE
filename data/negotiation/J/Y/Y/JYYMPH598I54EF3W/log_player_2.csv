"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price that is fair to both of us. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth a lot to you.  Let's talk about $12,000.  This price is a great deal for you, and it gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  $12,000 is significantly less than the $15,000 Bob would pay John. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Even though Alice's offer is not the absolute lowest price, it still achieves Bob's goal of saving money."
