"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, aiming for a good profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm going to try to get closer to my initial price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering a price of $9,500.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
