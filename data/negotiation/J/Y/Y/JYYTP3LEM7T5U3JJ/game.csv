"Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value. Let's work together to finalize this.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,200,000. It's a significant amount of money, but it's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and will be mutually beneficial. Let's reach an agreement before we risk losing this opportunity.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  To make this work, I need a price closer to my last offer of $1,200,000.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.  How about $1,175,000? This is a small adjustment, and it keeps us both in the negotiation.",1175000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,175,000. I'm still thinking $1,150,000 is the maximum I can pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,162,500? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1162500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $1,162,500 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need a price closer to $1,175,000. Let's find a compromise - how about we settle on $1,170,000? This is a small adjustment and could help us reach an agreement. ",1170000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm really interested in this product, but I've reached my limit. I'm willing to pay $1,165,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,500,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1165000.0,Bob,10,
