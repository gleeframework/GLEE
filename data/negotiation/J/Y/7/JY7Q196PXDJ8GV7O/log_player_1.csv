{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept. While $900,000 is better than $800,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $950,000. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $925,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $925,000, so I'll offer $912,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my target price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely.  I'm happy to accept $912,500, as it's a good amount and I can still make a profit."
