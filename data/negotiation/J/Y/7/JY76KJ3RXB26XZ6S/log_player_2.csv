"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000).  While a good deal, there's room for negotiation to save even more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $950000? I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we try $912500? It's a slight concession from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his ideal target.  There's still a small window for negotiation to get a lower price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $915000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we try $907500? It's a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob could technically continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $907,500 is getting very close to Bob's ideal price.  At this point, it's likely not worth the effort and risk of further negotiation.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is significantly lower than the market value and saves a considerable amount of money.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price but could also risk losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
