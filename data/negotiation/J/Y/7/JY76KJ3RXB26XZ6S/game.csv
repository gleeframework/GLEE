"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $950000? I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we try $912500? It's a slight concession from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",912500.0,Alice,5,
