,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents a fair price for this product, I understand your perspective. Let's meet in the middle - how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could you do $13,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm motivated to sell, but $13,000 is too low. How about we settle at $16,000?  That's a significant reduction on my part and I believe a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $14,000.  Would you be open to that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
