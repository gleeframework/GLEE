"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let me see if we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000. Let's try $10,500. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still at my limit.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $10,000? This is a fair price that would allow us both to make a good deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $11,750. This is a good compromise that I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,7,
