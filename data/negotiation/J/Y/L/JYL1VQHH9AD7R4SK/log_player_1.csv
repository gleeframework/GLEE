"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to you and my own needs."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value to me. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $7,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. Bob has shown interest and acknowledged the product's value, so there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for a product that's clearly worth much more to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise and falls within my acceptable range. Accepting this offer will allow me to sell the product for more than what John is offering and still secure a good profit."
