You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a lower price than Alice values the product, Bob can still get a better deal. He should try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9000?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, he's still aiming for a price closer to $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."
