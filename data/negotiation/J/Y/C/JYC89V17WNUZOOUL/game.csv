"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This still gives you a good value for the product, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
