Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe there's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves some room for profit. I believe this price is fair and will hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my initial target. While I would still prefer more, I believe this is a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation. It's unlikely I'll get a much higher offer from Bob, and continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and eliminates the risk of ending up with John's lower offer."
