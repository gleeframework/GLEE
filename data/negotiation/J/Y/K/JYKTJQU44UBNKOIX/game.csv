"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,100,000 to make it worth my while.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,100,000, so I'm proposing $1,012,500. This is my final offer on the lower end of the spectrum.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
