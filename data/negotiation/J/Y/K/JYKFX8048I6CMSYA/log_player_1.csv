Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this will incentivize Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for some profit. I believe this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob while still being within a reasonable range for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower.  I'm worried that further negotiation will only lead to more back-and-forth without a significant increase in his offer. To avoid risking a protracted negotiation with an uncertain outcome, I'm going to sell the product to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
