"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation while also being above Bob's perceived value. By offering a price that is significantly lower than my minimum, I increase the chances of Bob accepting.  If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer accordingly in the following rounds, or choose to sell to John if the negotiations become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe there's still room for a profitable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
My counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this price is still reasonable for me while offering Bob a better price than his initial counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, hopefully leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is close enough to my minimum and the negotiations have taken several rounds. It's time to secure the deal before potentially losing him entirely.  Also, the risk of selling to John means there's a chance I could end up with a lower profit, so it's better to secure this offer."
