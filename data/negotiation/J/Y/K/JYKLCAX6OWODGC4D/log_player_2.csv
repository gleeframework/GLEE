``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Savings:**  Buying from Alice saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so Bob is getting a good deal even at $950,000. 
* **Alternative:**  Rejecting the offer and buying from John would cost more and offers no additional benefit."
