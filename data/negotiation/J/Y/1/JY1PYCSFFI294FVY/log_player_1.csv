Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 gives room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also emphasizes the perceived value of the product.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay above market value. If I had more information, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
