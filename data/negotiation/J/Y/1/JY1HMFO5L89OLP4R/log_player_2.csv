"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this better deal and maximize your savings."
