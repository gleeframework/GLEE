"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if he can negotiate a lower price. He also has the safety net of buying from John for $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. I know the product is worth more to you, but that's my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's budget and still a better deal than buying from John for $8,000. It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product at a reasonable price."
