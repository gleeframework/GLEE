"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,750,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This price better aligns with my financial capacity while still respecting the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
