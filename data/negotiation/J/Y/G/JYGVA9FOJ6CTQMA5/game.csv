"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this time. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This represents a significant price difference, but still leaves you with a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
