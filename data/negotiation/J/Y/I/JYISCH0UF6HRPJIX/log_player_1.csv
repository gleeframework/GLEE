Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a price that is above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested in a lower price.  I believe this is a good starting point to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum value of $80.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial $100 asking price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
