"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's already above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You need to try and get the price down.
* **Buying from John is not a good option yet.**  You're better off trying to negotiate with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired budget. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can try to push for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is not a good option yet.** You can likely get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my limits."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'll make one more compromise and offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** $1,125,000 is below your maximum limit of $1,500,000.
* **It's a reasonable compromise.** Alice has already lowered her price significantly.
* **Buying from John is a worse option.**  You can get the product for a lower price from Alice. 

It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal. You've saved a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
