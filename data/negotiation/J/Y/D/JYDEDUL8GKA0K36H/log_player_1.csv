Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 allows for some negotiation downward while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" and ""return on investment"" helps justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit by selling to Bob outweighs settling for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
