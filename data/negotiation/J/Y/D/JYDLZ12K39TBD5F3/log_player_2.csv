Bob should reject the offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  It's worth exploring if he can get closer to his $8,000 target."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's room for both of them to compromise."
