"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not going too high, I leave space for Bob to make a counteroffer and still arrive at a mutually acceptable price. 
* **The goal is to reach a price between $80 and $120**.  I'll use the next rounds to adjust the price based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to do $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($120).**  While it's closer to my desired range, it's still too low.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  I want to see if I can get Bob to move closer to my desired price.
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and John is a reliable option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate your interest!  $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50?  That's still a good deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth in paying a bit more.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Staying friendly helps keep the negotiation open and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92.50 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend at the moment.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120).**  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss. 
* **We're getting close to a deal.** I see potential in this negotiation and want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **I want to explore a counteroffer.**  I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $91. This way we both get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):**  I'm continuing to show flexibility by again offering a compromise price, this time splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Making it clear that this is a final offer:**  Using language like ""Let's split the difference"" implies that this is my final offer. 
* **Keeping the tone positive and encouraging:** I'm using a positive tone and asking for Bob's opinion, which encourages a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $91 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $89.50? This would allow both of us to close the deal with a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($120).**  While it's closer to my desired range, I'm not willing to accept a price this low.
* **We've reached an impasse.** Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.
* **John is a reliable option.**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $120. It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation with Bob."
