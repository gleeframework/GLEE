"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. I'm willing to throw in some extras, though - I'll include a free maintenance package worth $500. That brings the total value to $11500. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10200. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like I'm giving away the product for free. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but that's as low as I can go. I'll throw in another free service to sweeten the deal - a complimentary installation worth $200. That way, you'll get the product and the installation for a total of $10700. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it!",10500.0,Alice,7,
