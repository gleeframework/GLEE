Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting higher gives room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value by mentioning ""significant value"" but avoids being overly aggressive.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is conversational (""What do you think?"") to encourage a response and potential counter-offer from Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's risk tolerance:**  We don't know how price-sensitive Bob is or if he's willing to negotiate. There's a chance he might reject the offer outright.
* **Time constraints:**  If we're on a tight timeline, a slightly lower initial offer might be strategically better to secure the sale quickly.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario (selling above Bob's perceived value) while acknowledging we have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
