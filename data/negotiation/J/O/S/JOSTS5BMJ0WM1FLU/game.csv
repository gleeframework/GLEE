"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1100000? It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1000000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about $1050000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
