"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
