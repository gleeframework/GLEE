Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also aware that Bob might have a different idea of the product's worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $10,000 as that's my minimum.  Let's see what Bob offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping Bob will increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I still need to make a decent profit.  $12,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same amount I would get from John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob.  It's time to close the deal."
