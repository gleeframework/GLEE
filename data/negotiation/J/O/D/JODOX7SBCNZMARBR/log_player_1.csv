"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a bit more for the product since it's worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $110 is below my minimum price of $120, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125 in this round. It's a compromise between my starting price and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will find it reasonable and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $115 is closer to my minimum price, I still believe we can reach a deal closer to $125. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit more to $122. This is a smaller concession than before, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at a low price. This should encourage Bob to meet me halfway and hopefully seal the deal."
