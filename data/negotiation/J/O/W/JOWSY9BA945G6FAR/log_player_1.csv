"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is immense, and I believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a very high price, I'm attempting to anchor the negotiation around a higher value.  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, his counter-offer might still be higher than he would have considered if I started lower.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,000,000), so I'm not pressured to accept anything less than what I consider acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly closer to my minimum, but it's still a substantial difference. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which I believe reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  I'm making a significant concession to show Bob I'm flexible and serious about closing a deal. However, I'm still keeping the price relatively high, demonstrating that I'm not desperate.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Pressure:** As rounds progress, Bob may become more willing to compromise as well, knowing that I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,700,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our ongoing discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a significant amount of money below my initial ask.  I believe with some more negotiation, I can get Bob closer to $1,500,000. We are past the halfway point in the rounds, but I'm willing to risk a few more to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,400,000, and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This is a classic negotiation tactic that can be effective.  It suggests a sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $1,550,000, I'm essentially splitting the difference between his last offer ($1,400,000) and my previous counter ($1,700,000). 
* **Urgency:** While I'm still willing to negotiate, I'm making it clear that we need to move towards a final decision soon as time is a factor in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could likely push for a slightly higher price, the gains would be incremental at this point. Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity around this range.
* **Time Value:** We are past the halfway mark in the rounds. Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain increases the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer.
* **Solid Profit:**  $1,450,000 is still a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price and is a successful outcome for the negotiation."
