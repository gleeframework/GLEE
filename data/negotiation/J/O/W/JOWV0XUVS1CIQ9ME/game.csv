"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product sounds interesting, your asking price is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, but I'm flexible if you're open to negotiating.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is significantly below what I'm looking to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my initial price. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1150000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair compromise that keeps both of us happy.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
