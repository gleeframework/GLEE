"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great opportunity to acquire something truly special. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since you can get the same product from John for $10,000, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
