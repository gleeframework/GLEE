"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair price, given my budget and the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,295,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.
