"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's aggressive but not unreasonable:**  $1,000,000 is a significant profit for you, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It acknowledges Bob's value:**  Mentioning the value to him shows you've done your research and are willing to negotiate fairly. 
* **It opens the door for discussion:** The message encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible, but also to be flexible enough to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we settle at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below the value of the product to you.  You want to maximize your profit. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and it allows you to make a substantial profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of you, and it's closer to the value of the product for you than the $850,000 he offered previously. 

Accepting this offer allows you to secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
