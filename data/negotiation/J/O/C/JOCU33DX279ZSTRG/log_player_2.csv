"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower.  You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $15,000, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

I'm offering $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$8,500 is still a good price, but you can likely get it lower, especially since Alice rejected your counteroffer. You have 8 rounds left and the option to buy from John for $15,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $7,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I am willing to compromise but still aiming for a price below Alice's latest offer. This should hopefully encourage Alice to accept a price closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,200 is still a good price, but you can likely get it lower, especially since Alice rejected your counteroffer. You have 6 rounds left and the option to buy from John for $15,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
``` 

I'm raising my counteroffer again to $7,800.  I'm getting closer to Alice's last offer, showing willingness to compromise.  Since we have fewer rounds left, I need to get closer to her price point to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, and we have fewer rounds left.  $8,100 is a good price, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
