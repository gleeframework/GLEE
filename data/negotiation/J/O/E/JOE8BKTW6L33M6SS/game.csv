"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. $850000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more favorable for both of us.  How about $800000? This would be a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and your desired selling point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $800000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $825000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
