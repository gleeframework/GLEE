"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to consider. I believe this price is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do better than $1200000. Let's try to get closer to my target price of $1350000. I'm willing to meet you at $1280000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
