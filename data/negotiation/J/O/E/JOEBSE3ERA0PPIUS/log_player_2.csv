"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a lower price before committing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price considering the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,050,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession by coming down to $1,075,000.  While I would prefer to pay $1,050,000,  $1,075,000 is still a good deal for me. It's a significant savings compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in future rounds, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
