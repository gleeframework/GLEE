"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far too low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower and it's better to secure the $8,000 deal with John.  Further haggling with Alice has a low chance of success and risks losing the guaranteed option."
