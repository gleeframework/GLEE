"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1,380,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you and the original price I was thinking of. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,3,
