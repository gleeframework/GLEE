Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is still a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
