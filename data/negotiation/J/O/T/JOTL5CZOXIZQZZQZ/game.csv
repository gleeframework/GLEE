"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $130, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
