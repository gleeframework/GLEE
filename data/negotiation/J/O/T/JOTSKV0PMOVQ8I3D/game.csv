"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
