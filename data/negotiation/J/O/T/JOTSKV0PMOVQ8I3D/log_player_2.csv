"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1200000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's above your maximum budget, and you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by significantly lowering the price.  $900,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, and it signals your willingness to negotiate seriously.  This counteroffer should create pressure on Alice to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to your desired price range, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price.  The counteroffer you'll make in the next round should aim to bridge the remaining gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your offer from the previous round, showing Alice that you're serious about making a deal.  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise and signals your willingness to negotiate.  The message also highlights the product's value to you, reminding Alice of your perspective.  This could encourage Alice to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is at the upper limit of your budget and aligns with what John is offering.  Since you are aiming to save as much money as possible, choosing to buy from John is the best option. This allows you to secure the product at the lowest price without further negotiations."
