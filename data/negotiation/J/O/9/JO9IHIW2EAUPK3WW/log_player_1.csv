I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to capitalize on his potential interest. I'll then be willing to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. However, I'm keeping the option to sell to John open, as he offers my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject it.  I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable, given Bob's previous offer, and will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob has now offered my minimum acceptable price.  There is no point in continuing the negotiation as I can't get a better deal.  It is time to accept his offer."
