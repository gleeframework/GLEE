"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum value while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'll gauge his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum price,  I'm not desperate. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate while also giving Bob a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $130. It's only $10 less than my last counteroffer, and I'm getting closer to my goal of maximizing profit. There's always a chance that Bob will go lower, but I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
