"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000.

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further.  She seems quite firm on her price, and while we might eke out a few more dollars in savings, it's safer and more efficient to go with John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
