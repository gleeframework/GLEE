"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair for both of us. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,250,000? This is my maximum willingness to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about your budget, but I'm still a bit away from a price that makes sense for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,250,000 is just not enough.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000? It's a compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within your range. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
