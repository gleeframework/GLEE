"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a good price, there's room for negotiation since Bob is willing to pay up to $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $100 is a big step down from Alice's initial price, but still within Bob's budget. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $150, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the door open to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price. $105 is a reasonable compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product but still looking for a good deal. This offer keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $108. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $108 is well within Bob's budget.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John is now higher. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while avoiding the risk of paying more to John."
