"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to his target, it's still too high.  There's still room for further negotiation, and if Bob can't get the price down further, he can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This price is the closest to his target of $800,000, and it's likely Alice won't go any lower. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and buying from John would cost less, but potentially result in a lower-quality product or less favorable terms."
