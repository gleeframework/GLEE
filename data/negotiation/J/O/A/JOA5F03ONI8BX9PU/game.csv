"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $885,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
