"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for 115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to 112.50. I can offer you 113, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it.",113.0,Alice,5,
