Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum price. Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your hand entirely, mentioning the ""value"" hints at its worth beyond your asking price, potentially making Bob more amenable.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a gentle pressure to act, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's a gap between the offered price and Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counter-offers while still keeping you well above your minimum.

This strategy aims to capture the most value from Bob while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
