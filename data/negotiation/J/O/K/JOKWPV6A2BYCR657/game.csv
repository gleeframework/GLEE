"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $82. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,
