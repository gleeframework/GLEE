"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price, especially since I have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims for a price significantly lower than Alice's starting point, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also subtly reminds Alice that I have other options by not immediately jumping to a price closer to her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  Meeting halfway between her initial offer and my lowball counter is expected. I'll push a little further since I still have room before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  The message attempts to create a sense of collaboration and agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $82. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely to be successful, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $82 secures a reasonable saving compared to John's price."
