"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show that I'm serious about the deal.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to find common ground. It demonstrates your interest in the product.  However, the value of this product is firmly above your proposed price point. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $2,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
