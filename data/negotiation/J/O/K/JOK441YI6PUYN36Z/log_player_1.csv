"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This offer reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
 ""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a firm starting point and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus towards the potential benefits and away from just the initial cost.
* **Anchoring:**  By presenting a high initial price, I'm anchoring the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects it, his counteroffers are likely to be higher than if I had started lower. 
* **Option to Walk Away:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a guaranteed buyer. This gives me leverage to walk away from the negotiation if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show that I'm serious about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant move from his initial perception of the product's value ($1,000,000), it's still considerably below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about a higher price. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving but also pushes towards a more favorable outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to find common ground. It demonstrates your interest in the product.  However, the value of this product is firmly above your proposed price point. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $2,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
 ""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant reduction from my initial offer ($200,000) to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, my counteroffer is still significantly above both my minimum and his offer. I want to maintain a strong position and guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the higher price, subtly countering his mention of ""market value.""
* **Urgency and Relationship:**  By expressing my desire to close the deal, I'm creating a sense of urgency while maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is the maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more, accepting at this point secures a substantial profit.  

Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,900,000 represents a healthy profit margin above my minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. Accepting now guarantees the deal and eliminates uncertainty.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows me to reinvest the capital and potentially generate further returns, rather than prolonging negotiations.

While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the certainty and substantial profit make accepting Bob's offer the most strategic decision at this stage."
