Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,190,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances he'll be willing to pay a premium."
