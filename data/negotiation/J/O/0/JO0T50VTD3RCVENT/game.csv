"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,300,000 represents a significant discount considering its true worth. I could meet you halfway at $1,200,000. It's my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,050,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is tempting, I can't accept anything below $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,075,000. That's my final offer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
