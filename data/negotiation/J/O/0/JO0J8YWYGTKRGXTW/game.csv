"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $20000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? I think that's a fair price for this product.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $18000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $19000.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $19000. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $17500? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but unfortunately, $17500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $18500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $18500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18500 and $15000, which would be $16750. Would you be willing to accept this price? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",16750.0,Bob,6,
