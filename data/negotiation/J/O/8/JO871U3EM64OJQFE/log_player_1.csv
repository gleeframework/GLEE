"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to build some goodwill.
* **Leaving Room:**  This allows for several rounds of negotiation before I need to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **There's time for counteroffers:**  We're only in round 2, and I have several more rounds to try and negotiate a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  John's offer is my best option if I can't get a better deal from Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price that's above my minimum. 
* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm emphasizing the need for a mutually agreeable price to encourage further negotiation. 
* **Keeping some margin:**  A price of $11,500 still provides me with a significant profit, while giving Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? That would be a fair compromise, and we can both close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing too much time with further negotiation. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Accepting Bob's offer now might create a good relationship for potential future deals where I could potentially get a higher price.

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on the opportunity completely."
