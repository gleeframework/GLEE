"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $500,000? That feels like a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and settle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $650,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're serious about finding a fair deal, and I respect that.  How about we make this really simple and meet in the middle at $625,000?  That feels like a win-win to me.",625000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $625,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'll offer it to you for $675,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me.",675000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we might not find common ground here.  I'm willing to go to $637,500, but that's my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",637500.0,Bob,8,
