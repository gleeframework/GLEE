"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our unique product to you. It's an extraordinary opportunity that could significantly impact your business. Before we dive into the specifics, I'd like to extend an exclusive invitation to you. Considering its value to you, I propose we start with a price of $1400000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget.  You want to save as much money as possible, so it's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm looking to get it for closer to $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to meet somewhere in the middle, I would like to suggest a revised price of $1375000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering both the value of the product to you and my need to maximize the sale price. I look forward to your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is still higher than my ideal price. However, I'm willing to keep negotiating since it's closer to my desired price.  Rejecting the offer keeps me in the game and gives me another opportunity to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,375,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects our both our needs.  I'm ready to move forward with a price of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product to you and the current market conditions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $1325000. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise or even walk away. Additionally, if I continue to reject offers, I risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John for a higher price. 

Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price within my budget and saves me the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
