"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price, let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, well above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the potential benefit to Bob, even though I'm asking for more than he thinks it's worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not making it a take-it-or-leave-it offer. This encourages Bob to counter and keeps the negotiation going.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has come down from his initial value, but he's still $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **The Importance of My Minimum:**  Remember, I need to make at least $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. 

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial one. I'll aim to find a price point that's still appealing to Bob while ensuring I don't fall below my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial price.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair, even though it's still higher than Bob's offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm reminding Bob that we both stand to benefit from a deal.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum, but I'm also trying to maintain a balance. If I were to drop significantly lower, it might make Bob think I'm desperate and make him less likely to concede further.

**Next Steps:**  I'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll continue to adjust my offer in the next rounds, always keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is moving closer to my minimum, but he's still $50,000 below it.  
* **The Importance of My Minimum:** I need to make at least $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually beneficial price, so I'll continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. I need to make sure I don't give away too much, but I also want to show flexibility and keep the negotiation moving forward."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point. While $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's directly in between Bob's last offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this offer as a final one, which might incentivize Bob to accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Benefit:** I'm reiterating that this price allows both of us to benefit from the deal.

**Reasoning:**

* At this point, I'm close to my minimum price. I don't want to go lower, but I also need to be mindful of the time constraint and the possibility of selling to John. 
* This offer allows me to potentially close the deal without going through more rounds, but I'm still prepared to continue if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but he's still $20,000 short. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  I've already reached my minimum acceptable price, and John is willing to pay my minimum. 

**Reasoning:** 

* While I can continue negotiating with Bob, it's getting risky.  There's no guarantee that he will accept my counteroffers, and I might end up with less than I want.  
* Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum goal. It's a safer option with less risk.

**Next Steps:**  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him. It's the most secure way to ensure I achieve my financial goal."
