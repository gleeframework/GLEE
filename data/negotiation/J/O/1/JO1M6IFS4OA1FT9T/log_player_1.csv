Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly value your willingness to compromise.  While $1075000 is a significant step closer, I'm still slightly over my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1025000.
