"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer to what I can do, I'm still a bit over my limit.  I'm happy to offer $1050000. This is a significant step towards a deal, and I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my original asking price.  Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly value your willingness to compromise.  While $1075000 is a significant step closer, I'm still slightly over my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1025000. This is a final push from my side, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
