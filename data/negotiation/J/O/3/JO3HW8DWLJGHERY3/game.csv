"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to find a better price for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to consider my offer.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,550,000.  This price reflects the product's value and provides us both with a fair deal.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to consider my revised offer.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
