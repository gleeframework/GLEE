Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. Can you consider $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $10,750 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,750. Additionally, I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront, as you suggested. Can we meet at $10,750 and I'll pay the full amount immediately? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's offering to pay upfront, $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, so I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,900, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll try to get a bit closer to my target price. Can we meet at $10,700? I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront, as before. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's offering to pay upfront, $10,700 is still too low for me. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try to make one more counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible.  I'm willing to meet you one last time at $10,800.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. If you don't accept this offer, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,800. I'm willing to meet you at $10,600, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'm not sure if buying from John is my best option. Can we meet at $10,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. 

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, I'm running out of time and the negotiations haven't been productive. It's better to secure the sale to John and get $10,000 than to risk losing both Bob and John."
