Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't go above $12,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I will reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is not willing to budge on his offer, and I've already made a significant concession. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, John's offer is my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
