"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer you a great deal at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is still too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation.  We want to see how flexible Alice is and aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal at $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, which is good, but we're still only $200 away from John's price.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're splitting the difference between Alice's latest offer ($10,200) and our previous counteroffer ($9,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price at $9,750, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a deal at $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice went up in price, likely indicating she's not going to budge much further.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. We can secure the product from John for $10,000, saving us money and guaranteeing the purchase."
