"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1000000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
