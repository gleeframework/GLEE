Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'll find immense value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $12,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first is strategically sound.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, ensuring you stay above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the offer as exclusive to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a backup."
