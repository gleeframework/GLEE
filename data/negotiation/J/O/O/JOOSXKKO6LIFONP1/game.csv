"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value the product brings to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $760,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll sell the product to you for $820,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",820000.0,Alice,5,
