"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This is a fair price that's closer to my target and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
