Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This is a fair price that's closer to my target and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While I could continue negotiating, $1,075,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal without risking losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
