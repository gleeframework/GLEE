"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal considering the value it brings. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price that recognizes both our interests.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still working within my budget constraints. Could we agree on $8,750 for the product?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I'm still willing to work with you, but $8,750 just doesn't cut it.  Let's split the difference again - how about $8,875? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer carefully. I would like to propose $8,800 as the price for the product. This is my final offer.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $8,800 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle at $8,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come to an agreement. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8900.0,Alice,7,
