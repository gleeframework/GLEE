"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer close to Alice's minimum, knowing she's willing to sell for at least $10,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying but also pushes for a good deal. It's a strong opening move that sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it's closer to his target, it's still not a good deal. Bob is motivated to keep negotiating, hoping to get a lower price from Alice. There are still rounds remaining, and  Bob has the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise but also holding firm to his goal of saving as much as possible.  This counteroffer is a fair compromise, considering Alice rejected Bob's previous offer. It shows Bob is willing to meet in the middle, but still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still too high.  Bob has already made a counteroffer and is willing to keep negotiating, trying to secure a better deal. The option to buy from John for $15,000 provides a safety net, but Bob wants to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's likely selling point, demonstrating a commitment to reaching an agreement. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize savings. With fewer rounds remaining, Bob wants to get closer to a deal but avoids jumping to a price he's not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's target, it's still slightly higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob is willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a price closer to $11,500.  There are still rounds left, and he has the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is approaching the point where he may need to consider buying from John. With fewer rounds remaining, he needs to be more aggressive. This offer is a significant jump from his previous offer, showing Alice that Bob is serious about closing the deal but also that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  It puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  The risk of rejecting this offer and being stuck with John's price is too great.  Bob has already made a significant effort to negotiate and is now at a point where it's more financially prudent to secure the product from John at the higher price rather than risk losing out entirely.  This is a strategic decision based on the limited remaining time and the potential for a failed negotiation."
