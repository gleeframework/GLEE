Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000),** meaning you'll make a good profit.
* **It's lower than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000),** meaning he'll likely still see value in purchasing it from you. 

By offering this price, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible outcome while leaving some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer."
