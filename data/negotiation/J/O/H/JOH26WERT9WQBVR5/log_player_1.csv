``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It gives Bob an incentive to consider the offer while also allowing me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $600,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
