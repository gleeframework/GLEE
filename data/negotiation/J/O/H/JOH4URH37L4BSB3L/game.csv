"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer you $750,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant reduction, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it gives you a good return on your investment. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. I'll counteroffer $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
