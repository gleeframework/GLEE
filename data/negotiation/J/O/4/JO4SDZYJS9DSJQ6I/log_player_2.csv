"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and value, we believe it's worth $120. Considering your appreciation for the product, how about we agree on a price of $100? This would still be a great deal for you while allowing us to fairly compensate for our efforts and costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than John's, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $90. This price would still allow you to make a profit while giving me a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
