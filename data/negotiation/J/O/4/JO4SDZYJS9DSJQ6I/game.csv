"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and value, we believe it's worth $120. Considering your appreciation for the product, how about we agree on a price of $100? This would still be a great deal for you while allowing us to fairly compensate for our efforts and costs.",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $90. This price would still allow you to make a profit while giving me a good deal.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
