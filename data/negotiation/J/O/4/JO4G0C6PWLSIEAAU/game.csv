"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I'm definitely interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,000.  This reflects the true value of the product for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a fair offer. However, I'm not willing to go down to $12,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,750. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
