Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I aim for a price as close to my minimum value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $800,000.  This means he has a significant gap to cover.
* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,400,000. This signals my seriousness and leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

By starting high and having a backup buyer, I'm in a strong position to potentially achieve a good deal with Bob while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Improvement:** While I want to maximize my profit, I haven't exhausted all negotiation options.  There's room for me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a solid fallback option, so I don't need to rush into accepting a low offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, aiming to bridge the gap and potentially secure a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My previous offer of $1,400,000 was rejected, so I'm lowering my price by $50,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  By offering $1,350,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant profit. This counteroffer might be appealing to Bob as it's a significant increase from his last offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still refusing to accept Bob's initial offer.  This keeps the pressure on him and encourages him to consider my counteroffer seriously.  

By strategically adjusting my price and maintaining a firm stance, I aim to push Bob closer to my target price while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's only a $50,000 increase from his previous offer, which shows he's not willing to budge much.
* **Potential for Improvement:** While I'm open to negotiation, I believe there's still room for improvement. John's offer of $1,500,000 is a strong fallback, so I don't need to rush into a deal that's not beneficial.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm going to counteroffer again with a price closer to my desired range.  This shows continued commitment to the negotiation while trying to maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**  I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price higher than his current offer but lower than my previous one, aiming to find a middle ground that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Act:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between my previous offer of $1,350,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,250,000.
* **Final Push:** I'm lowering my price by $50,000 to show continued flexibility and encourage Bob to consider a deal closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Last Chance:** I'm making this counteroffer a serious attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer and move on.

By making a final counteroffer that's still profitable for me, I'm hoping to entice Bob into accepting a deal before I secure a more favorable price with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 remains significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. It's clear he's unwilling to budge further.
* **John's Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a guaranteed profit that's significantly higher than what I'm likely to get from Bob, even after further rounds of negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I'd like to maximize my profit, continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that we won't reach an agreement.  Accepting John's offer eliminates that risk and ensures a secure and profitable sale.

**Conclusion:**  Given the stalemate and the certainty of John's offer, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
