Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it can be of great value to you. I'm asking for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it at $12,000 provides a significant saving for him while securing a $4,000 profit for Alice (compared to selling it to John for $8,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is already attractive, starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, potentially leading to a still profitable deal for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going too close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) might seem greedy and deter him from accepting the offer."
