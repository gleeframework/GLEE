"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds intriguing, $900000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750000, given my budget and the need to find the right value. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which would allow me to close the deal within my budget. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
