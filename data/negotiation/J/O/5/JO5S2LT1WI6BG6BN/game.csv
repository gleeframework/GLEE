"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end, and I want to be sure we're not getting bogged down in small increments. This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.  Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a substantial concession, reflecting my desire to see this deal through with you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on your valuation, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll pay $1,450,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll need to explore other options, including buying from John for $1,000,000.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
