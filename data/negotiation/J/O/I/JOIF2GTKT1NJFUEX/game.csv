"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $140.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $130. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a reasonable price for both of us, I believe.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $115 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you a price of $125. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $120? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $125, Bob. I think we've been close, but I need to make a profit. I'll stick with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept.",125.0,Alice,7,
