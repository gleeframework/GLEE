"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still gives you a significant benefit over your estimated value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference closer to your last offer, say $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
