This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and understand his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's, it's still below your ideal price. There's room to negotiate further with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired amount, it's still not enough to justify selling it. There's room to negotiate further and I'm not willing to give up that much potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price with another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired value. While it's still lower than I'd ideally like, continuing to negotiate might risk losing him entirely. At this point, accepting his offer is the best option, as it maximizes my profit compared to selling to John."
