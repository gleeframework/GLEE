"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,900. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",10900.0,Alice,5,
