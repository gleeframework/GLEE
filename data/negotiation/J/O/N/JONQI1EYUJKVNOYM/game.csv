"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss a price closer to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer,  $1800000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1900000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value your continued interest in the product, but $1750000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1850000, a price that reflects the exceptional value and potential of this product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. Let me know your decision.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
