"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price, but I'll see if I can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is still a good value for you considering the product's worth. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15750? It's a fair price that's within my budget and closer to your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'm prepared to sell to John if we don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm going to meet you halfway on this one. How about we settle on $15,500? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $15250? It's a reasonable compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $15,000.  There's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, and I don't want to take that chance.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
