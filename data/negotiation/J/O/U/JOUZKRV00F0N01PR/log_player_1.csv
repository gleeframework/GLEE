Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, taking into account the potential returns I expect to see. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to our desired price point, but we're not at a point where accepting his offer is better than taking John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  We need to push Bob a bit further to see if we can secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,725,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price is fair considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to meet our minimum price. He's moving in smaller increments now, and we risk losing John's guaranteed offer if we continue to negotiate with Bob. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John at this point."
