"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, but also sets a clear value that reflects the product's worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate.  Bob knows the product is worth more to him, and this is a good opportunity to test his commitment.  By rejecting, I can explore if he's willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $8,000 is significantly below what it's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like more, $9,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my goal than John's offer, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  It's a good deal for both of us."
