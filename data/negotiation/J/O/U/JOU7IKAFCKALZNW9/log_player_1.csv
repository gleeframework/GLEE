""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for you. 
* **Justification:** Framing the price around ""fairness"" and Bob's potential ""return on investment"" makes it seem less arbitrary.

**Why not go higher?**

While Bob values the product highly, exceeding $1,300,000 might make him balk, especially without knowing the details of his financial situation. This price point leaves a significant profit margin while still being enticing to Bob."
