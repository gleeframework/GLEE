"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm confident this product is worth more to you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12500. This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product and gives us both a win.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $12500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000,  which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
