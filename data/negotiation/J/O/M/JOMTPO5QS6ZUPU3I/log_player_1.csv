"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a premium. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the uniqueness of the product to emphasize its potential value.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he rejects the offer, his counteroffer will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product.
* **Adjust my strategy:** I'll use this information to either make a counteroffer or, if his offer is significantly lower than my minimum, I'll choose to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $10000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While I can sell to John for $10,000, I'm not satisfied with that price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has acknowledged its value. This suggests there's potential for him to raise his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain some control and potentially secure a higher price in the next rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer,  hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.
* **Close the deal:** I'll keep negotiating strategically, using my knowledge of Bob's willingness to pay and my own minimum price to arrive at a satisfactory deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm confident this product is worth more to you.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product and gives us both a win."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers to him, making a compelling case for a slightly higher price.
* **Win-Win Approach:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing the benefits for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next move, whether he accepts my counteroffer or presents another counteroffer.
* **Adapt My Strategy:**  I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on his reactions, aiming to find a price that maximizes my earnings while securing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $12500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000,  which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:** Bob has raised his offer, which shows he's serious about the deal and recognizes the product's value. However, $11,000 is still significantly less than my initial offer and my desired price.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:**  I'm confident we can reach a more favorable agreement with a few more rounds of negotiation.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to keep control of the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a middle ground closer to my desired price.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'll continue to negotiate strategically, considering Bob's increasing willingness to pay and my minimum acceptable price, to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $11,500,  which is a fair compromise,  and we can both be happy with the deal.  It's a great price for a product like this, and it will save you time and effort in the long run."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Toward Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's slightly higher than Bob's latest offer but significantly lower than my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that this is a good investment and a smart move.
