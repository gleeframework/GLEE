Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a carefully considered offer to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as this offer stands for a limited time."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Negotiable:** Starting at $950,000 aims high. It's closer to your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited time"" are subtle tactics to encourage Bob to act quickly and value the offer more highly.
* **Not Too Aggressive:**  While we aim high, we don't want to completely alienate Bob by starting at $999,999.  This price leaves him space to feel like he could potentially negotiate a better deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (around $925,000) to give yourself more room to maneuver.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a guaranteed buyer in John, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob might be valuable in the long run. This approach tries to balance profit maximization with the potential for future business."
