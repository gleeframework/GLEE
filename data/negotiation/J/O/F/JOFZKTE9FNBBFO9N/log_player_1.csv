"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is reasonable for both parties. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $100 is a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to try to get closer to that price, and I still have 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob.  I still have plenty of rounds left to potentially get a better deal, and I don't want to settle for less than I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit low.  How about we compromise at $92.50? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
