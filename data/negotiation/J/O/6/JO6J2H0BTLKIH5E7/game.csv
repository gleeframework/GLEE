"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of a price more around $900,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? This price would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $950,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to get the product at a price you're comfortable with, and it allows me to earn a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
