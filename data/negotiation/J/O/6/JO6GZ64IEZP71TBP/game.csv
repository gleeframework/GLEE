"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair profit.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
