Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves me with a profit. This offer is high enough to potentially entice Bob while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still leaves me with a comfortable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is too low.  It's getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that is too far below what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John instead."
