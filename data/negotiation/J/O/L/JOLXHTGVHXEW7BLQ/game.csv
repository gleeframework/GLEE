"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible opportunity! I'm looking to sell a unique and valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm thinking of starting with a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1500000. I'm sure this product is valuable, but given my budget, I'd be willing to offer $1000000 as a starting point. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're serious about making a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1100000, which would be $1200000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1150000, which would be $1175000. That's my final offer. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,7,
