Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss a price of $1,200,000, which is my minimum, or $1,200,000 - $100,000 = $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I think we're getting close, though. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my minimum, or $1,200,000 - $250,000 = $950,000, but I'll go a bit higher than that. How about $1,100,000, or $1,050,000? I think we can find a mutually beneficial price somewhere in between. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
