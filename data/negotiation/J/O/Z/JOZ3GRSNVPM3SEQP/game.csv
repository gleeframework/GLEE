"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
