Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's still a decent profit for me. I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm willing to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price. If Bob rejects this offer, I might be willing to lower my price further, but I'm not going to sell for less than $160."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is higher than John's offer, and it's within my acceptable range. I'm willing to accept it and finalize the sale."
