"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll see if Bob bites, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,000,000 is far too low. I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm coming down a bit, but still aiming for a healthy profit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to go too low."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for more. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I believe this offer is a fair compromise and hope Bob will see it that way."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  I've made a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
