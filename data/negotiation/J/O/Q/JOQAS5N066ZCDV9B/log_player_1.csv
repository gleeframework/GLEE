Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your minimum selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he intends to negotiate down, his counteroffer might be higher than if you had started lower. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps understand how far Bob might be willing to go. His response will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's aggressive counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to get a bargain. There's space to negotiate toward a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is a backup:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You don't need to accept an unfavorable deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $15,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $3,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but not desperation.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $15,000 offer keeps you well above your $12,000 minimum, ensuring a profit if accepted.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""true value"" reinforces its worth and counters Bob's attempt to undervalue it. 
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is genuinely interested in negotiating or simply aiming for an unreasonably low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $11,000 is above your minimum selling price of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's willingness to move closer to your price range suggests he's serious about the purchase.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation might push Bob away, especially since you already have a guaranteed $12,000 from John. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing both buyers. 

While you could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk of losing the sale isn't worth the potential for a slightly higher profit.  Accepting $11,000 is a solid outcome."
