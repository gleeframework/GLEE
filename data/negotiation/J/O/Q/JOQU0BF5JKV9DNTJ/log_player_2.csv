It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  You can offer a price closer to your limit of $1,000,000 and see if Alice is willing to budge."

I'm offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. This gives us a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high. I'll make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to keep the price as low as possible. This should hopefully be a good compromise."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but there's still some room for negotiation. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."

I'm offering my maximum price, which is the same price John is selling the product for. I'm hoping that Alice is willing to accept this, as it's still a good deal for her considering her valuation."

Alice is clearly not willing to budge any further.  At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This is the best deal I can get, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially miss out on the product."
