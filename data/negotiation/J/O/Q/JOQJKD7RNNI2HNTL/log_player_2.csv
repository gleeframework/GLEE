"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a price closer to $8,500, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the best I can do at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

Alice has lowered her price to $9,200, which is a good deal for Bob. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will refuse further offers, leaving him to buy from John for $12,000. Accepting Alice's offer at this point ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price."
