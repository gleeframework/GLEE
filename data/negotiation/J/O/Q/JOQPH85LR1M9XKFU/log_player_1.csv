"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a very valuable asset that could be highly beneficial to your company. I'm open to negotiating, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking for something within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1400000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant amount of money, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John right now would leave a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1425000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,425,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the current offer. The product's worth to me justifies a few more rounds of negotiation. Selling to John at this point wouldn't be a smart move, as I could potentially earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a slightly higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,440,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product."", ""product_price"": 1440000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my situation, Alice. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $1430000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,430,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,430,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob has consistently shown willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to my desired price. While $1,430,000 is still slightly lower than my initial offer, accepting it at this stage is the most practical decision. It ensures a sale within my acceptable range while leaving room for potential further negotiation with John if this deal falls through."
