Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor.  While Bob's perceived value is lower, this approach aims to shift his perception towards the higher end.
* **Sense of Urgency & Competition:** Mentioning ""another interested party"" creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob, making him more inclined to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. This allows you to potentially secure a price higher than John's offer."
