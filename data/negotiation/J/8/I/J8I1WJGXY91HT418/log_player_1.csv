{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm going to reject it. I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This is still above my minimum, but it's a more realistic price based on Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing this sale. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $14,000."
