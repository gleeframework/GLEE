"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product,  $1200000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000, which is my maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $900000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,
