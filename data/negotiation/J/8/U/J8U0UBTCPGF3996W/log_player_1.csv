"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This should encourage him to negotiate while leaving room for me to decrease the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the price, but I was hoping we could come to an agreement closer to $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
I'm offering a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose $10,000 as the price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'm not yet ready to settle for $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,250?  This would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm offering a price that's a small compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer.  This signals I'm serious about closing the deal, but still have room to negotiate slightly."
