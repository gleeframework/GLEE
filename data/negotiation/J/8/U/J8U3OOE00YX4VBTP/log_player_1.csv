"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still being significantly more than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get the same price from John, and I don't want to lose out on potentially getting a better price from Bob in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $13,000. This is still a good deal for him and a reasonable compromise, given he initially offered my minimum. I'm hoping he'll see this as a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $12,500. While it's better than his initial offer, I'm still hoping to get a better price, especially since I have several rounds left. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $13,500.  It's a small increase from my last offer, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise but still need to make a profit.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him into accepting the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000.  This is a good price for me, considering my minimum was $12,000, and I only have 4 rounds left.  There's a chance Bob might offer more later, but I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $12,000."
