"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still below my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Alice. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I still cannot meet that price. I would like to propose an offer of $925,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",925000.0,Bob,4,
