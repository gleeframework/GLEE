Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit considerably above my minimum acceptable price.  

**Why this strategy?** 

* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $1,000,000 gives Bob the feeling he can get a better deal, which encourages him to engage in negotiation.
* **Secure Profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down to $900,000, I'm still earning more than my minimum. 
* **Avoid Delay:** It's better to test the waters with Bob than to immediately go with John, as I might miss out on a better price if Bob is willing to negotiate.

Let me know if you want me to continue the negotiation after Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,000,000. I would like to propose an offer of $900,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is better than his initial assessment and closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm still confident I can achieve a price closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Understanding Bob's Limits:** Bob's counteroffer reveals his willingness to negotiate, which indicates there's room for further discussion.
* **Avoid Selling Too Low:** Accepting Bob's offer would be a significant drop from my initial offer and might set a bad precedent for future negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his. This will show flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still below my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's proposed price. It signals my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profit.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** Aiming for the midpoint between our previous offers creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes my desire to reach an agreement while acknowledging Bob's financial limitations.

**Outcome:**

This counteroffer will hopefully push Bob towards accepting the deal.  If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate strategically until I either reach a satisfactory price or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Alice. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I still cannot meet that price. I would like to propose an offer of $925,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close.  

**Here's why I'm accepting:**

* **Significant Profit:** Even with this offer, I'm still earning a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing the negotiation could lead to further concessions from both parties, potentially resulting in a lower price. There's also a risk that Bob might withdraw from the deal altogether.
* **Time Factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more time I lose and the greater the chance of a better opportunity arising with John. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed with the sale to Bob at $925,000. This is a solid outcome, and I can always try to negotiate better prices in future transactions."
