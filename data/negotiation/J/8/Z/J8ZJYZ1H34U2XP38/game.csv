"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.

This is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your business or personal life, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident it will bring significant benefits to your business or personal life.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
