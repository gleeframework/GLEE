Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that will yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below her guaranteed price from John creates a strong incentive for Bob.
* **Bob's Perspective:** While $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000), there's a chance he might see potential upside or factors not initially considered, making the deal appealing.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a risk Bob could reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer eliminates the risk of ending up with no sale.

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value.**
2. **Maintain a safety net with John's guaranteed offer if Bob declines.**"
