Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for potential negotiation and a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It gets straight to the point without being overly aggressive. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response!"
