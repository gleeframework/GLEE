"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be feasible?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
