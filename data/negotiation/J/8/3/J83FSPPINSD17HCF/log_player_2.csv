"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a low number, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. Even if Alice rejects it outright, it sets a benchmark for future offers. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it can bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that be feasible?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Slowly:** This counteroffer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate upwards, but we're still significantly below her current price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're getting closer to our ""walk-away"" point of $8,000 (John's offer). Alice might be more willing to negotiate as we approach that threshold.
* **Maintaining Communication:**  We continue to express our interest and appreciation for her willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting close to your limit, but she's still asking for $1,500 more than John's offer. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are likely less than the risk of Alice walking away. You're better off securing the $8,000 deal with John."
