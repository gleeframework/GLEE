"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer ($1,300,000) slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Justification:** I frame the price as a ""fair starting point"" to avoid alienating Bob while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to pay a premium for the product. I'll aim for a price closer to $1,200,000 before considering accepting or walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm splitting the difference between his counteroffer ($1,100,000) and my previous offer ($1,300,000). This signals a willingness to compromise but also holds firm to a higher price point. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value and positioning this price as a ""fair compromise.""  
* **Continuing Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging Bob to stay engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  We are now only $50,000 away from my ideal price range. With 6 rounds remaining, I'm willing to push a little further and see if he'll budge closer to $1,200,000. The risk of losing the deal at this point seems low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we land on $1,180,000? This recognizes the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Higher:**  I'm proposing a price point ($1,180,000) that's closer to my target while still offering a concession from my previous offer. 
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using phrases like ""we're getting close"" and ""willingness to negotiate"" to create a positive atmosphere and encourage a deal.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm highlighting that this offer reflects both his initial offer and the product's inherent value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not quite there, Alice. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,120,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a price closer to $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $1,120,000 is still a substantial profit. Continuing to push for a higher price carries the risk of him walking away. It's time to secure the deal and avoid leaving money on the table."
