"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,100,000. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,700,000? This price reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to consider a final offer.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,550,000?  This would be a final offer on my end.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
