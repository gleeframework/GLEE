"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $90? I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
