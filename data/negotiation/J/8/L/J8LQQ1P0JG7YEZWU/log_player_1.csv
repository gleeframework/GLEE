Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $15,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. If he's willing to negotiate down from this point, it suggests the product holds significant value for him.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above his perceived value of the product ($8,000). This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $9,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's offer of $12,000.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can propose a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to your desired outcome while still keeping Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer presents a firm stance while still appearing reasonable.  It conveys that you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a substantial loss.
* **Anchoring to John's Offer:** By proposing $12,000, you're subtly anchoring the negotiation to your alternative option. This subtly reminds Bob that you have other options if he doesn't find this offer acceptable. 
* **Potential for Acceptance:** While it's higher than Bob's initial offer, there's a chance he might accept to avoid losing the deal, especially if the product holds a higher perceived value for him than his initial offer implied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Compromise:** While $10,000 is less than your ideal price, it's still a significant profit over Bob's perceived value and a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a higher price, but also risks Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a solid profit. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Prolonging the negotiation with Bob means potentially missing out on a sale to John. While John represents your minimum acceptable price, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
