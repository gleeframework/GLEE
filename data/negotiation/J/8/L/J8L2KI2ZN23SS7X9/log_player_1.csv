Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get closer to the product's true value to me.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant gain over Bob's perceived value. 
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" I'm adding perceived value and potentially encouraging a quicker decision. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting that the product's worth to Bob is considerably more than his perceived value aims to justify the high price.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
