{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to make a deal at that price 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about $90, I was thinking more like $87. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $90, $87 is still a decent price, especially considering that John is only offering $80.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to risk losing the deal altogether."
