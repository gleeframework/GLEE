"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $100.  While this is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than $100, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He's willing to pay $90 and can still get a good deal from John for $120 if he needs to.  There's room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $92.50, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $93? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $93, which is just $3 more than Bob's ideal price of $90. It's a good deal, and it's likely that any further negotiation will be difficult. It's a better deal than buying from John for $120."
