"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $92.50, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $93? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",93.0,Alice,5,
