I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is the price I would get from John, so it's the best possible outcome for me. While it's more than the product is worth to Bob, there's a chance he'll still accept, as he may be willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll simply sell it to John for the same price."
