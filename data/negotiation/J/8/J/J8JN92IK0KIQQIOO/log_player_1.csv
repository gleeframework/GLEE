Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **Above John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer, ensuring that selling to Bob is always the more profitable option if he accepts. 
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message aims to be confident in the product's value without being overly aggressive."
