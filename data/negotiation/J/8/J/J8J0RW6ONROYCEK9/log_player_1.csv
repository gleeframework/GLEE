Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but no more than that. Can we meet at $12,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob has met our minimum acceptable price, matching what John offers. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** We achieve our goal, getting our minimum price. It's a sure thing.
* **Rejecting and Countering:** There's a chance Bob might go slightly higher, but also a risk he walks away. We have limited rounds left. 
* **Selling to John:** This is now equally viable to accepting Bob's offer.

Given the time constraint and Bob meeting our minimum, the safest option is to accept:
