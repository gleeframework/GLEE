"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this great product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $140 is still more than Bob's maximum price of $150.  It's worth negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $130?  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $137.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $137.50 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his goal of $130 or lower.  There's still room for Alice to make a profit, and Bob has time to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $137.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $138, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal with Alice.  Alice has clearly set a firm price, and Bob is within a reasonable range of his budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's better than buying from John and only slightly higher than Bob's last offer."
