I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $140, still above my minimum value, to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's above my minimum value and closer to my desired price.  While selling to John would be a better outcome, the risk of further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price."
