"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can proceed to purchase the product from John for a much more favorable $800,000."
