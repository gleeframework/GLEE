Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like you're willing to compromise.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we want to maximize profit, offering it at $140 ensures that even if Bob negotiates a bit, you're still likely to get a price significantly higher than your $150 backup offer from John.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John."
