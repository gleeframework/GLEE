{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is $20 more than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also framing it positively, highlighting the product's value and being open to discussion."
