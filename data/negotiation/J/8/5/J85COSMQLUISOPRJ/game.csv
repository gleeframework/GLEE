"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer of $11,000, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,750. How about we do $12,125? This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12125.0,Alice,7,
