"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is my best price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm not sure I can go any lower than my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $12500 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging.",12500.0,Alice,9,
