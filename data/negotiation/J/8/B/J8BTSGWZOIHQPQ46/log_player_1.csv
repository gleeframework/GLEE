"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering the potential benefits you'll realize. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  The potential value of the product to Bob suggests there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm not able to go as low as $850,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This price still allows me to achieve a good return while recognizing the value the product holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you consider $875,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a sale. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially with only 6 rounds remaining."
