"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what John offers.  It's best to counter-offer and start negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $7,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000) leaves room for negotiation but signals that $12,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to move on price and set the tone for further bargaining. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have the option to walk away and buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations stall."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $9,000 is still more than your $8,000 limit and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left to negotiate. Alice coming down to $9,000 indicates a willingness to bargain.

Let's see if we can get Alice closer to $8,000 in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Your Limit:** You're now offering your maximum price. It's important to be firm at this point.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  You're emphasizing fairness and a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Deadline Approaching:** While there are rounds left, stating your firm offer now increases the pressure for Alice to decide."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500. You've done well in the negotiation, but she's holding firm.
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John's standing offer of $8,000 is a better deal than the $8,500 from Alice.
* **No Guarantee of Success:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice has no guarantee of getting you a better price, and you risk losing out on John's offer if you wait too long. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed saving by buying from John."
