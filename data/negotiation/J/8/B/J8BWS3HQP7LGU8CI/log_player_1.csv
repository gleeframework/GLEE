Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can get closer to $7,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.
