Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get a good price for myself.

{""product_price"": $120}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not too greedy, so I'll start with a relatively modest increase of $20. Let's see how he responds!"

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $90. I'm not thrilled about it, but I'll consider my options.

Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, I'm not going to accept his offer at $90. It's too low, and I want to get a better deal.

I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.
