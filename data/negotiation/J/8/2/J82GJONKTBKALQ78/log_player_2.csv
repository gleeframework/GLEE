"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. There's a chance you can secure a better deal, even if you end up buying from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening move, making it clear that I'm serious about buying the product but have a firm limit.  It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, which may encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is even higher than her initial offer, indicating she's not willing to negotiate significantly.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation with Alice."
