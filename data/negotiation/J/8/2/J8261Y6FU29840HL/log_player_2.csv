"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  Accepting this offer saves him $4,000 compared to buying from John."
