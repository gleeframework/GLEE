"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full minimum price, allowing Bob to feel like he can get a good deal.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary, while always keeping in mind my minimum price of $12,000. I'll also be watching for signs that Bob is willing to negotiate and be ready to counter his offers. I can always switch to John if negotiations stall or if I feel I'm not getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is too low, his message indicates he's willing to negotiate. This opens the door for counteroffers and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 provides me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I will also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering $9,000, I'm proposing a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob (""great deal"") and emphasizing the progress made towards an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual approach to see if I can get closer to my minimum price.  I'm also keeping the door open for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of your product, I am still looking to keep the price at $8000. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer to $8,500, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob's message shows he's still willing to negotiate, and his offer is closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safe option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a low price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll be prepared to make a counteroffer or even walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of my product while allowing you to stay within your budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering again:** I'm showing flexibility by counter-offering again.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" and ""acknowledging the value"" of the product.
* **Addressing Budget:** I'm referencing Bob's budget concerns to show understanding.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

* **Negotiation still possible:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and his offers are getting closer to my minimum.
* **John is a safe option:**  Having John as a buyer gives me the flexibility to reject offers that don't meet my minimum price.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit below where I need to be. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering again:** I'm showing that I'm still willing to negotiate and find a compromise.

* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offers, showing that I am serious about reaching an agreement.  If Bob still rejects this offer, I might consider lowering the price again, but I'll be watching for signs that he's truly willing to meet me halfway.  If negotiations continue to stall, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your efforts to reach a fair deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $9,500 is an improvement from his previous offers, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Although Bob has called this his ""final offer,"" his willingness to negotiate thus far suggests he might be willing to budge further.
* **John is a safe option:**  Having John as a buyer gives me the flexibility to reject offers that don't meet my minimum price, even if Bob says it's his ""final"" offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum price of $12,000.  I'll try to be persuasive but also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $9,500 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.

* **Stating the ""finality"" of my offer:**  By saying ""This is a significant compromise from my previous offers, and it shows that I'm committed to finding a solution,"" I'm implying that this is my final offer.

**Strategy:**

This is my final counteroffer before considering selling to John. I'm pushing as hard as I can to reach a deal with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** This is the final round, and while Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000.
* **John is the Safe Option:**  I know I can sell to John for $12,000, which is a guaranteed profit and ensures I meet my minimum price.  
* **Potential for Lower Counter-Offer:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll increase it further.  There's a risk that he might offer a lower price or refuse to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the risk of a lower counteroffer from Bob, I've decided to take the safe route and sell to John for $12,000.  This ensures I get the best possible price for my product and avoids any potential losses."
