(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?

Alice's offer:

This is a good price considering John's offer and Alice's ""final offer"" stance.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield much better results."
