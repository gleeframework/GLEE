"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great value given its potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downward while still potentially exceeding my minimum value. 
* **Positive Framing:**  My message is optimistic and focuses on the value proposition to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Setting a Clear Expectation:**  The offer clearly states the price I'm asking for, setting a starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Prepared for Rejection:** I'm ready for Bob to reject this offer, as it's likely he will.  This is just the first round, and I have room to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer that is more in line with my expectations. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** By continuing the negotiation, I keep the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 open. I can assess if Bob is willing to come closer to my value or if I should take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too far below my desired price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing your interest in the product. I believe this price reflects the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Setting a Clear Expectation:**  I'm stating my current asking price to keep the negotiation focused. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving the door open for further counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the potential risks and rewards involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm not yet ready to settle for such a low price.  I still have time to make counteroffers and potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **Keeping the Option Open:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 open. This provides me with a safety net and a benchmark for acceptable prices. 

I'll continue to try and bridge the gap with Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if the price doesn't get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down further to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm continuing to show flexibility by lowering my price again, but staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Closing the Gap:**  $850,000 is closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Urgency:** I use language like ""Let's see if we can close this deal"" to subtly add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can consider moving closer to his price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary.  

This counteroffer aims to create a sense of urgency and pressure while still being within my acceptable range.  The goal is to either secure a deal with Bob or push him closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I understand this product holds significant value. How about we settle at $780,000?  I'm eager to finalize this and believe this offer represents a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I have 4 rounds remaining and haven't yet reached my minimum price, so I'm not under significant pressure to accept.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting this offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. There's still room for a counteroffer that could be more appealing to me.
* **Safety Net:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 remains my fallback position.  I can still accept that offer if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome.

I'm still hopeful that I can get Bob to agree to a higher price, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $800,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and the offer of $780,000. It's getting closer to where we need to be.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to come down to $820,000.  This price reflects the unique value of the product while demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 820000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $820,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's also close enough to Bob's offer to potentially create a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message remains positive and focuses on a ""win-win"" scenario, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have two more rounds to either secure a deal closer to my target or accept John's offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** By suggesting ""finalizing the deal,"" I subtly emphasize that time is running out, which could encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired price range and encouraging Bob to make a decision."
