Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value ($10,000) than Bob's ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $9,500 allows for potential compromise and leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much.
* **Positive and open tone:** My message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a discussion, making him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can likely get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. I'm confident Bob sees value in the product and may be willing to pay a bit more to secure it.
* **Minimizing risk:** While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering allows me to potentially maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of this amazing product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Offering $9,000 is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good starting point for a potential deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob why it's worth a slightly higher price.
* **Open to discussion:** I leave the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts."
