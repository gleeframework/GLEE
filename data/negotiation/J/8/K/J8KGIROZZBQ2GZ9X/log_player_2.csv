"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown a willingness to pay $800,000, so there's potential for a middle ground. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm thinking of a price of $840000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown he's willing to pay $825,000, so there's potential for a compromise closer to that amount. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's meet in the middle at $830,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 830000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $830000. I'm thinking of a price of $835000. This is a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to Bob's desired price.  $835,000 is only $5,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and it's significantly lower than Alice's original offer.  With only three rounds remaining, it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a good price.  Furthermore, buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a worse outcome."
