"I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your compromise, $14000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer it to you for $13500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
