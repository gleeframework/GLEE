"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **John's Offer:** $100
* **Your Maximum:** $100

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, you know you can get the product for $10 less from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with her or simply buy from John and save money."
