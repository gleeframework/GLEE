# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While I believe the product is worth more, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether, leaving me with John's lower offer.  It's a good deal at $1,280,000."
