{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives you the opportunity to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $8500 is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price of $8,500. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get a lower price, $9,000 is a fair price and getting closer to my target. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a higher price."
