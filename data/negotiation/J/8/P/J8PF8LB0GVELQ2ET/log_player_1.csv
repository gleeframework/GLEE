Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is more than your $10,000 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:**  $11,500 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand. 

Let's see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial price. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, as he's clearly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:** $11,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000.
* **Open to further negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to discuss further. This keeps the door open for a successful deal."
