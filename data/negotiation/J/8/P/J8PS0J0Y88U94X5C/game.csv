"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
