Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me leverage in the initial stages.
* **Reasoning:**  I've included a justification for my price, highlighting the value to Bob. This can help him see the value and be more receptive to the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** A $50,000 gap between my price and Bob's perceived value gives him space to counter without feeling like he's losing too much. 

**Important Note:**  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails. This is my fallback option and provides a limit to how low I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,100,000 is still above my minimum, it's not a good enough price for me. I'm confident I can do better.
* **The Importance of Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage. This shows him I'm not desperate for a deal and encourages him to come up with a more favorable offer.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe there's a good chance I can counteroffer and get a price closer to my desired $1,150,000.

**Next Step:** I will proceed to the next round and send a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my position.
* **Encouraging Closure:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, trying to make Bob feel like accepting this offer is the best way to move forward.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum price, so I'm not risking losing too much money.

**Next Step:** I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to re-evaluate my position and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
