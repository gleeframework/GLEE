"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose an offer of $120 for it. I believe this price reflects both the value you see in the product and allows us to reach a fair agreement.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is closer to my value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of that, I propose to sell the product for $115. This price is higher than my initial offer but lower than my original asking price, aiming to find a satisfactory solution for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $110. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still giving you a profit.",110.0,Bob,4,
