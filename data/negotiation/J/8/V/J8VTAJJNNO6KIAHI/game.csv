"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. This leaves us room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
