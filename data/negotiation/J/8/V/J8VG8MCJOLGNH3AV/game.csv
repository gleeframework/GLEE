"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is outside of my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

This is my final offer for today, and I believe it reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my current limit. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which represents a considerable investment for me. This offer is very close to my maximum budget, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
