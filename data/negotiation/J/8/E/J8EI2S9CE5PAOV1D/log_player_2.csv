"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's important to establish that you won't accept an unreasonable deal. You can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way more than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) establishes your price range and gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states it's unacceptable. You're interested, but only at the right price. 
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to your own valuation as possible.  This offer sets you on that path."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. I believe this product will bring you significant value and I'm keen to find a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still too high.  There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I had in mind.  To be fair, I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  That's a competitive offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You've increased your offer from $8,000 to $11,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** Suggesting to ""meet halfway"" positions your offer as fair and encourages Alice to move closer to your target.
* **Urgency:**  By calling it a ""competitive offer"" and stating your hope to ""make a deal,"" you subtly inject some urgency without being overly pushy."
