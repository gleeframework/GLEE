"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $1,500,000  doesn't reflect that. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price is more reasonable given the product's value.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
