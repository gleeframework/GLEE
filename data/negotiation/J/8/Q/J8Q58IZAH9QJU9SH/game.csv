"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference and go with $125.  I think that's fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, but I still think $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
