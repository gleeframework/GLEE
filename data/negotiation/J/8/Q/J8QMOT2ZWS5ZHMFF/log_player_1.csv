"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($150) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Attractive Offer:** $175 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $120.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the opportunity to get a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, but I'm setting the tone for a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  While Bob's offer is low, I'm willing to continue to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Not desperate:** I have a backup option in John who's willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $140 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($140) and my initial offer ($175).
* **Still Profitable:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm using language like ""fair price"" and ""value of the product"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a bit of urgency with the phrase ""Let's close this deal!"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below $150. 
* **Room for compromise:** There's still a small window for negotiation.  I can try to push for a slightly higher price.
* **Avoiding selling to John yet:** Selling to John at $150 is a guaranteed outcome, but I want to explore whether I can get a slightly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $145 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $155. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm positioning this offer as a final compromise, signaling to Bob that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Near Minimum:** $155 is only $5 above my minimum price, making it a reasonable offer for both of us.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer met minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, while continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with nothing.
* **Time constraint:** We've already had five rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will offer more.
* **No further gains:**  Continuing with Bob offers no potential for a higher price, while selling to John ensures a certain profit."
