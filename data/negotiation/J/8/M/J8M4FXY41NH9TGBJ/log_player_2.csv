"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. This is a great deal, as it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.
