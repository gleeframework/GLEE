"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I have 9 rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This represents a good deal for both of us and allows for a profitable agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal. I'm happy to accept Bob's offer of $1,500,000. This is the minimum I was willing to accept, and it secures a sale within a reasonable number of rounds."
