"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This represents a good deal for both of us and allows for a profitable agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay under my $1,500,000 limit. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
