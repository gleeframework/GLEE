"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This represents a good deal for both of us and allows for a profitable agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget.  This represents a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
