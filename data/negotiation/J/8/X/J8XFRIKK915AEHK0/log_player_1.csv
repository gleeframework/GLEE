"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong position and gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $2,000,000 offer provides a cushion for negotiation while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to maintain a collaborative and positive tone throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from my initial ask, indicating potential for a higher final price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit, I'm willing to negotiate further to maximize my gain.  I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to $1,900,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is attractive, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the product's potential benefits for you."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer and my previous ask, signaling a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's benefits specifically for Bob, reinforcing its worth and justifying the higher price.
* **Maintaining Positivity:** I'm keeping the tone collaborative and respectful to encourage a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still feel that $1,800,000 would be a fair price given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking close to his initial offer and seems less flexible than I hoped. While $1,750,000 is a good profit, I'm concerned that accepting now will leave money on the table. I'm willing to push a bit further, but I'll need to carefully consider my next move, as I don't want to scare Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be mindful of the product's true value. Would you consider $1,850,000?  I'm confident this represents a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($100,000 instead of $75,000), signaling that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Final Offer Tone:**  While not explicitly stating it's my final offer, I'm implying a sense of urgency and finality in my wording. 
* **Focus on ""Win-Win"":**  I want to emphasize that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial deal and not trying to take advantage of Bob. 

**Strategy Going Forward:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Next Move:** If Bob rejects this offer or counteroffers below $1,800,000, I will likely accept his next offer, as I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Consideration:** With each round, the risk of Bob walking away increases. I will need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal as we get closer to the 10-round limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I truly appreciate your effort. Considering my budget, I propose $1,750,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is holding firm at $1,750,000.  Continuing to push for a higher price significantly risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,750,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum. It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk walking away with nothing.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  The longer this drags on, the higher the chance Bob loses interest or finds an alternative."
