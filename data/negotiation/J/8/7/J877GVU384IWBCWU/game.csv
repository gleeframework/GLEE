"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it would be a win-win situation. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I understand the product's value to you, but I'm really pushing my budget at this point.  Let's try $9,000 as a final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
