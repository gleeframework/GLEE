Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, implying that you'll list it publicly suggests it has value beyond your asking price.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $12,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
