# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm not convinced it's the best deal, and I'm confident I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a bit better than her first one, but still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get a lower price, so I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John for $15,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer and I'll be left with no choice but to buy from John.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
