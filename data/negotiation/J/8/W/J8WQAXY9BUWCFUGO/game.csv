"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
