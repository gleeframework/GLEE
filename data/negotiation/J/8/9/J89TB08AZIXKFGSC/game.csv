"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,000. I understand that it's above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $14,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. I believe this is a reasonable price, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $13,000. I understand that you're trying to find a balance, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm not ready to compromise further. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing a new price of $14,500. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
