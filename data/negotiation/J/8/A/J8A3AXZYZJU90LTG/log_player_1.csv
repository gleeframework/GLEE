Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000.  This is a one-time offer."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($925,000) aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and seriously consider the deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000."
