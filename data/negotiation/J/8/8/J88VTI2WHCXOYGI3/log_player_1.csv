Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make the purchase and giving you a decent return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
