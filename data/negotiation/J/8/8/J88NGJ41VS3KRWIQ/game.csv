"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming closer to my budget, Alice. I appreciate the compromise.  How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to accept $10,000 just yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
