"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware that I have a safety net with John, so I'm not afraid to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,600,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for a higher offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,600,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of at least $1,800,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,700,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and accept.  If not, I'm still within the range I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good offer from Bob, and it's getting close to my ideal price.  I'm happy to accept $1,650,000 and close the deal.  It's important to remember I have John as a backup if this deal falls through, but this is a good price and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
