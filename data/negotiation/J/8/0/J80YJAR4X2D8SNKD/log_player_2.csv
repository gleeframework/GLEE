Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $950,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot in between.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $920,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer. $870,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.

It's time to accept the offer. Alice is consistently meeting in the middle, and we're now at a $300,000 discount from her initial offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal, especially considering we're getting close to the halfway point of our negotiation rounds."
