"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
