Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $100, there's a chance to get even closer to my product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below my minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. It creates a sense of urgency and a ""deal,"" making it more tempting for him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially earning me even more."
