"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. I believe it could significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is significant, and I believe my initial offer reflects that worth. Let's meet halfway; I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant to commit at $1,300,000. I believe a price of $1,250,000 would be fair for both of us. It's closer to my target, and it leaves some room for us to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. Let's settle this right now - I'm prepared to accept $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
