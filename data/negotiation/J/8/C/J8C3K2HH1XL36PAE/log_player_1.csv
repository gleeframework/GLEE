Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Given the value to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
