"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $10,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13000 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is only $2,000 more than what you initially offered. It's a good deal for you, considering you're willing to pay up to $15,000. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you might end up buying from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure this deal and save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
