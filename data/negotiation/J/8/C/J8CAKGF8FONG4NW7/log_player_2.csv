"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. By offering $9,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still pushing for a better deal. This counteroffer is a reasonable step down from Alice's initial price, making it likely she'll consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still hoping to get it lower. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  The risk of continuing is that Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further or raise her price even more.  However, the potential reward of a lower price outweighs that risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's moved up slightly from his previous offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a better deal than $9,800.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and might be acceptable to Alice, who is likely willing to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,750, which is very close to Bob's ideal price point.  At this point, it's more likely that further negotiation will result in a higher price than a lower one.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal for Bob and prevents him from risking further negotiation with a chance of having to buy from John for a higher price."
