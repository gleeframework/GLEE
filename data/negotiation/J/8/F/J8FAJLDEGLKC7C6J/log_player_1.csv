Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it to be very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. While $13,500 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $14,000, $13,000 is still a good deal for me and allows me to avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price. It's also a reasonable compromise, showing that we both are willing to move closer to each other's positions."
