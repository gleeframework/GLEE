"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget at $9,250.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,750? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,5,
