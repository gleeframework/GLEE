"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice. $9,000 is still a bit more than the product is worth to you, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget.  There's still some room for negotiation, so it's worth seeing if you can get her down a bit further."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still not willing to go down to $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice has come back to her original offer of $9,000, and while it's not the absolute best price, it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $10,000. It's worth accepting to secure the product and save some money."
