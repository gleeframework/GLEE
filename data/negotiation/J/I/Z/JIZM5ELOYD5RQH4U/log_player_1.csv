"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, at $17,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping he'll see the value of the product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I could take $12,000, it's far below what I want. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is my minimum.  This is a good compromise and still gives Bob a better deal than if he bought from John.  I hope he'll see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I'm also getting closer to my ""sell to John"" point, so the pressure is on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him $14,000. This is still a good profit for me, but I'm getting closer to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely. Hopefully, he'll see this as a fair compromise."
