Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $790,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.
