"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  That's a fair price that's close to what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can make this work.",15500.0,Bob,4,
