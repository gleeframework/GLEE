"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,400,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000? This acknowledges your interest while still reflecting the product's value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,650,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close the deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
