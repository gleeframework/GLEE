"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $15000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $18000, and that's my final offer for now. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I can do $17500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",17500.0,Alice,7,
