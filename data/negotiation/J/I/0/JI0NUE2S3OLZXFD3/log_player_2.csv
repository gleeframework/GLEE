(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $11,000, which is lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **You are willing to pay up to $12,000:**  You have stated you are willing to spend a maximum of $12,000, so Alice's offer falls within your budget.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
