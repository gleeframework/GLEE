"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $90, but no higher. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $90.  It's more profitable at this point to take John's guaranteed offer of $100."
