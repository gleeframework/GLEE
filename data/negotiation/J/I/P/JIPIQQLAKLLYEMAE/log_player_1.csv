Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do like the product, I'm not sure I can go that high.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $10,500?  This is my best offer, and I'm confident we can strike a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
