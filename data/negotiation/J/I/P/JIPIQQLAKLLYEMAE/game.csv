"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do like the product, I'm not sure I can go that high.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $10,500?  This is my best offer, and I'm confident we can strike a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $11,500 is my final offer.  It's still a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to you.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
