Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still slightly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $108.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5

Alice is clearly very attached to that $108.50 price point.  It's a decent compromise, and further haggling risks pushing Alice away entirely, leading to the less favorable deal with John."
