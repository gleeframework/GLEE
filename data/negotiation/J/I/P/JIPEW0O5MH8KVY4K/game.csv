"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $110 is closer, but I'm aiming for a bit more savings. How about we split the difference and do $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $107.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still slightly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $108.50. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",108.5,Alice,5,
