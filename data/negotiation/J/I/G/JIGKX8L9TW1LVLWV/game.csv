"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can work something out.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. It's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",125.0,Alice,5,
