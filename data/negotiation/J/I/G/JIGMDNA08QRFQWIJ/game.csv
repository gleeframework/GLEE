"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd find it really valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $60 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $100. I believe this product will really benefit you and it's a fair price for the value it provides. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the value, Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $70?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $85? That's me coming down significantly. It's a great deal!",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me.  How about $75 and we have a deal?",75.0,Bob,6,
