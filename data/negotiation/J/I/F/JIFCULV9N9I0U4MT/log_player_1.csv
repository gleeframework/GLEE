This offer is a bit above what Bob considers the product worth, but it's also significantly lower than my minimum value.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to work with you, but $122.50 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $126.25? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 126.25}
