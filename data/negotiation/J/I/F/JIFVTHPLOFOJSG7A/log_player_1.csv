Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is of incredible value, and I know you'd benefit greatly from it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it for $800,001 and be guaranteed a sale, aiming higher allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties, we introduce a time constraint, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This offer balances securing a deal with Bob against the guaranteed sale to John."
