Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 10 rounds and a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $13,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $13,500? Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $13500. How about $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, and I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $13,000.  How about $13,250? It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay above $13000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13250. How about $12625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,625 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000 and only four rounds left. I will continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,625 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need to stay above $13,000 to make this work. How about $13,125? That's a reasonable compromise, and it brings us much closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stay above $13000, but I'm really close to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13125. How about $12562.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,562.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,562.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are not progressing fast enough.  Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, so I'm better off taking that deal and securing a better price. There's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to meet my price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
