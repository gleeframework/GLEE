"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a fair price considering the value it holds. Let's try to find a compromise.",800000.0,Alice,3,
