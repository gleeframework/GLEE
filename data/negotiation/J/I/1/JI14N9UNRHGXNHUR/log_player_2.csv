Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $130 is still above your maximum price point, and you have several rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The price of $125 is within my budget and a good deal considering the product's value to me.  I'm happy to accept Alice's offer."
