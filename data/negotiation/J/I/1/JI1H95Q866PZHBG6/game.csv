"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the initial price of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in a product of this nature.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant departure from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
