"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive message can create a more agreeable atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:** This encourages Bob to respond and engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.**  I have room to negotiate with Bob, and I don't want to settle for a low offer so early on.
* **I'm not desperate.**  I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $130?  It's a fair price considering the value of this item."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer, showing him I'm willing to negotiate but not at his current price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $110 is a fair price for this product. Can you meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation room:**  We're getting closer, but I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Opportunity to increase:** I want to maximize my profit and there's still time to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a good middle ground. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm to my minimum while offering a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Finality:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal, putting a bit of pressure on Bob.
* **Middle Ground:**  $125 is a good middle ground between our last offers, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to meet you at $118. Can we finalize the deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $118 is not enough for me to sell the product. I'm unwilling to drop below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **I have a guaranteed offer:** I can sell the product to John for $120, which is a better deal than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the odds of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.  It's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
