"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1,400,000. Can we meet in the middle this time?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To show my good faith, I'm prepared to accept $1,500,000 for this. This is a significant reduction from my original ask, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I'd like to propose a slight reduction to $1,350,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,450,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession to $1,380,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering the value it will bring to my business. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1380000.0,Bob,8,
