"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to consider your offer. However, due to the high quality and unique aspects of the item, I can only accept offers above $80. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $82. This price reflects the value I place on the product while remaining mindful of your budget. I look forward to your response.",82.0,Alice,3,
