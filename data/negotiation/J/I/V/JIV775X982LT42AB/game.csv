"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a fair deal.  This product truly is a game-changer, and I believe this price reflects its true value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
