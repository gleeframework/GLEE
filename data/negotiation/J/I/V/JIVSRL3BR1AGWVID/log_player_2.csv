"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than what he's willing to pay, it's still a significant sum. It's worth exploring if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  $1,080,000 is closer to his target, but he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,070,000. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is only $20,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  While Bob would prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Alice has made it clear that this is her final offer, and if Bob rejects it, she might sell to John instead. 

At this point, accepting the offer is the most financially advantageous option for Bob. He gets the product for a lower price than John would offer, and he secures the deal."
