"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I value this product, but I have a limit. How about we start around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. Considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair deal considering the value and allow me to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. I believe we can come to an agreement on this.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need it to work within my budget. I can offer you $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase a similar product elsewhere for this price. Please let me know your decision.",800000.0,Bob,6,
