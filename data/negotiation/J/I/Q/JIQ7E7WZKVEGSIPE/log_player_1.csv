I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price before accepting."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm only $7.50 away from my minimum acceptable price, so I'll try one more counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $86.25? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 86.25}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $83? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

At this point, Bob is not willing to pay close to my desired price.  It's better to sell to John for $80 than to continue the negotiation.  While I want to get more, the risk of going through more rounds of negotiations is not worth it."
