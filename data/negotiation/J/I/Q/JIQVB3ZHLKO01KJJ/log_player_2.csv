Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,100,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind.  Could you consider $1,300,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.
