Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique attributes, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and might give the impression that the product is even more valuable.
* **Above Both Valuations:** The opening price is higher than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's valuation ($1,000,000). This creates a negotiating range where a mutually beneficial deal is still possible. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique attributes"" and ""true worth and potential,"" you're providing a subjective reason for the high price without explicitly stating your minimum.

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where you can potentially:
* **Secure a price closer to your asking price.**
* **Gauge Bob's interest level** based on his counteroffer.
* **Confidently walk away** to John's offer if the negotiation doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his own valuation but still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and you have the security of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $1,100,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind.  Could you consider $1,300,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's appreciation for the product and willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $100,000 from your initial offer shows flexibility but also signals that you're serious about a price above $1,200,000. 
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to your minimum while still leaving room for Bob to potentially counter again.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** The presence of John's guaranteed $1,200,000 offer gives you a strong bottom line in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal carefully. While I understand your perspective, I'm still not able to meet at $1,300,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Bob will go higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
