"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for you, considering the value you placed on the product. Let's find a middle ground here.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $14,000 is getting closer to what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500.  This allows for a fair profit for both of us, and lets us close this deal.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,250? This is a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",14250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $14,250 is a good offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  How about we compromise at $14,375? This is a small adjustment that still allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's close this deal now, so we can both move on.",14375.0,Alice,7,
