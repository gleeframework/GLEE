Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than John's offer, but still above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also shows him I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While $13,500 is a better offer than his initial perceived value, I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than he's offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, so that's the best option."
