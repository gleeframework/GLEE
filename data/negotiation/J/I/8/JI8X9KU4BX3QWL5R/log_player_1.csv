Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum price point.  This allows me to potentially maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the $95, I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm flexible, while also demonstrating that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now higher than my minimum acceptable price and it's quite close to my desired price point.  It's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly better offer."
