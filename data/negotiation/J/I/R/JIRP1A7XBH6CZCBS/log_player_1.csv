Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,100,000? This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a profit on this sale.  $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product and me to make a reasonable return."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll pay $975,000 for the product. Is that a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my goal if I continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $975,000 isn't quite enough for me to let go of this valuable product. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $1,000,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
