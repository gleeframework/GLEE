I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget and John's price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
