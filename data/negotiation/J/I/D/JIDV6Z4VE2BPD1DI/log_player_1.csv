Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $100, so offering it above that price is essential.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no need to go below that.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $140 leaves a little room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer enticing enough for Bob to accept."
