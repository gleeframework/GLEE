,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy your product for $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $80.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about $90? I'm really interested in your product, but I'm working with a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. $95 is closer, but I'm aiming for $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make the deal. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not budging from $95, Bob. I think it's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm confident that you'll find this product valuable and worth the extra $5.",95.0,Alice,7,
