"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also anchors the negotiation closer to a price point favorable to me.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message aims to maintain a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic:**  By starting low, I signal that I'm a serious buyer but also looking for a good deal. Alice will need to significantly justify her higher price if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,500. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $8,500 is still a significant markup from her $8,000 valuation.  There's room to negotiate further, especially since I have the fallback option of buying from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about $7,200?"",
""product_price"": 7200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move upward, but in smaller increments than her previous concession.
* **Staying below $8,000:** My goal is to secure the product for less than Alice values it.  This offer keeps the pressure on her to justify a price above that point.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm still mindful of the $12,000 option with John.  Negotiating too slowly might push Alice away, so I'm balancing aggression with the need to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now met her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal. Accepting at $8,000 secures a significant discount compared to John's $12,000 price."
