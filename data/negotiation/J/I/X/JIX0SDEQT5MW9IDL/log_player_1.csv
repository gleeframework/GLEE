Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident this product will be a significant asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $600,000 is far too low. I'm willing to work with Bob, but I need to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide. To be honest, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000 if that gets us closer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $650,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still far too low. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $650,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to $1 million. How about $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
