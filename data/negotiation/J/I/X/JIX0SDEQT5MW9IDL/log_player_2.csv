"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm confident this product will be a significant asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, and it reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide. To be honest, anything above $700,000 is pushing it for me.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000 if that gets us closer."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $650,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to $1 million. How about $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you. She's still significantly over your budget, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
