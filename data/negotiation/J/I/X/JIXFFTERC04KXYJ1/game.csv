"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this exceptional product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
