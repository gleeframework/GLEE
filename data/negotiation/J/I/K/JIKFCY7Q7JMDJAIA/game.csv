"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer takes into account the potential return on investment this product offers and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering both my budget and the product's potential.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
