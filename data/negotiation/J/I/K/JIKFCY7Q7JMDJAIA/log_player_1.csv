"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is positive and invites Bob's input, indicating willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:**  His reaction will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be. 
2. **Anchor the negotiation high:** Even if Bob rejects the initial price, it sets a higher reference point for further negotiation. 
3. **Maintain the option of John:** I can always accept John's offer later if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, I have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation for a chance to secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, I believe the product's unique value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer takes into account the potential return on investment this product offers and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  I've lowered my price by $300,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the new offer of $2,000,000 is still substantially above Bob's offer, keeping me closer to my target.
* **Focus on Value, Not Budget:** My message reiterates the product's ""unique value"" and potential ROI, subtly shifting the focus away from Bob's stated budget constraints. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price point closer to the middle of the current range ($1,200,000 - $2,300,000). This signals a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. 

By making a substantial counteroffer, I'm gauging how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how much he might be willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering both my budget and the product's potential.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation or potentially alienating Bob by pushing for a higher price. Accepting this offer secures me the desired profit and a successful deal."
