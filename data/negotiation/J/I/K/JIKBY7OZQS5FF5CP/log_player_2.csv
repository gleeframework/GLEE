You can get the product for a lower price than $140. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go up to $142.50

You're still better off trying to get a lower price.  While $142.50 is closer to your goal, you can still try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a persistent one, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $138, and that's as low as I'm willing to go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $138 is the best you've gotten so far, and it's still below your maximum price of $150. It's time to accept and move on."
