,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $80. If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to look at other options.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller.",90.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,9,
