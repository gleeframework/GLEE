"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns about budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9800. However, I'm not willing to go that low.

"I appreciate your willingness to make another adjustment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer $9900 for the product. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9900.0,Bob,8,
