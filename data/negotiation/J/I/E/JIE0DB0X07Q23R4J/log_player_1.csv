Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Polite and Open Approach:** The message is framed positively and suggests a willingness to discuss, making it more likely for Bob to engage. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value.
* If we knew more about Bob, we could adjust our offer and message accordingly."
