Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more than $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $12,000 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still increase the price if Bob accepts, or lower it slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is still above your minimum price of $8,000, and it's likely he won't go higher. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale rather than risk him walking away or you having to counter-offer and potentially lower the price further."
