"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere closer to my original offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? That would still give you a healthy profit and would be a great deal for me. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,020,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,010,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to make a healthy profit while ensuring I get a great deal. Let's get this done!",1010000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,030,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $1,030,000.",1030000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I hear you, and I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really keen on getting this deal done, but I'm still not quite there at $1,030,000.  How about we meet in the middle, at $1,020,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both live with. Let's make this happen.",1020000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000, which is just a small increase from your last offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
