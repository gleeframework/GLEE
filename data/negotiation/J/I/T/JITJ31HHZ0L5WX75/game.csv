,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $75. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $82 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about we split the difference and go with $80? That's fair to both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a good price, but I'm not willing to give up on getting a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $80. How about we try $81? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
