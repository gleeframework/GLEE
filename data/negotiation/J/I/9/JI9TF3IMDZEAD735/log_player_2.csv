"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000. There's a significant gap, and it's worth negotiating to try and get a better price.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can bring her down closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the realm of possibility that Alice might accept. It leaves room for further negotiation and signals my seriousness in purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from $18,000, $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm determined to keep the price below $12,000, as that's my absolute limit. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm very close to my budget limit. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still trying to push the price down, but I'm also showing flexibility by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Alice's. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, hopefully increasing the chances of a deal."
