"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target:** $13,000 is a significant improvement from her initial $14,000 offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers and he'd be forced to buy from John for $15,000.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Alice's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing she's willing to negotiate.

At this point, accepting the offer secures a good price for Bob and avoids potential risks of further negotiation."
