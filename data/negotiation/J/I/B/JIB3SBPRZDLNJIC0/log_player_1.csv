"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm going to start with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer instead of walking away."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $1,250,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds.  We're getting close, and I'm confident I can secure a deal closer to my desired price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best I can get.  I believe we can reach a compromise closer to $1,350,000 in the next few rounds. I'm also feeling confident because Bob has been steadily increasing his offers, which suggests he's really interested in the product."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a compromise that we can both agree on. If this doesn't work, I might need to start considering selling to John.  However, I'm still optimistic that we can reach a deal with Bob."

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I would have liked to get closer to $1,350,000, I'm  confident that  this is a good deal. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal with Bob and earn a significant amount of money."
