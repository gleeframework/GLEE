"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair price that allows me to save and you to still make a decent profit.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
