"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in it based on my needs.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects a more realistic compromise while acknowledging the unique value this product offers.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,400,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant step forward from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. I'm hoping we can find a compromise closer to this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I can offer $1,000,000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually acceptable price within our remaining rounds. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
