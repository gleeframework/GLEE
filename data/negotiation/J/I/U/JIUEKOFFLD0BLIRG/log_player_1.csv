"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $12,000, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal. We'll see if I can push Bob further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,800.  This is still below Bob's stated value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while staying close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's a strong move, and hopefully, it'll be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,600 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get.  I'm taking it to secure a good deal and avoid risking further negotiation."
