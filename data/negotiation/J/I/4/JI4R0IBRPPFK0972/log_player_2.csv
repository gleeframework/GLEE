Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this works for you.

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and the price of $1,350,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield much further decrease and risks pushing Alice away from the deal."
