You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

You can do better than $95. You'll counteroffer and see if Alice will come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $85.  How about we split the difference at $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and $90 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  You'll counteroffer again and see if you can get Alice closer to your desired price."
