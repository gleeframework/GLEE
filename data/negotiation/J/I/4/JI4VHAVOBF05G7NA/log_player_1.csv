Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for your consideration.  I believe it's a valuable asset that aligns perfectly with your needs.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, reflecting the product's value and the potential benefits it offers you.  Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm highlighting the value and benefits of the product to Bob to make the price more palatable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating that I'm open to negotiation, setting the stage for a back-and-forth conversation.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away from the deal if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay $800,000, that's significantly less than what I consider the product to be worth, and even less than what John is offering. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I can potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This allows me to keep the negotiation alive and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too far below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  This price reflects the product's true value and the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm dropping the price to $1,000,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his range. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the entire value of the product. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reinforcing the value and benefits of the product to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Set a limit:**  I'm making it clear that $1,000,000 is the minimum I'll accept. 
* **Open to compromise:** I'm using language like ""meet me halfway"" to suggest a possibility of a compromise.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** While John is a backup, I'm not willing to sell for $1,000,000 to him right now. This counteroffer gives me a chance to close the deal with Bob at a better price. 
* **Leveraging the negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer and proposing a counteroffer, I'm maintaining control of the negotiation and showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for a price far below the product's value."
