"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too far below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.  This price reflects the product's true value and the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
