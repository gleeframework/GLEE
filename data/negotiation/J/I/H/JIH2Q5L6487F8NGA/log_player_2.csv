"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I do see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $850,000 for it, which still gives you a good profit and is a more attractive price for me."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's still a good deal for Bob, as he's saving $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
