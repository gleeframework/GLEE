"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I do see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to offer $850,000 for it, which still gives you a good profit and is a more attractive price for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",875000.0,Alice,3,
