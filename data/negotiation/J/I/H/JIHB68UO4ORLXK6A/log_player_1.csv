Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding ""limited time"" creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer knowing his perceived value is much lower. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit before moving on to the guaranteed sale with John."
