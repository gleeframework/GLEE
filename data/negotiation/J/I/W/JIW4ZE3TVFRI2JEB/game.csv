"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price, considering my max budget and your own value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1350000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1300000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1325000, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
