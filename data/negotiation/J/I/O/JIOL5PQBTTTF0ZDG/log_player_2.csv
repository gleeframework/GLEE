"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer means you pay $14,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would cost you $15,000, which is more than the cost of buying from Alice."
