"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price.  Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're sticking to your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
