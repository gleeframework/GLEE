Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $12,000? That would work much better for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, we are still losing potential profit by entertaining his offers.  It's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark that John is consistently offering. Accepting his current offer would mean a $3,000 loss compared to John's deal, and further negotiation might not bridge that gap sufficiently.  Therefore, it's in our best interest to sell to John at this point."
