"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $12,000? That would work much better for me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
