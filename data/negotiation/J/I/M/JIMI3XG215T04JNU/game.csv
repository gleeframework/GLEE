"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 isn't quite meeting my expectations.  Considering the unique value this product holds for someone like you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still reflects the value it offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, and the limited time we have left to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the compromise I'm making, but it's still a price that reflects the unique value you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I'll gain from the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
