"Alice, your offer is far too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I'm sure we can reach a fair agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $22,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. While $18,000 is still my ideal price point, I'm willing to consider $15,000  as my final offer. This allows me to recoup a significant portion of its value.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
