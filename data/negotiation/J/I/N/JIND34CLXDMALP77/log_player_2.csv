Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $112 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $118? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extra value to sweeten the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut your losses.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $118, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation to save $2. John offers a guaranteed price of $120, which is acceptable within your budget."
