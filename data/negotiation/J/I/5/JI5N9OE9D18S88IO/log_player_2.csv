"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you prompt her to potentially offer a lower price. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $120."
