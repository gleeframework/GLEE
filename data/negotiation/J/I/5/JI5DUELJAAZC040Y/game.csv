"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $750,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $775,000, which is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
