# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $750,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $775,000, which is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's unlikely to go below $775,000.  At this point, John's offer of $800,000 is a better deal. It's better to secure the product at a known price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
