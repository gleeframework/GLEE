{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $100 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is my first offer to Bob. I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to him, but still significantly below my minimum price of $120. This allows some room for negotiation while still ensuring I don't sell it for less than I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is insistent on a price that's below my minimum. It's clear we're not going to agree, and I'm not willing to keep negotiating. I'll sell to John for $120, which is the best outcome for me."
