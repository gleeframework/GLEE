"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $130. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a discount from the product's value to you, it's still above your target of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to control the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $125 for this product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $127.50 for the product. This allows us to maintain a fair profit while still being competitive. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer, but still too high:** While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my target of $125.  
* **Further negotiation is likely:** I can likely get closer to my target with another counteroffer. 
* **John is still a backup:**  If the negotiations fall through, I can still buy from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $127.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $126.  That would be a great deal for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 126}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to you, we are willing to agree on a price of $126.50. This allows us to achieve a satisfactory profit while still providing you with a good deal. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:**  $126.5 is only slightly above my desired price of $125 and well below my maximum budget of $150.
* **Negotiating further might be risky:**  While I could try to get a slightly lower price, there's a chance Alice might walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's worth securing a deal within my budget."
