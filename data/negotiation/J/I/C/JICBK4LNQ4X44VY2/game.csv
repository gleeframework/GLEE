"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save some money on this deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However,  $1,050,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to compromise further,  but  $1,200,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This price reflects the true value of the product to you and allows for a win-win scenario. I'm confident this is a price that you'll find beneficial in the long run.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000. How about we try $1,075,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to my maximum budget.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
