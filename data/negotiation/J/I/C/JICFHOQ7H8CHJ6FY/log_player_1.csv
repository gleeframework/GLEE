{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can push him a little higher.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000 to meet you halfway. It's still a great price considering what the product is worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $12500 for the product. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's only $500 less than my last offer.  It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  It's better to secure the sale now than to keep negotiating and potentially lose him as a buyer."
