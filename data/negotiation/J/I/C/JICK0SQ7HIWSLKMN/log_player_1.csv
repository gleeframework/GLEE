Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,300,000, you set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he wants to negotiate down, it's less likely he'll go drastically below this initial figure.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps you gauge Bob's eagerness and potential budget. His response will provide valuable information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than both your minimum price and John's standing offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 for this to make sense for me. This product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident that you'll see an excellent return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down significantly from the initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, the new price is still substantially above Bob's offer, demonstrating that we're not desperate.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces its worth and justifies the higher price. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:** We're still in a position to accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet our needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I still think $1,000,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offer:** Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **No Further Gain with John:** John's offer is also $1,000,000, so there's no financial advantage to delaying.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
