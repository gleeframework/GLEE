"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we start with a significantly lower counteroffer. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This is still a great price for the value the product provides you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to our range, but we're still above our ideal price. We know John offers the product for $8,000, so we have leverage. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows us to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're strategically positioning our offer between Alice's last price and our safety net with John ($8,000).  By expressing a sense of urgency (""ready to close""), we might incentivize Alice to accept and avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer, but we're still above our fallback option with John.  We're in a strong position to hold firm and see if Alice will come down those final few hundred dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different vendor. "",
""product_price"": 8250
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're making a small concession to show willingness while still aiming for a price below our John's price. By introducing a ""final offer"" and the alternative option, we're increasing pressure for Alice to accept."
