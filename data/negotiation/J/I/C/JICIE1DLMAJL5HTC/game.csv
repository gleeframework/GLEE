"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This is still a great price for the value the product provides you. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,000. Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different vendor. ",8250.0,Bob,6,
