Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still secures a great price for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight for $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
