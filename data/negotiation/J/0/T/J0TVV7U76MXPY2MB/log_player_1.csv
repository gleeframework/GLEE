""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept anything less than $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation while staying above your minimum is the best strategy. 
* **The Offer:** $12,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down slightly if needed, while still securing a significant profit."
