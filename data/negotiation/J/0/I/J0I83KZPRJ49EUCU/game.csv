"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, allowing you to gain significant value and me to secure a strong price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1250000. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is simply too low for me. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still allows me to recover a reasonable portion of the product's value, while offering you a competitive price. I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and offer $1300000. This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable price, and I'm confident we can close the deal quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1325000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward quickly. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Let's try $1310000.  It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a final agreement.  I'm confident this will work for both of us.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but $1310000 is still not quite there for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1315000. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal right now.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1315000.0,Alice,7,
