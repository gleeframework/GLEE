"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its worth while also acknowledging your potential gains.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I'm looking to secure this product for a slightly lower price to maximize my return on investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the inherent worth of this product and its potential for substantial return. I'm confident that it can bring you even greater gains than you anticipate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This price strikes a balance between a fair value for you and a profitable acquisition for me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. How about $1,275,000?  This represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll see exceptional returns.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
