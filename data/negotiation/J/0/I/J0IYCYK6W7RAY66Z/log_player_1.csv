Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I'm looking to secure this product for a slightly lower price to maximize my return on investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 undervalues the inherent worth of this product and its potential for substantial return. I'm confident that it can bring you even greater gains than you anticipate.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,300,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This price strikes a balance between a fair value for you and a profitable acquisition for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,250,000 is a good offer, we are still early in the negotiation.  Bob clearly sees the value in the product. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,300,000."
