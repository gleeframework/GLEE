"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? This would still leave you with a good profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
