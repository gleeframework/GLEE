"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,250 is closer, but I'm still looking for a better deal.  How about we meet at $11,500? This price is fair, considering the product's value to you and my budget. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  To be honest, I have another potential buyer interested at a lower price. However, I value our negotiation and believe we can find a solution.  My final offer is $11,800. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is a fair offer considering the product's value.",11800.0,Alice,5,
