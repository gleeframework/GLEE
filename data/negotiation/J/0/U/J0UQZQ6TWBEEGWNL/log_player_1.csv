Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Minimum Value:** The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I won't accept anything less.
* **Potential Upside:**  I'm aiming for a higher price to maximize my profit. $1,500,000 is a significant markup, but it's a reasonable starting point.
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's no real downside to trying for a higher price.

This strategy balances the need to make a profit with the risk of losing the sale.  It's possible that Bob is willing to pay even more than $1,500,000, but without knowing his valuation, this offer gives me a strong chance of getting a good deal."
