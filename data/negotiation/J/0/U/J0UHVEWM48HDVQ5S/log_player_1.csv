Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount due to its quality and features. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($150 vs. $100), Alice aims to explore the possibility of Bob valuing the product more than he initially thinks.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides a cushion for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can gradually lower the price, still aiming for a final sale above her minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $100, her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy allows Alice to maximize her potential profit while minimizing her risk."
