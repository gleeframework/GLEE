This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a positive message that may encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8,000 is your current limit. However, that's unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. Would you be interested in $10,000? It's still a great deal considering the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less.  Would you consider $9000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to go higher."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $9,500? It's a fair price, and I'm hopeful that we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
