"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1500000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1400000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1350000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1380000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1320000. I think this is a more reasonable price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1320000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1350000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free consultation and a 6-month warranty. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1350000. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1290000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to accept it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
