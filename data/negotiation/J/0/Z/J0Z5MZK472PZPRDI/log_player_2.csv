# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can potentially get a better deal than $1,400,000, which is still above your maximum budget."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?
