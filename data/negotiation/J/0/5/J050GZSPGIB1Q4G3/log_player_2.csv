"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you. This product, tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations, is priced at $1,200,000. Given its significance to you, this offer represents a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value to you ($1,000,000) and my valuation of it ($1,500,000). I believe this price offers an excellent balance that maximizes the benefit for both parties. I look forward to discussing this further and exploring how we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is more expensive, even though she claims it's a ""strategic midpoint"". Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the better choice."
