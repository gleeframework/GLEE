"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $115 is a strong starting point, as it's close to my minimum acceptable value ($120) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Opening:** I start with a friendly greeting and a positive statement about the product to build rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I can always sell to John for $120 if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable value.
* **Reasoning:** I explain the reasoning behind my price, highlighting the value Bob will get and emphasizing my need for a price that's fair to me.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about $98? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $98 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120, even though it's closer.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $120."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $102. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I can make. I really value your interest in the product."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm lowering the price to $102, which is getting closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum value. I present it as my ""final offer"" to put pressure on Bob.
* **Compromise:** I emphasize the compromise I'm making to show good faith.
* **Value and Interest:**  I remind Bob about the value of the product and reiterate my appreciation for his interest. This helps maintain a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about $99? I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $99 is very close to my minimum acceptable value ($120), it's still below it. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is high.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is a safe and secure option given the uncertainty of reaching a deal with Bob.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, wasting valuable time and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John."
