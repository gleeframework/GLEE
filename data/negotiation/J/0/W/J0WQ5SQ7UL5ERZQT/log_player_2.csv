"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, you have room to negotiate further.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is a logical first step to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $95, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to accept a price closer to her own valuation of $80.  This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is still a good price,  Alice's counteroffer is higher than my previous counteroffer.  I want to see if I can get a better price, as I am willing to go up to $120. I am confident that we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my initial offer, but still lower than my maximum price. I am raising my offer slightly to $90. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to her valuation. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be accepted, as I'm getting closer to a reasonable price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is higher than my last offer of $90. However, it's still within my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating because I believe I can still get a better price. We've had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that's beneficial to both of us. I will try to get a price closer to $90 or a little above."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, but I am still willing to negotiate. I am raising my offer to $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $90 and her last offer of $105. This demonstrates that I am willing to compromise and meet her halfway.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Alice, and we can finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to my maximum price, but I'm still not happy with it.  We're approaching the end of the negotiations, and I want to avoid buying from John at $120.  I believe I can still get a better price from Alice. I'm hoping for a price closer to my last offer of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to my limit.  To avoid buying from John, I'm raising my offer to $100. This is a significant increase from my last offer, but still within my budget. It shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm also trying to get the best price possible.  I'm hoping that this offer will be accepted, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is getting very close to my maximum price. I'm only one round away from having to buy from John, and I'm not confident that I can negotiate a better price with Alice.  To avoid taking the risk of further negotiation, I'm going to buy from John for $120.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still within my budget and guarantees that I'll get the product."
