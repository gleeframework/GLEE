Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Based on our current discussion, I am willing to consider a price of $11,000 for the product. This is the highest price I can offer given its value to you and the market conditions. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could get it for $10,000 from John, Alice's offer is only $1,000 more and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price drop.  He's saving $500 compared to his last offer."
