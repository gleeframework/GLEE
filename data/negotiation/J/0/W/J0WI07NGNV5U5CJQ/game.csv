"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $16000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that this product is not worth more than $14000 to me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $14000. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $10000",14000.0,Bob,6,
