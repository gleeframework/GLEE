"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly approach can build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and provides an opportunity for him to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **More negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **No urgency:** I'm not under time pressure and have 8 rounds left to negotiate.  

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal for you, and still leaves me some room to make a profit. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm showing flexibility by counter-offering with a price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" for Bob to incentivize him to accept.
* **Setting a firm price:**  By specifying $105 as my offer, I'm establishing a clear target for the negotiation. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation positive."
