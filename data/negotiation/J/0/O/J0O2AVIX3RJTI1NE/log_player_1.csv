"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $925,000 remains out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This offer is a fair middle ground, and I believe it provides us both with a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move closer to my price point. While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can negotiate a slightly better deal.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to his but still above my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer to what I need to make this work.  How about we settle at $890,000? That's a small adjustment on my end, and I think it represents a fair compromise for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $890,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential savings for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer, he's still significantly under my $890,000 offer. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer.  If he doesn't meet my price this round, I'll take John's offer to avoid the risk of getting a worse offer or running out of rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. I value your interest and the time we've spent negotiating.  I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $857,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. "",
""product_price"": 857500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to balance firmness with a final concession. By splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while setting a clear bottom line.  If Bob rejects this, I'll accept John's offer to ensure I get at least $800,000."
