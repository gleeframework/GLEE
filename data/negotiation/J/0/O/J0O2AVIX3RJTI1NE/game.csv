"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $925,000 remains out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This offer is a fair middle ground, and I believe it provides us both with a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer to what I need to make this work.  How about we settle at $890,000? That's a small adjustment on my end, and I think it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $890,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential savings for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, this is my final offer. I value your interest and the time we've spent negotiating.  I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $857,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. ",857500.0,Alice,7,
