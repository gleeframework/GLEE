"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he should not accept an offer of $1,000,000. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the potential savings for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget of $800,000.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $925,000 remains out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which represents a significant compromise on my part. This offer is a fair middle ground, and I believe it provides us both with a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer to what I need to make this work.  How about we settle at $890,000? That's a small adjustment on my end, and I think it represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $890,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000. He can continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, but $890,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the potential savings for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. I value your interest and the time we've spent negotiating.  I can meet you halfway between our last offers at $857,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $857,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $857,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. There's only a limited number of rounds left. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John at his target price and avoid further negotiation."
