"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as $8,500 is significantly less than the $15,000 you're willing to pay. You can see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a good deal for me. I'm hoping to get a price closer to this, but I'm willing to go a bit higher if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better price. While $7,500 is closer to my ideal price point, I think I can still negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7250}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $7,250. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer is getting close to my initial counteroffer of $7,000. It's likely we're nearing a point where further negotiation won't yield much more savings, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer at $7,375 saves me over $7,500 compared to buying from John."
