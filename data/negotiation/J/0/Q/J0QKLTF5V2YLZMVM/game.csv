"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $130, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $115, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $125. This is my final compromise, so please let me know if it works for you.",125.0,Alice,7,
