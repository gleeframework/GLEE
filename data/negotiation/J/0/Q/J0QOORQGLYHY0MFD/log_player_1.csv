Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Starting High:** Starting with a higher price ($120) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential Loss:** While there's a chance Bob might reject the offer, the potential gain of selling it for $120 outweighs settling for the guaranteed $80 from John. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay. If you had more information, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
