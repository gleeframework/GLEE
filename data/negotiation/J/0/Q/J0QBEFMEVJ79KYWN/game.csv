"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $6,800. Would that work for you?",6800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $6,800. I'm willing to take a small step closer to your price. I'm offering the product to you for $7,200. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not ready to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. This is a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7100.0,Alice,7,
