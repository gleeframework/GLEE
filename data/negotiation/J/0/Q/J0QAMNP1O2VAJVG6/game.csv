"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to try to accommodate you while still ensuring a fair profit for us. How about we meet in the middle at $95 for the product?",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $95 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle on $85? That would be a great price for me, and I'd be happy to close the deal right now.",85.0,Bob,4,
