Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly lower than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $145.

{""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping to get, but it's still a decent offer. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, he's willing to pay a premium for it. I'll decide to reject his offer and proceed to the next round.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob that's slightly higher than his offer. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $135.
