"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I believe will be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, a price that I think is fair considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000.  There's a chance you can get Alice to lower her price further. By rejecting her initial offer, you create the opportunity for a counter-offer."
