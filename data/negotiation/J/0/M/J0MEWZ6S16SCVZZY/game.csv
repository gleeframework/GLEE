"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product a worthwhile investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,
