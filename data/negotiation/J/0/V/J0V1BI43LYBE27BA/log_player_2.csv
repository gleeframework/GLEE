"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This is a starting point for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to create room for negotiation and potentially secure a much better deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest while clearly indicating that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Roundness:**  Using a round number like $6,000 might make it seem like a more considered offer and potentially easier for Alice to work with. 

Now, we wait for Alice's response to see how she reacts to this counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice met us halfway, $9,000 is still above our $8,000 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Alice might be willing to go a bit lower, especially since she's eager to sell.
* **John Option:** We always have the safety net of buying from John at $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't lead to a favorable price."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $7,500?"",

}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We recognize and appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to her price while staying below our budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge how much further Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At the Limit:**  Alice is now at $8,500, which is still above our maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Unlikely to Budge Further:** Her last few concessions have been relatively small, suggesting she might not be willing to go much lower.
* **John is the Safer Bet:** We have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at our target price of $8,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice when we can get the product for our ideal price elsewhere."
