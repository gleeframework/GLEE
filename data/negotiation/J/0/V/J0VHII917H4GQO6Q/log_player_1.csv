I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can consider lowering the price slightly, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm willing to be flexible to secure a deal."
