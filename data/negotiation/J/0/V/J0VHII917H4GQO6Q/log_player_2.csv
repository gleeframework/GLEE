You should reject Alice's offer.  You are aiming for a price of $12,000 or less, and Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate further or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above your target of $12,000, but it's close enough that it's worth considering. You're not guaranteed to get a better offer from Alice in the next round. It's also possible that John could increase his price if you stall too long.  Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product at a reasonable price and avoids further negotiation."
