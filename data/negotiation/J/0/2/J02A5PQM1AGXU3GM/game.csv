"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $950,000 is still too low for me. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I am too.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price that would give us both a good outcome.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
