"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This approach gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I need to be flexible, I can't settle for such a drastic drop. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price while maintaining my negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 at this point. I need to keep pushing for a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $950,000 is still too low for me. I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I am too.  Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price that would give us both a good outcome.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
