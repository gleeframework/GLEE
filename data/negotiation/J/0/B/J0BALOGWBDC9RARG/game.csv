"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is tempting, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's as low as I can go.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $108 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's get this deal done.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Would you be willing to go down to $107? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John at $100.",107.0,Bob,6,
