"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob. $115 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
