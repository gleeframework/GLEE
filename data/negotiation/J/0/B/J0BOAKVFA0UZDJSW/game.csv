"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1500000. This represents a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts and counteroffers.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for a product of this nature.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1200000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come up to $1300000 to demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway, so I'm offering $1250000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that should satisfy both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
