"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10,750 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,250.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final compromise. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,5,
