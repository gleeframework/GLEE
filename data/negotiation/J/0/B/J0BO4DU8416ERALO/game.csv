"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget might be a little tighter, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  That's the most I can justify for this item.",80.0,Bob,4,
