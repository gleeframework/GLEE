Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in hearing more about it? I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I've started with a friendly opening and highlighted the value of the product to me. This helps build rapport and emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob. I've also kept the message concise and focused on getting Bob interested in the product.
* **Product Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000, which is higher than John's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. The ideal strategy depends on factors like your risk tolerance and how much you want to push for a higher price."
