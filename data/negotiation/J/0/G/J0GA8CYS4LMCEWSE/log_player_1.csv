Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm being upfront about knowing Bob's interest, suggesting I'm confident in the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate, encouraging him to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I should sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **John is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not in a desperate situation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than $10,000 but lower than my initial offer of $13,000. This will show I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **Still profitable:**  $11,500 is above my minimum price and allows for a decent profit.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for him, emphasizing the good price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy.  I could consider lowering my offer slightly more, but I'll also weigh the risk of losing Bob as a buyer against the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to pay that much for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While $11,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. It's likely I can get closer to $12,000 with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer is still an option:** If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $12,000, so there's no urgency to accept Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is slightly higher than $11,000 but still lower than my previous offer of $11,500. This will show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also confident in the value of the product. I'll try to push for a price closer to $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $11,000 is getting closer to where I need to be. Let's compromise at $11,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm raising the offer by a small amount ($250) to show I'm willing to budge.
* **Still Profitable:** $11,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and allows for a decent profit.
* **Finality:** I'm framing the offer as the final step to close the deal, implying there's no room for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $12,000. The risk of losing Bob as a buyer becomes higher with each round of negotiation, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached an impasse. Bob is unwilling to go higher than $11,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000.
* **No More Room for Compromise:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets both our needs.
* **John is the Safer Choice:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a minimum profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll inform Bob that I'm going to sell the product to someone else, as I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000.
* I'll proceed with selling the product to John for $12,000."
