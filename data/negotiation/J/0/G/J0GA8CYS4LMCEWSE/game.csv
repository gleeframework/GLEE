,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to pay that much for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and $11,000 is getting closer to where I need to be. Let's compromise at $11,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to pay more than that. Can you consider this price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
