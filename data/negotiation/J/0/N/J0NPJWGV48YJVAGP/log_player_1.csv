Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,350,000) anchors the negotiation higher. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely to stay above my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""potential value"" and ""return on investment,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** While I have John as a backup buyer, I don't want to reveal this to Bob. It weakens my negotiating position."
