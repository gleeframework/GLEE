"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe its value to you could be substantial.  I'm initially pricing it at $1500000.

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to my business. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a fair price considering its potential for your business.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1300000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
