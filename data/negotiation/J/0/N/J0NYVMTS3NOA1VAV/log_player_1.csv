Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it could bring to my business. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his interest, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe the product's value warrants a higher price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
