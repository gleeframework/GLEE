"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's higher than his target price of $8,000, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While it's closer to his target price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  There are still several rounds left, and he has the option of buying from John for $8,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $8,800?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only $900 above his target price of $8,000. It's unlikely he'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, especially considering he has the option to buy from John for $8,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures he gets the product while staying within a reasonable price range."
