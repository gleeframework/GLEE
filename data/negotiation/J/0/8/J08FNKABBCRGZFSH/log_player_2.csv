"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I believe is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get a better price, considering the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,100,000.  While there might be a slight chance of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal to John and paying $1,500,000 outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer ensures a good price and a successful purchase."
