"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can likely get it lower. You have a good buffer of $3,000 before needing to buy from John, so it's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $11,000, which is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's still worth trying to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $11,250, which is $250 more than your last offer. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good price considering your goal of saving as much as possible.  You have a significant buffer of $3,750 before needing to go with John's offer. While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer, leading to further negotiations and possibly losing the deal. 

Given the limited rounds and the potential for Alice to become less flexible, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price."
