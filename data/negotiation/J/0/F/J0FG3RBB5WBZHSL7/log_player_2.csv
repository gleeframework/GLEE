You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from Alice, as it's worth $1,000,000 to her. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's also significantly lower than the price you'd pay to John, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price. You're still significantly better off buying from Alice than John, so continued negotiation is the logical choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It also keeps the price significantly lower than Alice's current offer while still being a good deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. While it is higher than your last counteroffer,  the negotiations have moved closer to a compromise point.  It is likely that continuing to negotiate will result in a price that is closer to Alice's desired price than yours, so it's better to accept the current offer and secure the product."
