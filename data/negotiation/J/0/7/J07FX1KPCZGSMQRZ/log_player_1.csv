"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $10500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to accept $10750?  It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's clear that I won't be able to get my desired price from Bob within the remaining rounds.  John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not going to risk losing that opportunity."
