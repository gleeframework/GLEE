"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate that. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $825,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000, but I'm afraid that's still a bit short of my minimum. I've already considered selling to John, but I'd like to give you one last chance. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
