Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate that. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $825,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000, but I'm afraid that's still a bit short of my minimum. I've already considered selling to John, but I'd like to give you one last chance. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has explicitly stated she won't go lower than $825,000 and is considering other options. While you could push further, you risk:

* **Alice walking away:**  She might sell to John, leaving you with no choice but to buy at $1,000,000.
* **Wasting negotiation rounds:** You have limited rounds, and continuing to haggle for a small difference might not be worth the risk.

Accepting at $825,000 secures the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer."
