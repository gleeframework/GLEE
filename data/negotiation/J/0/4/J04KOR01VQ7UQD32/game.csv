"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm still a little high at $105.  Would you consider $95?  It's closer to my budget and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 100? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really appreciate the value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,5,
