Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $150. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would $130 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with $130. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round and see if we can finally reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $135? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to choose option (3) and sell the product to John for $150.  

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it seems like he's not willing to budge much more. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I'm worried I'll run out of time before I reach a price I'm happy with. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the safer choice."
