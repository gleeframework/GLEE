"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is my final offer. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,320,000. This is my final offer as well.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
