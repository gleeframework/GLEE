"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but I have a limit in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $11,000? This feels like a fairer compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
