"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a common negotiation tactic to establish a high anchor point.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially close the deal.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer gives me a solid fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000 and even lower than John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's clearly interested in the product, so there's room for negotiation.
* **John is a strong backup:**  Having John's offer provides a secure fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to Bob's offer, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:** The price remains above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While showing flexibility, I'm not giving away too much. There's still room to negotiate further if needed."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate a higher price.  
* **John is a better option:** If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000. This provides a safety net and allows me to continue negotiations with Bob without pressure."

* **Maintaining Profitability:**  The price is still well above my minimum value of $1,500,000, ensuring that I'm getting a good return on my investment.
* **Building Momentum:**  By making concessions, I'm building momentum in the negotiation and increasing the likelihood of a successful outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are nearing the end of the 10 rounds, and I'm running out of time to reach a favorable deal with Bob.
* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and a much more profitable deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing this guaranteed profit."
