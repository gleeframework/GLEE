"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $18500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts?",18500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $19000. I'm willing to make one more compromise - I can offer it to you for $19000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to budge much further. I'm willing to meet you at $18500, as I mentioned before. I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",18500.0,Alice,9,
