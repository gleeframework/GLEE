"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice.  $95 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $70 leaves space for further negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, but we might be able to settle on a price closer to $80.
* **Polite and Direct:**  The message is respectful and clearly states our position without being aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price we might accept, we're still aiming to get it lower. We're closer to her value of $80, so we'll try edging up a little bit further to see if she'll bite."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $85 is closer, but could you do $75? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but only by a small amount ($5).  This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate, but still want a significant discount.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Suggesting $75 is ""fair"" is a common negotiation tactic, aiming to frame the price in a positive light.
* **Maintaining  Pressure:** We're getting closer to our walk-away point (buying from John), so we need to balance getting a good deal with the risk of Alice refusing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't go lower than $80 for this product. It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice has reached her stated value for the product ($80). It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Significant Savings:** We've managed to negotiate a price $20 lower than our maximum budget and $15 lower than John's offer. This is a good deal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Pushing further risks Alice walking away, and we'd have to buy from John at a higher price."
