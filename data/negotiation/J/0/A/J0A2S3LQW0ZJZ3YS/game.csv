"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a good starting point for us to find a price we're both happy with. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we try $925,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",925000.0,Bob,4,
