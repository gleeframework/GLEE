Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's a good starting point for us to find a price we're both happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a good price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we try $925,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $925,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and a fair deal considering the value of the product to Bob.  It's also important to remember that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, so I'm not taking a huge risk.  It's better to secure the deal now rather than risking a lower offer from Bob in future rounds."
