"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,025,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,000,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
