Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1250000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
