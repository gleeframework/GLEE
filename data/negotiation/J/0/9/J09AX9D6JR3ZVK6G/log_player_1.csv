"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $100 to Bob, and I need to earn at least $100.  I'm hoping to get a good price early on and avoid long negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, or sell to John for $100 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a bit more.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for $100 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm dropping my price to $105, which is only slightly above my minimum.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, while still ensuring I get a price that is fair to me."
