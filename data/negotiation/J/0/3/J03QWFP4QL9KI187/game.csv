"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you outlining the product's features.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?  I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer and your understanding of the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I think that's a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
