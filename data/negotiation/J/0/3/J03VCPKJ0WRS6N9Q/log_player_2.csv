"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through negotiation. There are still 9 rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.

* **Message:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product while expressing your price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $875000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $800,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:**  This counteroffer is a smaller step closer to Alice's offer, showing you're serious about finding a solution.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've been willing to make concessions, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $815000. I'm at my lowest point, and I need to think about my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $825000 is off the table, but I can do $822000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $822,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $822,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations with Alice.
* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer is only $7,000 above your target price. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If you reject this offer, you have only one round left to negotiate with Alice. There is a high risk that you will either have to accept her next offer, which may be worse, or you will be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.

It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's close to your target, rather than risk getting a worse deal or having to pay a significantly higher price from John."
