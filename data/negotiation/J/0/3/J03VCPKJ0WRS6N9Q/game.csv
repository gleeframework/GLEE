"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $875000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $800000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $825000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm getting closer to my number, but I'm still not there yet. Let's split the difference: $812500.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",812500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $812500, Bob. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about $820000? This is as low as I'm willing to go.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  While $820000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $815000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be ready to close the deal right away.",815000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been willing to make concessions, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $815000. I'm at my lowest point, and I need to think about my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $825000 is off the table, but I can do $822000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",822000.0,Alice,9,
