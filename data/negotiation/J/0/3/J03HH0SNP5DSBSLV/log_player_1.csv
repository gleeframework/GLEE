"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where a negotiation feels possible.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us to make the offer sound more appealing.
* **Openness:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, giving him the opportunity to counter without feeling pressured.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also need to keep Bob engaged. Starting high allows for potential negotiation room while still showing my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially considering I have 8 more rounds. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** Show him I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Explore Higher Options:**  Potentially reach a higher price through counteroffers.
* **Avoid Settling:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to my asking price.  How about $1,600,000?  That leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Smaller Adjustment:** I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility but not conceding too much. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""room for both of us to feel good"" to emphasize a win-win outcome.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I'm still confident in the value of the product and my negotiating position.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:**  Move closer to Bob's offer while still pushing for a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Keep Negotiations Moving:**  Avoid stalemate and encourage further discussions.
* **Assess Bob's Response:**  His reaction to this counteroffer will give me valuable insights for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's important to consider:

* **Time:**  I've already gone through 3 rounds and there are 6 remaining. Trying to negotiate further could take too long and risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Risk:** Bob might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with only the option to sell to John at the same price.
* **Fairness:**  Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and this price is within a reasonable range for both of us.

**Strategy:**

Accepting the offer is the most rational and practical decision in this scenario.  It ensures a successful sale without risking a lengthy negotiation or losing a valuable opportunity."
