You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  You're not in a rush, so it's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This shows my interest in the product, but also establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  The goal is to push Alice closer to my ideal price while still leaving room for compromise."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than what I believe is a fair value.  Since I have limited rounds and a backup option, I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still remaining within my desired price range. I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, hoping to incentivize her to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I believe is a fair price.  I have a backup option, so I'll continue to negotiate for a lower price. There are still a few rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while also pushing for a price closer to my target.  Since Alice rejected my previous offer of 375,000,  I'm offering a price that's  in between my last offer and her most recent offer. This approach shows good faith and might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's still too high for my comfort. I have a few rounds left and a reliable backup option, so I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price.  I believe I can still achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly again, but remaining below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while also pushing for a price that's closer to my target.  With limited rounds left, I need to find a middle ground that Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing the price higher, and we are running out of time. With only one round left, it's highly unlikely I will be able to negotiate a better price.  To avoid risking a deal falling through, I'm choosing to buy from John for $800,000. It's not the ideal price, but it guarantees I will get the product within my budget."
