Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This price is still very attractive to you, and it gives me the profit I need.  What do you say?

Alice has come down to $1,350,000 which is a good price for Bob. While there might be some wiggle room to push for a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John."
