Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you halfway at $11000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
