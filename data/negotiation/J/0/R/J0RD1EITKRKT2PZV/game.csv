"Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I recognize the value of your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. However, due to the high demand and limited availability of this unique item, I am unable to accept your offer of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This price still represents a significant discount compared to the product's true value of $1,500,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  Would that be feasible?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your continued interest in our product. In light of your proposal, I would like to extend a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This still reflects a substantial discount from the product's true value, while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable and allows us to finalize the transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
