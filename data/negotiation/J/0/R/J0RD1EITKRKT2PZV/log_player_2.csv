# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. However, due to the high demand and limited availability of this unique item, I am unable to accept your offer of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This price still represents a significant discount compared to the product's true value of $1,500,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.
