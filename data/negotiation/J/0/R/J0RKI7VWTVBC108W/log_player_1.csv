"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to make a serious offer on the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,400,000? This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is just not workable for me.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your potential profits. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, so how about $1,050,000? This is my best and final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,050,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me.  John has offered a price that meets my minimum, so it's in my best interest to sell the product to him."
