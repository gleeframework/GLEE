"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe that would be a fair reflection of the product's worth to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the need for a profit, I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $8,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",8000.0,Bob,4,
