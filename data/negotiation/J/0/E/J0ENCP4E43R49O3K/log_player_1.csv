Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not a good enough price.  You've already rejected several offers and made concessions, and it's likely that Bob will continue to push for a lower price.  

Selling to John guarantees you a solid $800,000, which is a safer option than risking a final round with Bob that could result in a lower price or no deal at all."
