Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves a potential profit of $2,000 for you while still giving Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternatives.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost out completely."
