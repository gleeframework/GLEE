"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a better price from Alice. You have nothing to lose by rejecting the initial offer and attempting to counteroffer. There's a chance Alice may be willing to lower the price, especially since you're willing to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's considerably lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not willing to accept her initial price. I'm hoping this will prompt her to come down on her price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my target. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price. Since I'm willing to walk away and buy from John, there's no harm in rejecting this offer and trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still hoping to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation. If Alice accepts, I've saved a significant amount of money. If she rejects, we can continue to negotiate in the subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has continued to lower her price, but it's still slightly above my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I'm confident I can still get a better deal. I have 5 rounds left, and it's not yet worth risking buying from John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice that I'm getting closer to her price.  This counteroffer is only $50,000 less than her current offer, so it's likely she will accept. If she does, I've saved $50,000. If she doesn't, we have four rounds left to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I still think I can get a better deal. I have three rounds left and John's offer is still a fallback option.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1310000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, getting closer to Alice's offer.  This time I'm only offering $10,000 less than her price. This shows Alice I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm still trying to get the best possible price. If she accepts, I've saved $10,000. If she doesn't, we have two rounds left to try and reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,315,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,315,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, the risk of rejecting Alice's offer and not reaching a deal is high. Alice has lowered her price to $1,315,000, which is close to my last counteroffer and a significant saving compared to John's offer.  At this point, it's better to accept and secure the product at a good price rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
