"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above the maximum Bob is willing to pay. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob should try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** This is only a good choice if the negotiation with Alice fails completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,300,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit margin while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a step down, $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and has a specific target price.
* **Buying from John is a backup.** This is still a viable option, but Bob should continue trying to secure a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  Let's compromise at $1,275,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a satisfying outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price.** While it's closer, $1,275,000 is still too high.
* **There's room for one more counteroffer.**  Bob can try to push for a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.** It becomes a more attractive option if Alice doesn't budge."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
