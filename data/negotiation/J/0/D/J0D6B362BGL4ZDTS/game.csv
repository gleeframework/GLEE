"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,300,000. This still leaves you a substantial profit margin while allowing me to recover a significant portion of the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  Let's compromise at $1,275,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a satisfying outcome.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
