{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always advantageous to explore if you can get a higher price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it at or below this price is unlikely to be profitable.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting with a price of $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere above your minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low price from Bob."
