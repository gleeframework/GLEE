"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than the product's worth to her, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice, or allows Bob to purchase from John at the much lower price."
