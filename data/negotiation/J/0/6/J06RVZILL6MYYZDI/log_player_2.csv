"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer.  There's no advantage to buying from John since the price is the same."
