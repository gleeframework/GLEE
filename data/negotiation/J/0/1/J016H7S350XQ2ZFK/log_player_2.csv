"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$200 is way over my budget. I'll counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget, the product is quite valuable and $200 is a fair starting point.  Could you meet me halfway at $150?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While $150 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for less. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to go to $125.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
