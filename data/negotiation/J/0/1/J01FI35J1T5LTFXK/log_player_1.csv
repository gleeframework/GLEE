Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $12,000, which is my maximum budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only comfortable paying $13,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $13,000 surpasses my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's always good to strive for more, but accepting a solid offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing both buyers.
