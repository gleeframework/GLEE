"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my minimum requirement, I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $875,000 is below Bob's maximum limit of $800,000. 
* **Saving money:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's still advantageous, saving him $25,000 compared to buying from John. 

Since Bob's priority is to buy the product while saving money, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
