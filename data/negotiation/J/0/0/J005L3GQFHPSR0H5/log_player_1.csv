{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also within Bob's range of value, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and my minimum requirement, I'm willing to go down to $875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
