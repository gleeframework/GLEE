"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob. This is a reasonable starting point, as I have a higher valuation for the product and want to maximize my profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target by counteroffering.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500, which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial asking price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make my offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $11,750 is closer to my target, but I think I can do better. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my minimum.  It's a fair price for the product, and it would be a great investment for you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000, which is my minimum price and the same as John's offer. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price and a good investment for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
