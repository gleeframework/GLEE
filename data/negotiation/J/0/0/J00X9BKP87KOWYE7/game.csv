"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $10,500 is unfortunately not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to make this deal work. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I still can't go as high as $11,250.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,750? It's closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair price for us both.",10750.0,Bob,4,
