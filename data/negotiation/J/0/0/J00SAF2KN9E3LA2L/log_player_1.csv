"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $875,000 is still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle at $885,000. This is a good price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 885000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $885,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $880,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is only $5,000 less than my last counteroffer.  We're close to a deal, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significantly better price than selling to John."
