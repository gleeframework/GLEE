"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than her own value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still too high for my budget. While it's closer to my target, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring counteroffers to try and get a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer to $860,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a favorable deal."", ""product_price"": 860000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $890,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still a bit higher than I'd like.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle yet.  I'll continue to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $890,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $870,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 870000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is only $15,000 away from my last counteroffer. At this point, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Alice will come down further.  It's a decent price, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get it even lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a much higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
