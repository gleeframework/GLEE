"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. There's no information about the value of the product to Alice, so there's a chance she might be willing to accept a lower price.  It's always worth negotiating, especially when the initial offer is at the maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,000 is a bold move, but it sets a clear expectation of negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter with a higher price, but this gives Bob a starting point to work from."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  However, Bob can still aim for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further exploration of potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's serious about buying but still aiming for a good deal.  $12,000 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a good midpoint to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,500.  This is a reasonable price, considering Bob's maximum budget is $15,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product at a significant discount while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially reaching a stalemate."
