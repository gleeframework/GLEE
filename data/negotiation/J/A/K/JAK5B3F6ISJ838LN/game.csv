"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for your company. I'm offering it to you at $1,400,000. This price reflects its high quality and potential for growth. I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we settle around $1,100,000? I think that's fair given the current market.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still very fair considering the product's value and potential.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value at $1,250,000, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm confident this product can generate significant returns for your company.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,225,000.  This represents a substantial discount from my original asking price, but it's the lowest I can go while still making a reasonable profit.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this final offer.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit and offer you $1,175,000.  I'm hoping that shows my seriousness about getting this deal done.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
