"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this work. How about $8,500? It's a fair compromise, and it's still within your range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're still quite a bit away from Alice's offer and our ideal price.  Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a significant jump from my previous offer."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $8,250. It's a reasonable midpoint that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to our range, but we can still try to negotiate a slightly better price. We're getting close to our fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,900. I feel this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget."",
""product_price"": 7900
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $7,900 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,100. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within a reasonable range for you. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to our fallback option of buying from John. It's unlikely we'll be able to get the price much lower, and we risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $8,100 is a good compromise."
