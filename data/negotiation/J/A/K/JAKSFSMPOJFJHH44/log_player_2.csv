"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are only willing to pay $120, and Alice's offer of $170 is significantly more than that.
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, even if there's a risk she'll reject your offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You have the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no immediate need to accept an unfavorable offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You are only willing to pay $120, and Alice's offer of $140 is still more than that.
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile.**  Alice has lowered the price, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to get the price even lower.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can still buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no need to accept an unfavorable offer yet."
