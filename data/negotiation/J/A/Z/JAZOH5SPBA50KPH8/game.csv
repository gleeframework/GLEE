"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for something closer to $2,100,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns. Would you be open to meeting somewhere in the middle?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $2,100,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price for both parties and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
