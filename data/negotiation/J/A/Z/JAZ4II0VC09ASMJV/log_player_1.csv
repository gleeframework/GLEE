Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob that it's worth the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might lose out if he doesn't take this offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and suggests you're open to discussing the price further if Bob has concerns.

While we know Bob values the product at $12,000,  he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it immediately and avoid the hassle of competing with other potential buyers."
