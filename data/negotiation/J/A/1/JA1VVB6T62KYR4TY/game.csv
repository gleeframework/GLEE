I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1000000. I think this is a great deal considering its value to you is $800000. What do you think?,1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $800000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1200000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $950000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to stay within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $920000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $980000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $980000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $920000, which was my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm starting to consider buying the product from John for $800000 if we can't come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
