"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is tempting, it's just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
