"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and there's room for negotiation. He can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12000 is tempting, it's just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $12,500 is within his budget and a good compromise.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his counteroffer or go back to her initial price. It's better to secure the deal at this point."
