"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence in its potential. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward towards a successful transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is a bit below what I need to achieve my desired outcome, I'm open to a compromise.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers and still allows for a fair profit margin for me. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement in this round.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
