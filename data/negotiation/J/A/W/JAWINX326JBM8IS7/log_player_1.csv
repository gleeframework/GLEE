Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point as it allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my price or consider selling to John if the negotiation gets too lengthy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low, considering my minimum selling price is $12,000. I'll counter with a higher offer.  I still want to negotiate with Bob as he is a potential buyer, and I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you as the product is worth $10,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is closer to my desired price range and is a good compromise.  While it's still less than my minimum of $12,000, it's a better deal than selling to John for $12,000. This ensures a quicker sale and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
