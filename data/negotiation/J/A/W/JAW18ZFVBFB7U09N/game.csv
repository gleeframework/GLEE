"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product holds significant value to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a significant investment for me. To make this work, I can offer you $700,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while respecting my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have an alternative offer for $800,000. I'd much prefer to work with you, but I need us to meet at that price point. Would you be willing to reconsider?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
