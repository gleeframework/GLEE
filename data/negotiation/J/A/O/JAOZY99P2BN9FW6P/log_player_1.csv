{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while signaling my desired profit margin. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A positive and friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the product's ""true value"" to further justify my price and encourage Bob to consider it a good deal.

This offer gives me a good chance to maximize my profit while also leaving room for counteroffers and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to that price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I believe there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I think this price is fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer by proposing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Compromise & Fairness:** I'm framing this as a compromise and emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid creating tension. 

This counteroffer gives me a good chance of reaching an agreement closer to my desired price point while still being reasonable and showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made concessions and there's a limit to how much further I'm willing to go.  The risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price isn't worth it.  Therefore, it's best to sell the product to John at $15,000, guaranteeing my minimum desired profit and avoiding further potentially unsuccessful negotiation rounds."
