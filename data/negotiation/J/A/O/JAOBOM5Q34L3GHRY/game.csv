"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85.  This is still a great price for a product that's worth $80 to you.  Let's make a deal!",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal!",82.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $82 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $79 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",79.0,Bob,6,
