Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you and I believe this is a fair price. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still leave room for negotiation and entice Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $10,000, starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still giving Alice a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, so she can afford to start higher with Bob.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
