"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can we meet in the middle at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This still represents a great deal for you, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $700000. Can we discuss this further?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is simply too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $800000. This represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this.",800000.0,Alice,5,
