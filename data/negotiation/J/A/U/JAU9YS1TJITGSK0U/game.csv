"Hi Alice, thanks for offering your product. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $7,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",7500.0,Alice,5,
