"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $15,000 is closer to what I'm looking for,  I can't go that low quite yet. How about we settle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,500 is a bit too rich for my blood. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $14,000 is cutting it a bit too close for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and worth every penny.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,250?",15250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $15,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,6,
