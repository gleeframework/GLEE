I'm starting with my minimum price because it's in my best interest to sell to Bob if possible.  If he rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$9,000 is too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $11,000. It's still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than his previous offer, I'm still not getting my desired price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $10,500. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still a decent profit for me. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum. However, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point. I'll sell to John for $12,000, which is a better deal for me."
