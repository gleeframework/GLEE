"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in buying it, but I'm only able to offer $10000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $13000. It's a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $11000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13000. How about we try $12500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll offer $11500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $11500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $12200? It's a small step closer to my original price, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",12200.0,Alice,7,
