"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's best to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm interested in buying it, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $13000. It's a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can still get the product from John for $10,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $11000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $13000. How about we try $12500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $12,500 is lower than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll offer $11,500, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $11500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $12200? It's a small step closer to my original price, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $12,200 is still too high, and the negotiation is getting close to the end. With only three rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price that works for Bob.  It's better to secure the product from John at his price of $10,000 and avoid any further negotiation risk."
