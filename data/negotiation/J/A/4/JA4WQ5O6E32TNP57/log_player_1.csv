Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John for $150, so I don't need to accept anything lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  While I would like to sell it for $150 to John, I'm willing to negotiate with Bob a bit more before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but still keep it above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  Since I'm not sure how much longer Bob is willing to negotiate, I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $130.  This is better than my minimum price and allows me to avoid selling to John and potentially missing out on a future opportunity with Bob."
