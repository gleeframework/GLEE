Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 allows for some negotiation downward if Bob hesitates. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, selling to Bob quickly at a higher price is more desirable."
