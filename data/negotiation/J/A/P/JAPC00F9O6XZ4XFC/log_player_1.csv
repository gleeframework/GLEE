Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know this product would be valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message aims to start the negotiation on a positive note, emphasizing value and fairness. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, but it also opens the door for you to potentially secure a higher price than your fallback option with John."
