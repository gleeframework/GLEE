"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit out of my reach. I can do $100, which is a fair offer considering John is selling it for the same price.  What do you say?",100.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $105, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",105.0,Alice,7,
