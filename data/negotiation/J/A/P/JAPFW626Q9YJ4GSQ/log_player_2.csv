Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $105, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go down to $100, and you have a guaranteed option with John. You've negotiated well, but it's best to take the sure thing at this point."
