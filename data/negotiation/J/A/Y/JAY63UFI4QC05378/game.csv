"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I understand it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This gives you a chance to acquire it at a slightly higher price than you would get elsewhere, while still allowing me to earn a bit more than my minimum.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
