"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with what you're looking for, while still being a good deal for me.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my comfortable price range. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. "", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $950,000 is still short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer while still meeting my minimum requirements.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While we've come closer, it's clear that further negotiations won't get us to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiations that might drag on."
