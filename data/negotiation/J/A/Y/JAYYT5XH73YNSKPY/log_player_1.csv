Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
