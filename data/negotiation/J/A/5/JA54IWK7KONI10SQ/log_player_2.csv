# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value.** You are willing to pay $10,000, and Alice is asking for $9,500.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your desired range of $8,000 to $10,000."
