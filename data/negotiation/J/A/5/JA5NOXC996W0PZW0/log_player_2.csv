"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting strong by offering his maximum price immediately. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal. By making a bold counteroffer, Bob hopes to get Alice to come down from her initial price faster."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $100. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. Bob has already rejected $80, so he should keep rejecting offers above his budget and continue negotiating.  Since there are still many rounds left, there's a chance Alice will lower her price further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still not quite there. My budget is very tight, and I can only offer $85. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to take it."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his budget but showing a willingness to compromise.  He's increasing his offer by a small amount, showing that he's serious about buying the product.  By stating this is his ""final offer,"" he's putting pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $85. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $95. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $95 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $80.  He should reject this offer and keep negotiating for a lower price. There are still 5 rounds left to try and reach a deal closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer again, but he's still being firm about his budget.  By highlighting that this is his ""absolute limit,"" he's putting the pressure on Alice to accept and close the deal. With fewer rounds left, he needs to signal that he's ready to walk away if she doesn't come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $98. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further. Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and is getting closer to his limit.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially ending up with a higher price than John's offer is too high.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his maximum budget of $80, saving him money and time."
