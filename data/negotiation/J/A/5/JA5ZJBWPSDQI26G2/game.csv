"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'd need to see it priced closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,125,000?  That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
