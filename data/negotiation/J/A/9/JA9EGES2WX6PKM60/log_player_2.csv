"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking for $120.  This is a significant markup. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's a range where you can both find a price that works. 
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you, and it's still above my minimum price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high.** She's come down from $120 to $110, but it's still above her own valuation of $80. This suggests there's more room for negotiation.
* **You have a strong position.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and you've already shown you're willing to walk away. This gives you leverage.
* **Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating.** By rejecting, you can try to get a price closer to your target range.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 105}
