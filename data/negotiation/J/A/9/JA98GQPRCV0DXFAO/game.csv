"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I can see you're interested, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
