"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase a fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $10,500 is better than $12,000, it's still not as good as the initial $9,000 counteroffer.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can attempt to get closer to his target price without going too far over."
