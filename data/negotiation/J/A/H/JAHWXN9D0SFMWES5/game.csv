"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value this product at significantly more, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1500000? This reflects the unique value proposition of the product and still allows for a fair return for me.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe we're still a bit apart. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the unique value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not sure if I can go that high. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
