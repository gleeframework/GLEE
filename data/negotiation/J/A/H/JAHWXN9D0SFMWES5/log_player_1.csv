"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle?

I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob. Even though his offer is my minimum, I have 8 rounds left and the potential to get more."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can we meet in the middle?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,200,000, I have 6 rounds left. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,500,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's try to find some common ground.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I still have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping to push for a slightly higher price. While I'm not confident I can get to $1,500,000, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

It's time to sell to John.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but he's stuck at $1,200,000.  I only have 2 rounds left, and I'm not sure I can convince him to go higher.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's better than risking another rejection from Bob and potentially getting nothing."
