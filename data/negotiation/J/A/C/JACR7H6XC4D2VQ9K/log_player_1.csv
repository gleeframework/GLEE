Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** John offers a safety net at your desired price.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's enticing to Bob while still exceeding his perceived value.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have some leverage to negotiate a higher price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Unique Value and Potential:**  Subtly reinforces that the product is worth more than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Specific Price:** A strong starting point that's significantly above Bob's value but potentially negotiable.
* **Limited-Time Offer/Other Interested Parties:**  Applies pressure without being overtly aggressive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to negotiation, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a softer approach might be beneficial. 

**Outcome**

This offer gives you a strong starting point. Bob might:

* **Accept:** You make a significant profit.
* **Negotiate:**  You have room to maneuver down slightly while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Reject:**  You proceed with John, securing your desired price."
