Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get the best deal, and $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we try $9,800?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not willing to go above $9,800. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. Can you reconsider?

While Bob might eventually be willing to pay a bit more, it's clear he's anchored at $9,800.  Continuing the negotiation has a low chance of reaching even $10,000. Accepting John's offer is the safer and faster option."
