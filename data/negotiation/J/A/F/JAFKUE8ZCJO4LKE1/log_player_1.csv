{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John for $1,000,000. It's clear that Bob isn't willing to budge on his price, and I've already gone as low as I can.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on a sale.  $1,000,000 is still a good return, and it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and possibly ending up with nothing."
