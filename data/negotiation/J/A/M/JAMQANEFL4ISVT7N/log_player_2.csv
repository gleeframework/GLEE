"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep it on the market at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's offer. Since Bob's goal is to save money, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Bob should buy the product from John, as it's the same price but allows him to avoid the uncertainty of whether Alice's offer is the best possible."
