"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $10,000. There's potential to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18000 was a bit steep, but $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his desired $10,000. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $15500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired $10,000.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is increasing.  It's better for Bob to secure the product from John at the guaranteed price of $10,000."
