"I understand that $18000 was a bit steep, but $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $14000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
