"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a good profit. It's also a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $8,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,000.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially with only six rounds remaining. Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit, and it's better than the risk of ending up with a much lower price."
