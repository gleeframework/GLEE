"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $125, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $117.50?",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not quite there with $117.50.  How about we split the difference and go with $121.25?  It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",121.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not quite there with $121.25. How about we try $118?,118.0,Bob,6,
