"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
You can get the product from John for $100, so you should try to get a lower price from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still better off buying from John at $100 than accepting Alice's offer of $90. However, you can try to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
