"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her value for the product. This allows for further negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than the $95 offer you made in the previous round.  Since you have more rounds to negotiate, it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $95 and Alice's current offer of $105.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do $102.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $102.50, which is very close to your target price of $100. While you could continue negotiating, you've already gone through several rounds and the potential savings are minimal.  At this point, it's likely you won't be able to get a significantly better price from Alice, and accepting her offer is the most efficient way to acquire the product within your budget."
