"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it! Would you like to make a serious offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than her own valuation of $8,000, giving her a good profit margin.
* You have room to negotiate as your maximum price is $12,000. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially encouraging her to lower her price.
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you have John as a backup option at $12,000."
