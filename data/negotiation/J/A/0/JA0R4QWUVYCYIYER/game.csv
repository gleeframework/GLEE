"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  Let's start with a price of $1,750,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also reflects the product's true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too low for me.  Let's aim for a compromise that works for both of us. I'm offering the product for $1,450,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and leaves room for further discussion.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting closer.  I could meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $1,400,000 work for you?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
