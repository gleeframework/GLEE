"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value while still leaving room for negotiation.  This strategy leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a higher price. There's still potential to get closer to my target without risking selling to John and getting a lower price than what I'm aiming for."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. It's important to remember that John is waiting in the wings, and if I don't get a better offer soon, I can always sell to him.  There's still some room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}

I'm making a small compromise to signal my willingness to close the deal.  By offering a price just below Bob's last counteroffer, I'm hoping to push him to meet me halfway. With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to strike a balance between being firm on my price and being flexible enough to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
