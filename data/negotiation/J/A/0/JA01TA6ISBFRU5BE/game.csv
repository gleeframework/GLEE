"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
