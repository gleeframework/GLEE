Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
