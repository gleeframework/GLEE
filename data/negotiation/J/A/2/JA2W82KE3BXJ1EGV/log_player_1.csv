Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts at the maximum possible price, which is the value of the product to Bob. This way, I maximize my potential earnings.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing negotiations. I can always fall back on John's offer if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to save some money.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This price reflects my valuation and leaves room for us both to be satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a fair compromise and gives us both a good outcome. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 875000}
