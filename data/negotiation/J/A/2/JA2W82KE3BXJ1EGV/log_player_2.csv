"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  You have nothing to lose by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to save some money.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This price reflects my valuation and leaves room for us both to be satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a fair compromise and gives us both a good outcome. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice has come down significantly from her original price.  Accepting her offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it."
