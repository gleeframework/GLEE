"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm being friendly and engaging to build rapport. 
* **Open ended question:** I'm giving Bob the opportunity to respond and start the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price early on. However, I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I appreciate his interest, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm acknowledging his offer to show respect and continue the negotiation.
* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and using language like ""middle ground"" to encourage continued negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, it's not guaranteed, and I risk losing the deal with Bob altogether. Selling to John would also yield the same price. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision in this round, ensuring a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum value."
