"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth significantly more to you, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $725,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product to you.  I'm willing to go down to $775,000.  That's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low.  Given the product's value to you and the progress we've made, I'm willing to come down to $765,000. This offer is fair and gives us both a good outcome.",765000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a critical point in our negotiation. I'm prepared to offer $755,000. This is my final offer, as going any higher would make it difficult to justify the investment.  Let me know your decision.",755000.0,Bob,8,
