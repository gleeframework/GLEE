"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the flexibility, but I am only willing to pay up to $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $90 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about $95? It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $95. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Let's split the difference at $93.50.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",93.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I see where you're coming from. I'd like to suggest $92.5 as a compromise. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget.",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're close! How about we settle on $93? It's just a little more than your last offer, and it's still less than my initial price. I think we can both be happy with that.",93.0,Alice,7,
