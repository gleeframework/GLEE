"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired range, especially since John is willing to pay $8,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer but I'm looking to get closer to $9,000. This product is really worth it, and I believe it will be a great investment for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still not convinced that $9000 is a fair price for me. Can we try $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I believe I can get a better offer from Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great deal on this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer. While tempting, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I am confident I can get closer to my desired range or, if necessary, sell to John for $8,000.  There are still a few rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for that price yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a great deal on this valuable product. Let's close the deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. 

While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, the negotiations have stalled.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm concerned that Bob won't come up to a price I'm comfortable with, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
