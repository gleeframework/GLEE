Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a higher price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also tests Bob's eagerness and the product's perceived value to him.
* **Open Communication:**  The message keeps the tone open and encourages Bob to engage in discussion, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have some time flexibility. If I need to sell quickly, a lower offer might be more suitable.
* Bob's response to the initial offer will greatly influence my next move. I might need to be prepared to negotiate if he rejects the first offer."
