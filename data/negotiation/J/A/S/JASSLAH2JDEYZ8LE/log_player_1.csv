Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product description] and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the message as an opportunity for Bob, highlighting the product's potential value to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to signal that I'm open to negotiation.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also engaging Bob in a constructive conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a good price, I'm aiming to get closer to my initial asking price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price that's still higher than $130, giving me a chance to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $140? I think it's still a good deal for you considering [mention a specific feature or benefit of the product]."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but still aiming for a profit that's better than selling to John.

* **Friendly Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, keeping the negotiation amicable."
