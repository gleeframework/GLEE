"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $10,000 to me, and it's significantly less than your original offer.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product.  I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to me and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
