"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential for you, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting high anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel more involved in the process.
* **Alternative in mind:**  While John offers a safety net at $800,000, aiming high initially maximizes potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our starting point and Bob's perceived value. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about negotiating a better price. We have room to maneuver before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,050,000? This reflects the value it brings while recognizing your investment."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and our previous price ($1,100,000). 
* **Strong justification:** Highlighting the ""middle ground"" and emphasizing the ""value"" keeps the negotiation collaborative.
* **Maintaining pressure:** While we're moving closer to Bob's range, the offer is still significantly above our guaranteed sale price to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically and incrementally, but we still have leverage. While $950,000 is tempting, we are aiming for a higher profit margin. Rejecting keeps the pressure on and allows us to test his willingness to move closer to our desired range. We still have six rounds to negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is undeniable. Let's settle this right now.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:**  By stating this is our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're serious about closing the deal at this price point.
* **Strategic concession:**  Coming down to a round $1,000,000 is a significant concession that might be appealing to Bob while still maintaining a strong profit margin.
* **Time constraint:**  With only five rounds remaining, applying time pressure might encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While a deal isn't guaranteed, the potential profit at $1,000,000 outweighs the guaranteed $800,000 from John, at least for now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong offer:** $980,000 is a significant profit, exceeding our minimum acceptable price by a considerable margin. 
* **Diminishing returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller and smaller increases, with the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time value:** Closing the deal now allows us to deploy the capital elsewhere sooner.
* **Bird in hand:**  This offer is strong enough that it's not worth risking the loss of the deal for a potentially marginal gain in subsequent rounds."
