"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8800 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but how about we split the difference and go with $9150? This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we try $8900? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, and I value that.  Let's make one final attempt to find common ground.  $9000 is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a fair deal given the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll agree this price is a win-win for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one final attempt to find common ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I need to stay within my limits. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I think we can do better. How about we try $8700? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",8700.0,Bob,6,
