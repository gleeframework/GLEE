"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but how about we split the difference and go with $9,150? This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we try $8900? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $8,900 is still significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target. I still have time before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this product, and I value that.  Let's make one final attempt to find common ground.  $9,000 is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a fair deal given the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll agree this price is a win-win for both of us. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make one final attempt to find common ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I need to stay within my limits. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I think we can do better. How about we try $8700? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $8,700 is still too low for me, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob or losing the deal altogether."
