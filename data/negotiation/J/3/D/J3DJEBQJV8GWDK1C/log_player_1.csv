{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's below your minimum:** It leaves you some wiggle room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a good starting point for negotiation:** You can use Bob's reaction to this offer to gauge his interest and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $8,250 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John. I'll counteroffer one more time to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go any lower than $8,750. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the best I can do.  If you're serious about this product, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really close to walking away and buying from John for $8,000. Can you meet me at $8,250?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my desired price and I've already made several concessions.  I'm not willing to drop any further, so it's time to cut my losses and sell to John. He's offering my minimum price, and it's better than selling to Bob at a lower price."
