"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the inherent value of this product. While your initial offer is lower than I'm willing to accept, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Considering its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This demonstrates significant movement on my part and keeps us moving towards a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm confident this product will be valuable for me, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a price that works for both of us.  However,  $1,400,000 represents a significant investment on my part, and to be completely honest, I can't go much lower than $1,300,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value, justifying the price. Are you willing to consider coming up slightly to reach a deal?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm also committed to finding a deal. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This shows my genuine interest in the product.  Let's see if we can close the gap and come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
