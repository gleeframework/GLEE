Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** I'm aiming for a price that bridges the gap between my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000).  
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Starting at $12,000 gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer. It also incentivizes him to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing that I can always sell to John for $15,000 allows me to be firm but flexible in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I believe we can find a better price for both of us. How about $10,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.  
* **John as a Backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $15,000. This gives me the leverage to be firm in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the value Bob would still get at this price, highlighting that it's a good deal for him.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm not losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both parties involved. Thank you for considering my perspective. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has remained firm at his $10,000 offer.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price for me.
* **John's Offer is Superior:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a much higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and energy, potentially leading to a delay in selling the product. 

By selling to John, I maximize my profit and avoid further unnecessary negotiation with Bob."
