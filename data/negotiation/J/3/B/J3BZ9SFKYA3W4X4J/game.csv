"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on something closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is a substantial undervaluation.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a more accurate reflection of its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $975,000 is still cutting it close to my bottom line. To make this work, I could accept $1,025,000.  This offer represents a significant discount on my initial price and acknowledges your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon.  Would you consider $990,000? That's a strong offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly.",990000.0,Bob,6,
