Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on something closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 is a substantial undervaluation.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a more accurate reflection of its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to go above $900,000, and we're still significantly above John's offer.  Holding firm now increases the chances of securing a price closer to $1 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $975,000 is still cutting it close to my bottom line. To make this work, I could accept $1,025,000.  This offer represents a significant discount on my initial price and acknowledges your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon.  Would you consider $990,000? That's a strong offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer and is now at $990,000. This is a significant profit above John's $800,000 offer. While we might be able to push for a little more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob will walk away.  Accepting now secures a great deal."
