{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to see if Alice is willing to go lower before committing."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts?

Alice has moved slightly, but it's still above my target price. There's still room to negotiate further.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $1275000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down but it's still too high for me. I'm going to counter again, but I'm going to be more aggressive and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $1,275,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute final offer. Let's see if we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1200000. I'll make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $1225000. I believe this is the lowest price I can go, considering the product's value and my target profit. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly and is now within my desired price range.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid going through further rounds of negotiation. There's a strong chance that rejecting this offer might lead to an even higher price from Alice in the next round.  Also, buying from John at $1,500,000 is less appealing at this point."
