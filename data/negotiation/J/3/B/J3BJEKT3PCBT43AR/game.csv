"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see the value in this product, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $1150000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $1275000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1275000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go to $1200000, but that's my absolute final offer. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at $1200000. I'll make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $1225000. I believe this is the lowest price I can go, considering the product's value and my target profit. What are your thoughts?",1225000.0,Alice,7,
