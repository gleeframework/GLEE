"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm willing to go a little further to make this work.  Let's meet at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
