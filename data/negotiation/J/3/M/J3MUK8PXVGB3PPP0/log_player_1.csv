Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer.
* **Flexibility:**  This price point allows me to potentially negotiate down if Bob isn't happy with the initial offer, but it's high enough that I won't be immediately undercutting myself. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000 and much lower than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially inch closer to a price I'm comfortable with.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm making a counter offer to Bob, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down to $11,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and encourages further negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, trying to nudge him towards a higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:** I still have John as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept any offer that's significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer more, this is a good outcome given Bob's initial low offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has moved significantly from his original offer of $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and a potential desire for the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will come up any higher.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale without risking a protracted negotiation that might end with no deal.
* **John as Backup:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, but it's better to secure a deal now rather than potentially losing Bob and having to rely on John."
