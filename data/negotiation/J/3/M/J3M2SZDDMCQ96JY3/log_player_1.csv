Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  Would you be willing to pay $90 for it?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $90, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's still less than his perceived value) while maximizing your potential profit. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer (and you having to settle for $80 from John) with the potential reward of a higher sale price."
