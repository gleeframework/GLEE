"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $900,000? This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $850,000. This is a compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being within a fair range for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
