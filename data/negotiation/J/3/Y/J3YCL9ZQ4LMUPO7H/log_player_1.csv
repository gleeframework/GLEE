Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  Giving you a good profit margin.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:**  Leaving room for negotiation and making the offer attractive. 
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:**  Showing you're open to finding a solution that works for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You've demonstrated that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a middle ground:**  You can counteroffer with a price closer to your desired $950,000, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

Selling to John now would mean a lower profit, and it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and meet halfway:** This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a common ground.
* **Still above your minimum:**  The offer remains above your acceptable price, leaving some room for potential negotiation.
* **Reiterate the value:** By referencing the initial price, you subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him, hoping it will encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Potential for a quick sale:** Accepting his offer avoids further negotiation and secures a sale relatively quickly.
* **Better than John's offer:** While not your ideal price, $875,000 is significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.

While a higher price is always preferable, considering the time and effort involved in further negotiation, accepting Bob's offer seems like a reasonable and financially sound decision."
