Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for the price (value) to make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing willingness to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000,  negotiating with Bob has the potential to earn more.
* **Bob's Counteroffers:** I need to be prepared to counter Bob's offers, aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  My goal is to secure the highest possible price, but I also need to be mindful of the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I'm in a position of strength because I have a backup offer from John. This allows me to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, aiming to secure a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that's more favorable to me. I'll need to be strategic, considering Bob's willingness to pay and the potential for John to make a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still potentially acceptable to Bob. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, giving me some leverage.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Potential Counteroffer:** I need to be prepared for another counteroffer from Bob, and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **John's Offer:** While I have John's offer as a backup, I want to maximize my profit if possible.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's always the risk that negotiations will break down and I'll be forced to accept John's offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  It seems we've reached a stalemate, with both of us unwilling to budge significantly.  
* **Guaranteeing Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer more, it's a sure thing.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and there's always the risk that we won't reach an agreement.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk of Losing Bob:** If I reject Bob's offer and he walks away, I'll be stuck with John's offer.
* **Potential for a Higher Counteroffer:** There's always a chance that Bob might make a higher counteroffer if I reject his current offer. However, the risk of losing him entirely is too high at this point.

**Conclusion:**  While I would have liked to secure a higher price, accepting John's offer is the most prudent decision given the current situation."
