{""product_price"": 10500}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps increasing her offer, but it's still above Bob's target.  Since Bob has a fallback option with John, it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a better price.  There are still several rounds left, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's price, but still trying to save money.  Offering $11,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing that he's willing to compromise. This could encourage Alice to accept, especially since she's already rejected a lower offer. However, it's still below Alice's current offer, demonstrating that Bob is still aiming for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,600 is getting very close to Bob's maximum price of $12,000. While Bob would prefer to pay less,  it's a good deal compared to buying from John.  With only a few rounds left, accepting the offer is the most prudent choice to avoid the risk of ending up paying more from John."
