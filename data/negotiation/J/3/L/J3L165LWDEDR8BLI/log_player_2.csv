"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. After careful consideration, we are offering this exceptional item to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discount. We are confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by counteroffering. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is close to that. A counteroffer allows you to explore a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to maximize my savings.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a significant savings.  Let's see if we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your desire to find a mutually beneficial price for our product. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline your offer of $900,000. Our product's value to your business aligns closely with its worth to us, and we believe a fair price would be $925,000. This proposal allows for a reasonable profit margin while still offering significant savings to you. I look forward to your consideration of this counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still within your budget and represents a good deal.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer and you having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting her offer saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John."
