"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting with an offer of $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could accept and get some money, it's not worth losing out on the potential for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to stay above a certain threshold. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $1,500,000, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit.  It's better than risking a further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing, or settling for a lower price with John."
