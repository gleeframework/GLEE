# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still believe that $800,000 is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value I perceive in the product. Since you've refused my previous offer of $800,000, I would like to counter by proposing $780,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.
