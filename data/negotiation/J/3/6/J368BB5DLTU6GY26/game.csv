"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12,000. I think it's a fair deal considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,250. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
