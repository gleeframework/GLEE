``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and even below what I offered in the first round. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would ensure we both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I am comfortable going up to $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle and satisfies both of our needs.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While $10,500 is a better offer than previous rounds, it's still significantly less than what I can get from John.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $15,000."
