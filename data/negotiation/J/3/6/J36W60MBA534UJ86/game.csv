"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you as well.  I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but I believe the value of this product will far outweigh the cost in the long run. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $1,250,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,275,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $1,275,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000 is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle again, but this time closer to my target?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I respect your budget. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1,225,000?  This is a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
