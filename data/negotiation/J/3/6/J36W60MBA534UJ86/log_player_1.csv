I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  He's starting to get a bit stubborn, and I'm worried he's not going to budge much further.  However, I'm still confident I can get a better price, so I'll try one more time."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been very firm on his price, and it's clear he's not going to budge much further. I've already made several compromises, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,225,000.  Rather than risk losing out completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a decent profit."
