"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's too early to accept, and I need to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-propose and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of possibility given her potential profit. It signals my seriousness in purchasing the product while simultaneously pushing for a price closer to my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  $1,100,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. While she's come down a bit, $1,350,000 is still above my maximum.  I'll continue negotiating to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm happy to continue negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product.  This offer is fair and reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product while remaining firm on my maximum price point.  I believe this is a fair offer that might convince Alice to accept."
