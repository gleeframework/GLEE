"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11200.0,Alice,5,
