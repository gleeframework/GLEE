Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,150,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $1,250,000. This product is very valuable to me, and I believe this price still offers you a good deal considering the value you place on it.  Let's work together to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price, and while I could sell to John for the same amount, there's no need to risk losing the deal entirely. It's important to secure the sale, and this offer meets my financial needs."
