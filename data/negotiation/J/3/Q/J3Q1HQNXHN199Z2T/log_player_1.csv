{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value ($15,000) but still above your minimum ($10,000). This should encourage Bob to negotiate but also leaves room for you to make a small concession if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to close the gap a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come down to $12,500, which is just above my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to push for more, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer secures a sale and a profit that meets my requirements."
