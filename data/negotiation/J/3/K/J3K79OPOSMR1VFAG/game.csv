"Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $725,000.  This offer represents a significant savings for you compared to finding another buyer, and it gets me closer to my target price.  What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $800,000. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests.",775000.0,Alice,5,
