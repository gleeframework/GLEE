"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, Bob! I think you'll really like it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105.  While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of the price remaining above your $100 limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100, so it makes sense to take it."
