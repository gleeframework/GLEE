,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for.  Could you meet me halfway at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $75? That's a fair offer, considering it's much closer to my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",100.0,Alice,5,
