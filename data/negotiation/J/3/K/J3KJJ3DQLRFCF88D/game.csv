"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, given the value of this unique item. Let me know if you're interested. I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer, but keep in mind, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Given the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? This is a fair price, considering both our positions and the value of the product. I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
