"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, given the value of this unique item. Let me know if you're interested. I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer, but keep in mind, I have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you ($1,000,000).
* You have the option to buy from John for the same price, so there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer.
* Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Given the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point of $1,000,000. 
* You have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so there's no immediate reason to accept.
* Rejecting and counteroffering again allows for continued negotiation towards a price you're more comfortable with."
