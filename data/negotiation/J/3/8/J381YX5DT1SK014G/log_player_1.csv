Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a discounted price of $11,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, securing a deal with Bob at $11,500 is still a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly below my minimum ($12,000) creates room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not explicitly mentioning John,  I create a subtle sense of urgency. Bob might feel compelled to act quickly to avoid missing out."
