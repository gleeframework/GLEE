"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm happy to go for $11,000 - what do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to prioritize my own interests too. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is still a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this works for you!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference at $11,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll counteroffer at $11,800. This is a compromise that takes into account your desire for a good deal, but also recognizes the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",11800.0,Alice,5,
