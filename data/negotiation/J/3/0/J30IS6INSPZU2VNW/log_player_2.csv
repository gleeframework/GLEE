"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below his maximum budget, it's still $2,000 higher than his ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  I'm happy to go for $11,000 - what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to prioritize my own interests too. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11,500. This is still a great price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her previous offer, but it's still $1,500 more than Bob's target. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob is still willing to try to get a better price. There's also the option of buying from John for $10,000, so Bob has leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer but I'm still a bit too high. How about we split the difference at $11,250?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll counteroffer at $11,800. This is a compromise that takes into account your desire for a good deal, but also recognizes the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,800 is still $1,800 higher than Bob's target. While the negotiation is progressing, the time constraint is starting to become a factor.  It's now round 5, and Bob has only 5 rounds left to make a deal.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees him the best price within his budget and avoids any further risk."
