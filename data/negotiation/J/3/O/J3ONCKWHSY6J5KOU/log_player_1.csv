"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. It's important to remember that John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so I have some room to maneuver here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I still have the option of selling to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price, but also keep the negotiation going to see if I can push further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I have several rounds left and the option of selling to John, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price that's not quite satisfying. I'll counter with another offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum price, as I can sell to John for that amount.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept. If not, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next round."
