Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation but also sets a high anchor. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value and existing interest, you create a sense of scarcity and desirability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust your strategy.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer."
