"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, which is still above your minimum and a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $12,000.  Let's try to reach an agreement!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your original price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  This would allow us to both walk away feeling like we got a good deal.  What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference at $10,875? This would allow us to both get a good deal without sacrificing too much. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
