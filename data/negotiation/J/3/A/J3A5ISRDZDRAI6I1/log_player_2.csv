"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, considering its worth of $1,200,000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This represents a significant opportunity for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. Since I value the product at $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay a bit more than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my own valuation.  I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This still represents a significant profit for you and a good deal for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my valuation to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This still represents a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's still below my valuation of $1,200,000, and it's closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Accepting this offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a good deal for both of us."
