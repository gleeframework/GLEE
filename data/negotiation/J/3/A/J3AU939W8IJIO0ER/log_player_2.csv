"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a great value, considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly below $800,000.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the $800,000 deal with John."
