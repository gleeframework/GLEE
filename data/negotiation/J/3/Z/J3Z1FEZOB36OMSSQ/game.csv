"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway -  how about $1000000? This price still gives you a significant advantage and allows me to move closer to my desired value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear your concerns about the budget, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $975000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move closer to a deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer to a deal, but $925000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $950000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finally seal the deal. Let's make it happen!",950000.0,Alice,7,
