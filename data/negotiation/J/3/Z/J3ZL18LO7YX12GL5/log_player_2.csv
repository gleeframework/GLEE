Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is closer to your budget and still allows me to get a reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I believe in the value of this product and I want to make sure you get a good deal too. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than what John is selling it for.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you won't get a better deal.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product and saves you time."
