"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. My asking price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get as close to my minimum value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within a $100 limit. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
