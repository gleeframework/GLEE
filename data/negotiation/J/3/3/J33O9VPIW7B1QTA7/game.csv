"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
