"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation, making it more likely he'll accept. It also keeps me closer to my target of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $10,000.  There's no reason to keep negotiating, as I'm already at my target price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the best possible price for the product."
