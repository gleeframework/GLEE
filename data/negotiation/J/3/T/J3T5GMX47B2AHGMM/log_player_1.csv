Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and making it sound appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid and leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If Bob offers a price close to my minimum, I'll accept.
* **Counteroffer again:** If Bob's offer is too low, I'll make another counteroffer, potentially coming down a bit, but still keeping my goal of earning more than $80.
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiation drags on or Bob's offers are too low, I'll move on to John and secure the $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is close to my minimum of $80, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'll try to push for a bit more.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer, perhaps at $90 or $95, to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John to avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $92.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer while still remaining reasonable and showing flexibility. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $92.50 presents it as a compromise, suggesting that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll happily sell the product for $92.50.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider my options:
    *  Make another counteroffer, perhaps slightly lower, but only if I believe there's a chance of reaching an agreement.
    *  Sell to John if further negotiation seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still believe we could reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. Would $90 be within your considerations? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $90, which is very close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $80. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale entirely. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer, finalize the transaction, and be happy with securing a good price for my product."
