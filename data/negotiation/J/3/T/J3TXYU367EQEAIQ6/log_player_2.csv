"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, he can potentially do better. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John."
