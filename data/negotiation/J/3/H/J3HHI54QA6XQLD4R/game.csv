"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your position, but $22,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is my best offer and a great deal for you.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. I can go as low as $17,500. This is a firm offer and a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $16,500. This brings us closer to what I'm comfortable investing, while still providing a good return for you.",16500.0,Bob,6,
