"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $850000.  This price is a good value for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $875000. This is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $875000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more adjustment to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $860000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",860000.0,Alice,5,
