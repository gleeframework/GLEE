"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it's still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. The message is friendly and invites him to negotiate. This sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth, aiming to close the deal within the 10 rounds and maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to close the deal quickly, accepting Bob's offer would be selling the product at my minimum acceptable price. Since I have 10 rounds to work with, I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $90. That's still a great price for you, considering how much it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $90. How about we meet at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale that is above my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for $80."
