Round 6
Bob's offer:

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, but we have room to push back and aim for a higher price. The difference between his offer and John's offer is still significant enough to warrant another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I value your willingness to find a deal. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency by stating it's our final offer. It also positions the price as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's desire for a reasonable deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By holding firm at $1,000,000, we signal that we're not willing to drop below this threshold. This leaves Bob to decide if he wants to accept a price slightly above his last offer or risk losing the deal. 
* **John as Backup:** We still have the option to walk away and sell to John for our desired price, so we're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could continue negotiating, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll see a significant jump from $980,000.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now gives us certainty and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations.  We also have to factor in the opportunity cost of not having the capital from the sale available to us. 
* **Solid Profit:** $980,000 is a strong profit margin, even if it's not our ideal price.  It represents a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
