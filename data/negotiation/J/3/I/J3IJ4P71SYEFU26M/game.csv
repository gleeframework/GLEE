"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is still a good price for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low. How about $1,200,000? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
