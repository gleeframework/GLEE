"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a lot to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600,000. I believe that's a fair price given the product's value to me. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $700,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $625,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and the remaining time for negotiation.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $675,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.  This shows a genuine attempt to meet in the middle, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to give up on my initial target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $680,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.
