"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a lot to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and Bob can potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600,000. I believe that's a fair price given the product's value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $700,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save more money. While $650,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. With 7 rounds remaining, Bob can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $625,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and the remaining time for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 625000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go as low as $625,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $675,000 is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. With 5 rounds remaining, Bob has more leverage to push for a better deal. It's still worthwhile to try and get closer to his target of $600,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $675,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product.  This shows a genuine attempt to meet in the middle, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to give up on my initial target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $680,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $680,000, which is only $80,000 above Bob's desired price of $600,000. With only three rounds remaining, the chances of getting a lower price are diminishing. 

Also, remember that John is selling the product for $800,000.  Accepting Alice's offer at $680,000 saves Bob $120,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and Bob should take it."
