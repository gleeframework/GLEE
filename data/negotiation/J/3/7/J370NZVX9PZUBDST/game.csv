"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too much for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you can understand that this is the best I can do.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
