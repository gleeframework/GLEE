While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for my budget.  I want to try and negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I've already gone as high as I can.  It's time to go with the sure thing and buy the product from John for $800,000."
