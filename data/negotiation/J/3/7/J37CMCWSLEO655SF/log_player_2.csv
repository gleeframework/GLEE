(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to pay no more than $80, and her offer is still too high.  You have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  While $100 is closer to your goal, you still have the option to buy from John for $80. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 
You've already shown Alice your bottom line, and she's rejected it. This counteroffer is a slight increase from your initial $80 offer, demonstrating you're willing to negotiate but still hold firm to your price limit. It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high for your budget, even though she's lowered the price. At this point, it's better to buy from John for $80 and guarantee the deal.  You've already shown Alice your willingness to negotiate and she's not budging significantly."
