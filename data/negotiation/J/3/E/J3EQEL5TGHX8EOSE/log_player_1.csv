Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $1,150,000  is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation but still gets you closer to your desired price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to emphasize the value Bob would receive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall: I'll consider selling to John for $1,000,000 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with what you're expecting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for that low.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll re-evaluate the situation, considering John's offer of $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm proposing $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $1,150,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $1,050,000.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how this counteroffer is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've successfully negotiated a better price.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll have to consider John's offer of $1,000,000 more seriously, as it's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1075000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and even below my initial counteroffer.
* **Time is of the Essence:** I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  Further negotiations with Bob may not lead to a significantly better price.
* **John's Offer is a Backup:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is a solid backup option that's becoming increasingly attractive as the negotiations with Bob drag on.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price of $1,100,000 (same as my previous counteroffer) as a last attempt to reach an agreement. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,000,000."
