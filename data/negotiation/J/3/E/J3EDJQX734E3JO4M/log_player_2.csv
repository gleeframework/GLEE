"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's better to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first. $140 is too close to our maximum budget, and there's a good chance we can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $150 maximum.
* **Polite and Positive:** We maintain a friendly and appreciative tone to encourage a positive negotiation.
* **Target Price:** Our target is to get the product for around $110-$120, which is a fair price for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? This way, we both get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving us $25 off our maximum budget and $15 off Alice's initial offer. 
* **Fair Compromise:** Alice met us halfway between our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Limited Rounds:** We still have plenty of rounds left, but there's no guarantee we can get a significantly better deal.  

It's always possible to haggle further, but at this price, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of Alice walking away or us running out of rounds."
