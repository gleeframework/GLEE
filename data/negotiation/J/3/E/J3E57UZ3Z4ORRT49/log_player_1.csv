"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to my desired value of at least $1,500,000. I'm aware that Bob might reject this initial offer, but I'm prepared to counter his counteroffer and see where the negotiations lead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $500,000 is far too low. It's a significant drop from my initial offer and doesn't even come close to my minimum desired value. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid needing to sell to John for the lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $600,000 is still far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident that I can still get a better price from Bob or John, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,600,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves room for negotiation and keeps me above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer and be willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable value. While the negotiation is getting tighter, I'm not going to sell for such a low price yet. There's still room for counteroffers and I can always sell to John for a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm making a more aggressive counteroffer of $1,450,000.  This is significantly lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum value.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I want to put some pressure on Bob.  This price is my last offer before considering selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is still unacceptable. We're running out of time, and while I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway.  To avoid potentially losing out entirely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is a more secure and reasonable option given the current situation."
