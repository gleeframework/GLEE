"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to afford at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  I can come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable compromise. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe the product's value exceeds what I can reasonably pay. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. This price reflects a compromise that aligns better with my budget while still recognizing the product's value. I look forward to your response.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
