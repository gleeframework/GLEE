Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This price aligns more closely with what I am able to afford at this time. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is consistently offering.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
