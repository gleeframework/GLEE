"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
