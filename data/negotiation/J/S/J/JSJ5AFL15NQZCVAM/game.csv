"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,200,001. It's a small premium over what you mentioned you're willing to pay, but I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200001.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, $1,200,001 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum limit and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the product's value and my minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,150,000. It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
