"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,200,001. It's a small premium over what you mentioned you're willing to pay, but I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just above your maximum price.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but unfortunately, $1,200,001 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum limit and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider the product's value and my minimum requirements. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $1,150,000. It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While $1,150,000 is still slightly higher than your initial offer, it's a good compromise and allows you to save money compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal with Alice and ending up paying more to John."
