"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limit of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500 or meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below what I feel the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $9,125. That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750 or even consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is getting closer, I still believe the product is worth more than $8,750. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. It's our last chance to make a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $9,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to get as close to $8,000 as possible. Would you be willing to consider $8,500 or even lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left and Bob's offers continuing to be below my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to have closed the deal with Bob, securing the full $12,000 from John is the best option at this point."
