"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my limit of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500 or meet me at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $9,125. That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750 or even consider a lower price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. It's our last chance to make a deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $9,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to get as close to $8,000 as possible. Would you be willing to consider $8,500 or even lower?",8250.0,Bob,8,
