Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves a little room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Our Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, we still have John who will buy it for $800,000, ensuring we don't lose out."
