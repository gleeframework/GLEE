"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $750,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000, as that's the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, so I'm proposing a price of $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair offer.",775000.0,Alice,5,
