"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I have more rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I can't accept $1,200,000.  It's still below what I need to make this worthwhile.

This is still a great deal for you, and it allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to get nervous about the dwindling number of rounds, $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'll counter with a lower price, but I'm not going to accept anything less than $1,400,000 at this point."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'll counter with a lower price, but I'm not going to accept anything less than $1,350,000 at this point. I'm starting to get concerned about the dwindling number of rounds."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  There are only two rounds left, and Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price. John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a safer and more lucrative option at this point."
