Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident in the value of my product and believe it's worth this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a healthy profit.  I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $1,500,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'd rather close the deal now and secure the profit than risk further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
