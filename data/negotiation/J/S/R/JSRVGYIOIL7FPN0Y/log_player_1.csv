Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his valuation while also keeping the option open to sell to John at your desired price."
