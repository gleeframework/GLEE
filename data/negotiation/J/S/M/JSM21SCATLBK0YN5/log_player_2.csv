It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can potentially save $10 by getting the product for $110.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's start with a counteroffer of $105. This is still a fair price for Alice, as she values the product at $100, and it gives us some room for negotiation."

Alice is trying to inch the price up.  Let's counter again. We're still $5 away from our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

Let's meet Alice halfway and offer $110.  This is still a good deal for us and hopefully, she'll be willing to accept."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn and the price is getting too high.  It's time to move on to John.  We're getting closer to our limit of $120, but we've already wasted a few rounds and we don't want to risk getting stuck with a price we're not comfortable with.  Let's buy from John."
