"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Let me think for a moment... I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500.  I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about $10,250?  That's closer to where I can be comfortable.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,250 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,375. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10375.0,Alice,5,
