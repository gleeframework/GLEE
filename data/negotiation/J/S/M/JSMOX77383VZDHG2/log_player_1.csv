Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": 20,000}

This is a competitive price, considering the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping Bob will find it reasonable. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000, I'll choose option 1: Accept Bob's offer.
