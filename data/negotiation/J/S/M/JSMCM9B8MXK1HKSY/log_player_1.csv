I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering $110. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

Bob's offer of $105 is very close to my desired price and it's more profitable than selling to John.  I'll accept his offer."
