"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a fair starting point.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its worth to you.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm making a counteroffer of $800,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my range. I appreciate the compromise. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $725,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $775,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell we're both motivated to make this deal work.  How about we settle right in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not ready to accept $750,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $780,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a fair compromise.",780000.0,Alice,7,
