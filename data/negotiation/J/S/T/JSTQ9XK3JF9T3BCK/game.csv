"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but could we work something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  To be completely transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $10,000. To make this worthwhile for me, I'd need to be closer to $9,000 for yours. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've done your research and found a similar product for $10,000. However, my product has some unique features that set it apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, your product does have some appealing features.  I'm ready to make a deal, but $9,500 is just a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $9,250? That's a fair compromise and gets us both what we want.",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I think $9,250 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable going, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,375. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit, considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.",9375.0,Alice,7,
