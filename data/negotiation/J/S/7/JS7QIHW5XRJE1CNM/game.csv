"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  While I can't go down to $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to keep the deal profitable.  What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $14,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
