"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so there's room to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 22% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal. 

I'm taking into account that I have multiple rounds to negotiate, and I'm willing to potentially walk away and buy from John if Alice isn't willing to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but it's still not at the price point I'm aiming for. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still staying below Alice's current offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about negotiating a lower price.  The goal is to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can potentially get the product for closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. I'm  now just $400 away from Alice's offer, which shows I'm getting closer to meeting her price point. However, I believe there's still some room to negotiate. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Alice to accept, but I'm also prepared to potentially walk away and buy from John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my desired price range. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement. The longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is that I'll have to buy from John at a significantly higher price. It's a good deal considering my budget and the remaining rounds."
