"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to see if we can get a better price.  $8,000 is our limit, so we have some room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Let's start by offering $7,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and still leaves room for negotiation if she counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to our limit of $8,000. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a counteroffer that might be higher or continuing the negotiation and running out of rounds."
