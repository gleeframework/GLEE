Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, my budget is significantly lower than your initial price. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
