"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, my budget is significantly lower than your initial price. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum profit requirements. Let's try $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $975,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me and is my absolute maximum.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is your absolute maximum, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,075,000, which is $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
