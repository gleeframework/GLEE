"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's offer is far too high.  While the product is potentially valuable, Bob has a hard limit of $800,000.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best way to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, my budget is significantly lower than your initial price. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives you a decent profit margin.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,050,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum profit requirements. Let's try $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While she has moved closer to his desired price, it's worth seeing if she'll budge further. If she won't, Bob can always opt to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still unfortunately out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $975,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me and is my absolute maximum.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $975,000 is your absolute maximum, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,075,000, which is $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still too high for Bob. With only 3 rounds left, Bob has a better chance of getting the product for his budget from John.  It's time to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
