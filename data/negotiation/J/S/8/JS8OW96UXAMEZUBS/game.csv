"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me, but $1,100,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can pay for the product. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to look elsewhere.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $850,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer.
