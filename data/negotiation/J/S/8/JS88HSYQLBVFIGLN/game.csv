"I understand that $120 was a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer the product to you for $105. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $105 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $97.50 for the product.,97.5,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll offer the product to you for $108. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to meet in the middle once more.",108.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not getting any younger, Alice, and I'm not willing to pay $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $99 for the product.",99.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're not getting any younger, Bob, but I'm not getting any younger either! I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $110, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to pay no more than $98 for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100.",98.0,Bob,10,
