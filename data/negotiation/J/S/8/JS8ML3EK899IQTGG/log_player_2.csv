"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  It's better to counteroffer Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to go up to this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can still get the product from John for $10,000, making it more beneficial to either counteroffer Alice again or purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,500, which is closer to my budget and also a fair compromise.  Let's try to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I can see that $11,500 is a good compromise for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, which is $12,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, $12,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John at $10,000, saving him $2,250."
