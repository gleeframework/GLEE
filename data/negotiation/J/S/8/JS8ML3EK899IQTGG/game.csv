"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 was a bit steep, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to go up to this price?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,500, which is closer to my budget and also a fair compromise.  Let's try to make this deal happen.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I can see that $11,500 is a good compromise for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,500, which is $12,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
