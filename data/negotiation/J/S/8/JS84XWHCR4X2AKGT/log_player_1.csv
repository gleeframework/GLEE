"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob, which might encourage him to consider it. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation before potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a step up from his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm choosing to reject the offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 more rounds to reach a better agreement, and if it doesn't work out, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $10,000, but not going down too much. This signals willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to reinforce why $9,500 is a good deal for him. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""what do you say"" to encourage a positive response."
