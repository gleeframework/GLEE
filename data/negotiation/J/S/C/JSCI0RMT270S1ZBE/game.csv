"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but $875,000 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm determined to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your compromise, $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my final offer.  I'm sure we can both find this deal to be mutually beneficial.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is the midpoint between your previous offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $925,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  This offer is a serious attempt to meet your needs, and I hope we can reach a final agreement.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $920,000. I'm making one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can conclude the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,9,
