"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,500. I'm still not quite comfortable with that price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
