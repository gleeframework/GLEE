"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $850,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $900,000 for the product.  This price still leaves room for you to profit while also allowing me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000.  This would give us both a solid return on the deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's try $890,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. It's a win-win scenario!  What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $890,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. It's a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal if we can find common ground.",880000.0,Bob,6,
