Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000.  This would give us both a solid return on the deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $890,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. It's a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $880,000 is still a good deal and gets me closer to my minimum goal. There's a risk of further negotiation, and I don't want to lose too much time."
