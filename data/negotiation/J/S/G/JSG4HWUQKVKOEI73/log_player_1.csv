Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Psychological pricing:** Offering a price slightly below a round number like $20,000 can sometimes make it seem more appealing.

While this strategy might lead to Bob rejecting the offer, it maximizes your potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
