I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's worth. I'm prepared to walk away if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I'm hoping to secure a sale at a price closer to my own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to make a sale, I can't accept a price that undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,400,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but shows I'm willing to compromise. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial valuation, accepting his offer is the best strategic move. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer, which is only slightly better.  I'm choosing to secure the sale and avoid further risk."
