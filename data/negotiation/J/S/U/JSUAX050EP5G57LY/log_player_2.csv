"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John at his maximum budget."
