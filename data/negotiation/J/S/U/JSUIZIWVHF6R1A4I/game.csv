"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,500,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $750,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,300,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
