"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm ready to offer $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for a decent profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,,
