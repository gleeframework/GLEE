Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a bit closer to my target. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is still a good compromise, and it's worth considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,000,000.  It's a good compromise and is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and close the deal."
