"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love!  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $100? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more.  There are still a few rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is just not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $115?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $115, which would be $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $107.5 is still not enough for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher. With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful, but I'm still hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $111.25?  It's a small step up, but it would get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 111.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject this offer.  I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  There are still two rounds left, so I have a chance to counteroffer one last time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $110 just isn't quite there for me. Since we're both trying to be reasonable, how about we settle on $112.50?  That's only a small increase, and it would be a fair compromise.  We're almost at the end of our negotiations, let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. My final offer is $109. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the final round, and while Bob has offered a price that's close to my minimum, it's still not enough.  Given the risk of losing out completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures I get my minimum value, even though it's not the ideal outcome."
