"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a great deal to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and competition by mentioning another buyer. However, her offered price is still significantly higher than John's price ($1,150,000 vs. $1,200,000). 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can call her bluff and potentially negotiate a better price. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer and save $50,000."
