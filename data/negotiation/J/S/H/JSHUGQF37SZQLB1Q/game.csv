"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your endeavors. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,400,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in working with me.  However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,370,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1370000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While $1,370,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to profit.  I'm willing to go to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that considers the potential of the product, and I believe it will allow us to reach a swift and mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 for this deal to make sense for me.  Would you consider $1,365,000? This is my final offer.",1365000.0,Alice,5,
