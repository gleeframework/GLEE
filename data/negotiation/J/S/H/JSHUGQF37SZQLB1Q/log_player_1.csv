Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your interest in working with me.  However,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While $1,370,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to profit.
