"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to maximize his savings. He's starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  This counteroffer still leaves room for negotiation, but it clearly indicates Bob's intent to pay significantly less than Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price.  Even though he's running out of rounds, it's still worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price.  The counteroffer in the next round can aim for a price closer to Bob's maximum budget, while leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer is still within his budget and leaves room for further negotiation. It's important to find a balance between being aggressive and willing to negotiate to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price.  With only 5 rounds left, the time to negotiate is shrinking.  Buying from John at his fixed price ensures Bob gets the product within his budget.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and continuing negotiations risks losing out on a guaranteed deal with John."
