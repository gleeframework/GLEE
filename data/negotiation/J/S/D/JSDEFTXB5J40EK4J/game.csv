"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This would still give you a good profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900,000, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
