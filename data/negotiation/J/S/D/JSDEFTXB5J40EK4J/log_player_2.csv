"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $800,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good deal, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  You can leverage the fact that Alice values the product at $1,000,000 and you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This would still give you a good profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900,000, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, and a $950,000 offer is a good deal.  You can still save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or you missing out on a good deal outweighs the potential savings."
