"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! Would you like to buy it from me? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead her to potentially propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If she doesn't offer a better price, you can always buy from John for $120."
