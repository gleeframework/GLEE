"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset with great potential, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,040,000? It's a small step up from your last offer, but it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,040,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $1,020,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,035,000. This is my final offer, as I'm considering other options. I hope you'll take this offer into consideration.",1035000.0,Alice,7,
