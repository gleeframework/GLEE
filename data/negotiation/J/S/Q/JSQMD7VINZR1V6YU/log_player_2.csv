"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less. It's worth exploring the negotiation process further to see if you can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $110. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within your budget of $150 and closer to your desired price of $100. While further negotiation might be possible, accepting the offer at $110 is a good compromise and secures a better deal than buying from John."
