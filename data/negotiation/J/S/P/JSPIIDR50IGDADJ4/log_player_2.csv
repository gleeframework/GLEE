"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics about its worth to you, I can assure you that it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a potentially very favorable price.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested party willing to pay $1500000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to convince you the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to her, but that information isn't reliable. You have no way to verify her claim.  You're only interested in buying the product if it's worth less than $1,000,000 to you. Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
