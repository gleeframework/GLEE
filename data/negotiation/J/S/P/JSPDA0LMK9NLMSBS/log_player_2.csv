"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $100, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. Offering $75 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and is within Bob's budget. This counteroffer might be appealing to Alice since it's closer to her desired value than Bob's willingness to pay from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82 is only slightly better than John's price of $80. Since Bob has a limited number of rounds and wants to save as much as possible, it's more advantageous to buy from John immediately.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and the risk of losing a good deal outweighs the potential for a small saving."
