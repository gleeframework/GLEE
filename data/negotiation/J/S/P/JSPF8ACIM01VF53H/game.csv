"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
