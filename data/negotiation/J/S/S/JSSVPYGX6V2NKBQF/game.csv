"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident you'd still find it a great value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps settle on $125? It's a bit higher than my initial proposal, but I believe it strikes a good balance between cost and your potential profit.",125.0,Bob,4,
