"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your life. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have a better option available with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a significant amount considering its worth to me. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in mind. Considering the product's worth to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value I bring to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, it's still not a good deal for you. 

Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better price for you, it makes more sense to buy from John. There's no guarantee Alice will accept any further counteroffers, and you risk wasting time in negotiations."
