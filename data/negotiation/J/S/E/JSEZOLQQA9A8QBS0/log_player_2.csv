"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the transaction. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you're getting a good deal. However, you know you have a backup option with John for $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price or sticking with your backup plan."
