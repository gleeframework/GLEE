"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Alice is offering it at $800,000, which is your maximum price. However, you have a backup option with John who is also willing to sell for $800,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you no additional benefit, but it keeps the option of potentially negotiating a lower price with John open in the future."
