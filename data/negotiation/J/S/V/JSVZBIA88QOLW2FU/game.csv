"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If that works for you, let's seal the deal!",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we try $102? It's a small compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us.",102.0,Alice,5,
