"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair offer considering your interest. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a reduction from the product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
