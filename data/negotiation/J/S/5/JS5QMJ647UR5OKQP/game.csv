"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This reflects both our desired price points and keeps negotiations moving forward.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $875,000. It's getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $825,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
