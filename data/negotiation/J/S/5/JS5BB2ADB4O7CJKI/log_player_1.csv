"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the potential benefits for Bob increases the chance of acceptance. 

I'm aiming to get a price as close to my minimum value of $150 as possible.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While $125 is closer to my minimum value ($150), I still want to explore if I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to potentially secure a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $150, which is my ideal outcome. This knowledge gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's find a middle ground!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from $135 to $130.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" and ""quality"" of the product reinforces its value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The message explicitly calls for a compromise, encouraging Bob to consider a higher offer.

I'm aiming for a price as close to $135 as possible. I believe that the $130 counteroffer is a reasonable compromise while still leaving some space for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $123 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $123
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, John's offer of $150 is still significantly higher.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirement, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk and see if I can secure a higher price with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target or at least closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $123 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $128. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price again to show continued willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Price:**  I'm framing $128 as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Direct Question:** I'm asking for a clear answer to encourage a swift decision.

**Strategy:**

* I'm getting closer to Bob's perceived value of $120, but still keeping the price above my minimum of $150.
* I'm leaving room for one more counteroffer if needed, but if Bob still rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $122 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than John's offer of $150.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is increasing. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed price that meets my minimum requirement.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the certainty of John's offer, I believe selling to John is the best course of action. It guarantees the highest possible return and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
