"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $900,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but $950,000 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing me to move forward with the sale, and giving you a great product at a competitive price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  $975,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $987,500. This represents a substantial compromise from my side, and it's a price that would still give you a fantastic deal on this valuable product.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",987500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, we've come a long way in our negotiations, and I truly appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you almost halfway on this last offer. How about we close this deal at $990,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be an incredible asset.  Let's make this happen! ",990000.0,Alice,9,
