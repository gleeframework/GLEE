,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $100 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  This seems like a fair compromise that's beneficial to both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
