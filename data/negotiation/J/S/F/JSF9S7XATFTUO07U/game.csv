"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $15,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a great value for someone like you who I think will really appreciate its benefits.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for it, given its value to me. I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can meet you at $12,500, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
