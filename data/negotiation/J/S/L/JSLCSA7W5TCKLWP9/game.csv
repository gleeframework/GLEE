"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is my lowest price. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
