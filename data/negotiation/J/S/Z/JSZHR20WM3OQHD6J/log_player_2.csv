"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fantastic deal for you.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is still $100,000 more than what it's worth to you.  While it's a better deal than buying from John, you can still get a better price by rejecting the offer. By doing so, you put pressure on Alice to lower her price or risk losing the sale altogether."
