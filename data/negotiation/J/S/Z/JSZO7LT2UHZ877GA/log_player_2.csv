"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value this product holds for me. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $13,500. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? This would represent a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $14,000 to $13,750. This is a reasonable compromise and is closer to Bob's desired price point of $13,500.  Accepting this offer means Bob gets a good deal while still leaving some room for Alice to make a profit. Buying from John for $15,000 is not a better option at this point."
