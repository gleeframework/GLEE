``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,350,000, while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You're still saving money:** Even though Alice's offer is above your desired price of $1,200,000, it's still a better deal than buying from John. 

Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer."
