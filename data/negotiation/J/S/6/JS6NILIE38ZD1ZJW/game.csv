"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, so how about $92.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $92.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $94.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",92.0,Bob,6,
