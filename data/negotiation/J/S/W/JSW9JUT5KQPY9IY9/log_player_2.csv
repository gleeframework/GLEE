"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to jump in immediately.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice may be willing to lower the price, especially if she's eager to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its unique features.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $13500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point.  $13,500 is still a good deal for me, especially considering John's price. Accepting this offer saves me $1,500 compared to John, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject and I'd end up paying John's full price."
