"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. I understand your desire to find a price that works for you, and I want to make a deal happen. However, the product's value to me is significantly higher than your offer. To meet you closer to your price point, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  I believe this reflects the product's true worth while still acknowledging your interest. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $950,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
