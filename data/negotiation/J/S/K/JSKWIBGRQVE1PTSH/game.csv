"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,200,000. Considering our initial conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the market value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you be open to $1,000,000 even? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'm willing to sell. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
