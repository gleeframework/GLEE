I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the market value of this product is $1,200,000. Considering our initial conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
