"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to move forward with this purchase, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,320,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get closer to his target price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,320,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to close the deal right now if we can agree on a price of $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to both of our goals.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, $1,300,000 is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal.  He has the option to buy from John for a lower price, but there's still value in continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm ready to close the deal right now if we can agree on a price of $1,290,000. This is a small difference, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1290000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to come close to my original offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,290,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,295,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,295,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There are only a few rounds remaining, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower.  Since Bob has the option to buy the same product from John for a lower price, it's in his best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Alice.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and saves time and effort."
