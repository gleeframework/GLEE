Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we want to secure the highest possible price. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation gives him the feeling of getting a deal while still netting you a substantial profit.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives us a strong fallback position. This allows us to be more confident in our initial offer to Bob."
