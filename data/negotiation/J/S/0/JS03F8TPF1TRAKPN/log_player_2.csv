"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $12,000 to me due to its unique features and exclusivity. Given its worth to you is $8,000, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I kindly request you to consider purchasing it for $10,000. This price reflects the value it holds for both of us and ensures a fair transaction. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her perceived value, it's still higher than your maximum budget and the guaranteed price from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer closer to your desired price range. If she doesn't budge, you're better off securing the product from John for $8,000."
