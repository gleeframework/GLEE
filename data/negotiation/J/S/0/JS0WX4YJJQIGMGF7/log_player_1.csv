"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's definitely worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $90, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also reinforcing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I have more rounds available and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product for $95.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested in making a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $95, which is a compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can still reach a better agreement. I would like to propose $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown that he's unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price of $120. We're now in Round 6, and I only have 4 rounds left.  It's becoming clear that I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob.  I'll sell to John for $120 to ensure I get my desired price."
