{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $90 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better.  By rejecting the offer, you open the door for negotiation and potentially a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $75 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $90. This shows Alice you are serious about getting a good deal while still being within your price range.  We'll see how Alice responds!"

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and there's still room to get closer to your target price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, and you've shown your willingness to compromise.  A counteroffer of $80 demonstrates your seriousness in buying the product while staying within your budget.  Let's see if Alice is ready to close the deal!"

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82 is very close to your target price, and you've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate.  It's likely that further rounds of negotiation might result in only a small decrease in price.  It's better to accept the offer now and secure the product, saving you time and potentially a few more rounds of negotiation."
