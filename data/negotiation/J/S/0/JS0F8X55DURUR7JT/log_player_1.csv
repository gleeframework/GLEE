"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible.  Bob might reject this, but we have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's a good deal, and we're already on round 4, so I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
