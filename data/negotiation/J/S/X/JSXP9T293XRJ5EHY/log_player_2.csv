"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this work. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is still $1,000 more than your maximum budget. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John."
