Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

We're still significantly above John's offer, and I believe Bob might be willing to go a bit higher. Let's see if we can push for a better deal."

We're getting close, but I believe there's still some room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested and the gap is getting smaller. Let's see if we can inch closer to $1.25 million."

It's time to accept.  Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while we could try for another $5,000, it's not worth the risk of him walking away.  $1,235,000 is a strong profit, and it's better to secure the deal now."
