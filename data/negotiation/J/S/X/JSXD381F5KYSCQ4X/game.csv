"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy now.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident the product will deliver significant value, I can adjust my price to $1,750,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to adjust the price.  However, $1,750,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $1,500,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy right now.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
