"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I mention that the product is ""fantastic"" to subtly imply its worth without revealing my exact minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,500 is below my minimum of $8,000, so accepting it would be a loss for me. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $8,000, there's a chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have 8 rounds remaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting the door. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down from my initial $10,000 to $9,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for More:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, potentially reaching a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8250. Let's try to find a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  I'd rather not sell to John at $8,000 if I can get a slightly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $8,250 is getting closer. Let's split the difference - how about $8,125?  I'm eager to get this deal done and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Counteroffer:** I'm making a small counteroffer, showing flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Emphasis on Fair Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of a ""fair"" price to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm expressing eagerness to close the deal, subtly adding pressure on Bob to accept."
