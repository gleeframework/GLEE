Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe a price of $11,000 reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for less, starting closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) increases your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $11,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a price that's still above your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other buyers, you create a sense of urgency and make Bob feel like he's getting a special opportunity. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
