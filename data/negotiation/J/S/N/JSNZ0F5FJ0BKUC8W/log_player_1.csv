Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $155. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155.

I'm going to try to get a bit more for the product. I'll see if I can negotiate a price closer to my original offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $155 is a bit too low for me. How about $165? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This seems like a reasonable offer from Bob, close to my original offer. It's better than selling to John, so I'll accept."
