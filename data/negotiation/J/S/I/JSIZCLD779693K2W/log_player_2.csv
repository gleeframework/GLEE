"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $120 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($150). It's always better to try and get the best possible deal. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or move on to John, who is offering a price that's closer to your maximum."
