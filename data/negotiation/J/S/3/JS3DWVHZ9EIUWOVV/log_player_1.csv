"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $140 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Being friendly:**  A friendly message helps establish a rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $140 provides enough space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a terrible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  While $130 is better than my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation Space:**  I can still improve the offer with a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $120 is my absolute minimum, so selling to him is still a viable option if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Enthusiasm:** The message is positive and emphasizes closing the deal, making it more likely Bob will agree.
* **Middle Ground:**  $135 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a fair compromise."
