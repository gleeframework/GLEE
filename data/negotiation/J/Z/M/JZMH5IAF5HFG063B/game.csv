"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $14,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. Can you meet me there?",14500.0,Bob,6,
