"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a quick deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $115 gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still being above my minimum price of $120. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and positive tone helps build rapport and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is showing interest, and there's room for negotiation.  I'll see if I can push him closer to my target price.
* **Opportunity to improve the deal:** I can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is the lowest I can go. Let's split the difference and make this work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to my target:** I'm counter-offering at $110, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Emphasize a fair compromise:**  I'm framing my counter-offer as a compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially encouraging him to accept. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $108. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob is getting closer, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a slightly better deal:** There's a chance I can get Bob to come up a few dollars more with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $120, I have a few rounds left and there's a chance I can secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $108 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a firm but fair stance:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer yet, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate further by offering a compromise at $110. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  I'm reiterating the idea of a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the value in meeting me halfway.
* **Reiterating the value of the product:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly suggesting that $110 is still a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, the chances of getting Bob to agree to a price above my minimum are diminishing.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and a better outcome than Bob's current offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit."
