"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price.  This demonstrates my willingness to be flexible, but I believe this is the fairest price given the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. Is this something we can work with?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're still hesitant, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is a fair price, and it shows both of us are willing to work towards a solution.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still at $10,500. I'm not far from considering buying from another seller at a lower price, so I hope we can meet here. Is $10,500 the best you can do?",10500.0,Bob,6,
