Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price.

I'll try to meet her in the middle and offer $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're still hesitant, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This is a fair price, and it shows both of us are willing to work towards a solution.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still at $10,500. I'm not far from considering buying from another seller at a lower price, so I hope we can meet here. Is $10,500 the best you can do?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
