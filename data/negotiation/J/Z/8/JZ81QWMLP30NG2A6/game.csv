"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? I'm genuinely interested in your product and believe this price would be fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your business, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $8,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
