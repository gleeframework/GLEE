{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product, which I'm sure you'll find extremely valuable. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is more than my minimum desired price of $800,000, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer of $1,200,000 was a fair reflection of the product's value.

This price still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This price should be more in line with what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm going to try and get a little closer to my initial target.  There are still several rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum price, but I'm concerned about the possibility of further negotiation.  With only two rounds left, there's a risk that Bob might not come up any further, and I could end up selling for a price I'm not happy with.  Given John's guaranteed offer of $800,000, it's safer to take the sure thing.  The potential gains of continuing negotiations are not worth the risk of a worse outcome."
