"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer of $1,200,000 was a fair reflection of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but  $1,100,000 is my final offer. This price still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This price should be more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $975,000, which is a fair compromise considering we both want to close this deal.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,7,
