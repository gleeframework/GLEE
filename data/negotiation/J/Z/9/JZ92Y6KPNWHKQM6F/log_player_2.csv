Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above my absolute maximum. This allows for room for negotiation while demonstrating my seriousness about purchasing the product."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000. I think this price is fair, considering both our positions. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $9,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  This counteroffer demonstrates a commitment to acquiring the product while trying to close the gap in our desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $9,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a continued willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is within my budget, and I believe it's a fair price that leaves room for Alice to make a small concession. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating until we find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still just a little over my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,750.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer that's very close to my maximum budget. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I also have a limit.  I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'll be forced to buy from John."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
