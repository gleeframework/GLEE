Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Balance Confidence and Flexibility:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value while also suggesting a willingness to work with Bob."
