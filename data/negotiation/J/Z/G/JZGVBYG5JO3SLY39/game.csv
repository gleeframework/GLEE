"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,800? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get this deal done.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. Let's settle at $10,200 and call it a deal. This is my final offer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so how about we try $10,050? It's my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050.0,Bob,6,
