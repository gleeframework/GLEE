"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is just not feasible for me.  I can do $10,000, and that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. ",10000.0,Bob,4,
