"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
This offer is far above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $9,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves space to potentially meet in the middle, closer to your $8,000 limit, while still expressing strong interest.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message maintains a positive tone while clearly stating your budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $17,000 is significantly more than your $8,000 budget and your target price.
* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice's claim of another buyer might be a tactic to pressure you.
* **Alternative Option:** You still have the option to buy from John for $8,000. 

It's worth countering again, but be prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is just not feasible for me.  I can do $10,000, and that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. "",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but sets a firm limit.
* **Signaling the End:** By stating it's your final offer, you add weight to your position and signal that you're prepared to walk away.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Alice won't accept, but the potential savings make it worthwhile. You have a backup option with John."
