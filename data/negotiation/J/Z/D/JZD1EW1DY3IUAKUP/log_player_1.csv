Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Fairness emphasis:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing or if I should go with John's guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially bridging the gap and securing a more favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will analyze Bob's counteroffer and make a strategic counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a compromise and recognizes the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm making a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to his initial offer but still significantly higher than his last offer.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  $1,050,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm continuing to use a friendly and positive tone to maintain a good rapport.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000. I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While I'd prefer more, $1,000,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he won't budge further, and I'll be left with the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and might not yield a significantly better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,000,000."
