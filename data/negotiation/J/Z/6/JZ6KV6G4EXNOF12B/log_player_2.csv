"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to go lower than my minimum of $1500000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her minimum, it's still higher than your maximum value for the product. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $1050000 is simply too low. While I understand your budget constraints, I am committed to getting at least $1200000 for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1150000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has reduced her price, it's still above your maximum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price. If you can't, buying from John seems like the best option at this point."
