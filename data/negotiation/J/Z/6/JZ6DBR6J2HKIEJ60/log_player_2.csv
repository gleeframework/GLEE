"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than $10,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's still above Alice's value but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $9,200 is still lower than John's price of $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's and closer to his ideal price range."
