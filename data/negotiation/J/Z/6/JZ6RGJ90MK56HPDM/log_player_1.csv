"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above the value Bob places on the product. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message helps establish a good rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving space for negotiation:** The message explicitly asks for Bob's thoughts, indicating I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I still have rounds left and believe I can get closer to my target price. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have John as a buyer at $150 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and signals my seriousness about closing the deal. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value by mentioning ""good deal,"" which implies it's worth more than $90.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** A friendly and collaborative message keeps the negotiation positive, increasing the chances of a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup.
* **Staying strategic:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I have multiple rounds left and John's offer gives me confidence."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $105.  This is a fair price, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I use phrases like ""fair price"" and ""reach an agreement"" to highlight the win-win potential of this deal. 
* **Creating urgency:**  I subtly imply that this might be my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I would like to counter with $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer has remained at $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I've gone through several rounds, there's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer in the next round, getting me closer to my target price. 
* **Safety net:** John's offer at $150 is a significant safety net, allowing me to take a calculated risk and continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're holding firm at $100.  While I value our back-and-forth, I'm getting close to my deadline.  To make this happen, I can offer the product for $102.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly increasing the offer:** I'm increasing my offer by a small amount to show flexibility, but still staying above Bob's last offer.
* **Introducing a deadline:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning a ""deadline,"" which might encourage Bob to accept before the opportunity passes.
* **Reiterating value:**  I emphasize that the price is ""fair"" and a ""good deal"" for both parties, highlighting the potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to meet my budget. I would like to counter with $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a significant risk that Bob will continue to refuse to budge. 
* **No significant progress:** Bob's offer has remained stagnant at $100, indicating a lack of willingness to move closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which meets my minimum requirement and is a safer option at this point.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is increasingly risky and may not result in a better deal."
