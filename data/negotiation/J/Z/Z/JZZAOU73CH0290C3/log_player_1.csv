Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum, starting with a high offer allows room for negotiation while aiming for the best possible outcome. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and focusing on the ""value"" and ""return on investment""  justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves space for him to counter-offer while staying within a range that's highly profitable for you.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize your profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your guaranteed $800,000."
