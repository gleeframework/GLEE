"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be extremely valuable to you. I'm confident it could generate significant returns for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is higher than your maximum budget. While it might be tempting to secure the product now, you know you have the option to buy it from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price or sticking with your backup plan, both of which save you money."
