"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to work from.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm thinking of a price of $1,012,500. This is a fair price that balances your budget concerns with the value the product can bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
