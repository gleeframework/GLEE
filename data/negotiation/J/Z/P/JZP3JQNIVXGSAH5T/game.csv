"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I think reflects its true value.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $15,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll propose a counteroffer of $12,500. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget, I am still unable to meet $12,500. I would like to make a final counteroffer of $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $12,000, but only because I value our negotiation and would like to reach a deal with you. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
