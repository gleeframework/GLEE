"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a little extra for the product. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, I can still do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a profit. I'm putting some pressure on Bob by mentioning that I'm considering other options, hoping to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've been thinking about it and I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but I'm still below my minimum. I'm hoping that by showing some willingness to compromise, Bob will be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but I think we can still work something out. How about $98 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $98 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. If you're not interested, I will have to consider other options. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that by making it clear that this is my final offer, Bob will be more likely to accept."
