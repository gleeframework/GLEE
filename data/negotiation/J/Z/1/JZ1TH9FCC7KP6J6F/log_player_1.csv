Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $800,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're being direct and setting the stage for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below what you believe the product is worth. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  You're showing Bob that you're not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore a better deal:** You can use this opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. This counteroffer should be higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer, aiming to find that middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Middle Ground:** $900,000 is halfway between your previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This demonstrates a willingness to find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the value Bob will receive, making the offer more appealing."
