"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better price than $950,000. Alice's offer is still quite high, considering she values the product at $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to make this work.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate. Alice has already lowered her price from $950,000 to $900,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, potentially getting it closer to his desired range of $850,000."
