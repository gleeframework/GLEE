{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. I'm not willing to pay $15,000, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $12,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $12,000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rather than continue to haggle, I'll  take the safe option and buy the product from John for $10,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget."
