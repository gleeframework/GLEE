"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While your assessment of the product's value to me is accurate, I believe its potential for you warrants a higher investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and its potential for me.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. To be candid, I have another potential buyer who is prepared to offer $1,200,000.  In the spirit of our discussions, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000.  This feels like a fair offer given the product's potential.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the offer. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, and you're willing to sell it to another buyer for $1,200,000, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll propose $1,225,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it holds for me.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your last offer doesn't reflect the real value of this product, particularly given its potential in your hands. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,300,000.  This is my bottom line.  I believe it's a fair offer and a good opportunity for you to capitalize on everything this product has to offer.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to stay within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
