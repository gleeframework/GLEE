"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $115 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get the price lower than $115."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price given the product's worth.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're only willing to pay $100, so there's room to bargain."
