"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little bit of profit.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
