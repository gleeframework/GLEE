"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,750? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $9,200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Let's try $8,900.  It's a small step closer to my budget and I'm sure this will still be a good deal for both of us. ",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,900. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm willing to make one more offer: $9,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,250 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. I'm sure this deal would still be beneficial to you. Let's make this happen. ",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9100.0,Alice,9,
