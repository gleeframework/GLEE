"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price that reflects its immense value - $1,500,000. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to entice Bob and make him see the potential benefits of owning it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation by asking for his thoughts, inviting him to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, it's still above my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000).  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired outcome.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.  Selling to John right now would be settling for less than I believe I can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,200,000 would be a fair price that benefits both of us. This product has the potential to significantly impact your business, and this price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, reminding him of its potential impact on his business.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a win-win situation, where both parties benefit from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1000000 is a more reasonable price for this product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value.  I've already reached my threshold and don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John would yield the same price, so accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action in this round."
