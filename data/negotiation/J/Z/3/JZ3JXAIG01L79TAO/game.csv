"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,500,000 is certainly a substantial sum, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
