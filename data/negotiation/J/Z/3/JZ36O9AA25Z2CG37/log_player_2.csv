Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $110. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price and is unlikely to reach $100 before the rounds run out.  It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John at the guaranteed $100 price."
