Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob but implies it's worth considering at the offered price.  
* **Alternative:**  Keeping John's $80 offer in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall significantly, I can always accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own perceived value ($100). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap to bridge, but it's likely we can find a price that works for both of us. By rejecting this low offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 
* **John as Backup:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm not yet turning to John. I believe there's still a good chance of negotiating a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to the middle ground between my initial offer ($95) and Bob's lowball offer ($70).  
* **Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""meeting in the middle"" and highlighting the ""significant discount"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Profit Margin:** This price point still allows me to make a decent profit while potentially being acceptable to Bob. 
* **John in Reserve:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback if Bob continues to negotiate too aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $75 remains below my absolute minimum of $80. 
* **Negotiating Tactics:** It appears Bob might be employing a strategy of incremental increases to see how low I'll go. 
* **John as Leverage:** It's time to bring John into the equation, not to end the negotiation, but to signal my willingness to walk away if I don't get a reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, I have another buyer who's offering $80.  I'd prefer to work out a deal with you, but I'm only willing to go as low as $82. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 82
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm clearly communicating my position and the seriousness of the situation.
* **Leverage:** Introducing John's offer provides a credible alternative for Bob to consider. It demonstrates that I'm not desperate to make a sale at any cost.
* **Slight Compromise:** I've come down slightly from my $85 offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate but not at the expense of a significant loss. 
* **Clear Expectation:** Bob now understands my bottom line. This increases the likelihood of a quick resolution - either he accepts this offer or we walk away."
