"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price.  I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still significantly below its true worth. Let me know if you're interested!",1150000.0,Alice,1,
