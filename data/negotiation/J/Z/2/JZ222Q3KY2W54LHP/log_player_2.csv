{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

There's no point in accepting Alice's offer right away. You haven't gathered any information about her minimum selling price. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price without immediately resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is a strong starting point to explore the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my ideal price.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, and it's only $50,000 more than my last counteroffer.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether. While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, I'm satisfied with this price and want to secure the product."
