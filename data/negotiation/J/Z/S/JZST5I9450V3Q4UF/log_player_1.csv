"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's less than Bob's valuation:**  $120 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have space to potentially lower the price if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I consider a fair price for the product.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $105, which is just $5 away from my previous offer of $110. At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer. It's a decent profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John for $80 would be significantly less profitable."
