"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights and expertise. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1,200,000  doesn't reflect the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept anything below $1,450,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  I can sense we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
