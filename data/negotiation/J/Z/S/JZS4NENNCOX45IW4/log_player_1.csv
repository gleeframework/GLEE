{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly below my minimum desired value, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a good profit. I also provide a positive message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $10000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is still better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
