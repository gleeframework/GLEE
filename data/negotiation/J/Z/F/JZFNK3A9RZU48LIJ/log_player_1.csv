Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's more than my minimum value of $150, but still potentially attractive to Bob since the product is worth $150 to him.  I'm hoping to get as close to his maximum value as possible while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I get at least my minimum value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum value, and hopefully, it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go any lower than $150.  To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
