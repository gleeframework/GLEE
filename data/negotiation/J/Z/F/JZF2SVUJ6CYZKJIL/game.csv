"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. I believe this price still represents a great value for you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to be closer to your target, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $810,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",810000.0,Bob,6,
