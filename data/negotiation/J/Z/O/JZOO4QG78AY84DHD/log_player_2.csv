"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He's starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a price that's above Alice's minimum acceptable value. This opens room for negotiation, while also showing Bob's serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $9,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident you'll get great value from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $10,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
