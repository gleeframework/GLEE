"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1400000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However,  $1400000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1350000, which is a compromise between our two offers. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1350000 is closer, it's still outside of my budget. To make this work for both of us, I'm offering a final price of $1300000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair deal. I'm confident that this is a good compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I still need to ensure I get a good deal for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000, which is a bit higher than your last offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
