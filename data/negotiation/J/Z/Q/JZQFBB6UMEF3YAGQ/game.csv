"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
