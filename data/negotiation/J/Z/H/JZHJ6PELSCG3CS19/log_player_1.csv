I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and it might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer that's still profitable for me.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I'd love to have the sale wrapped up, I need to hold out for more. $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I have a feeling Bob might be willing to pay more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit for me and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not desperate to get the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I believe that continuing to negotiate might not yield significantly better results.  It's best to close the deal now and secure $1,100,000."
