Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and possibly accept a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $120, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer.  This also allows me to assess how much he values the product and potentially adjust my strategy.

**If Bob counteroffers:** I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next move accordingly. If his offer is close to my minimum ($80), I might accept. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer, keeping in mind the risk of losing the sale to John if the negotiation drags on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:** Bob's counteroffer of $100 is significantly closer to my minimum of $80 than my initial offer of $120. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might reject and I'd have to sell to John for $80.  
* **Time and Value:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that's above my minimum value. This is the best option given the current situation and the risk of losing the deal to John."
