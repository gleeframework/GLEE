Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. This is a great deal you won't want to miss!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above my minimum ($150). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $135 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and I can always come down a bit.
* **Create Urgency:** Highlighting a ""limited time"" offer might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing I can sell to John for $150."
