Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product between $80 and $150 allows you to potentially make a profit. Setting the price closer to Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a sale while maximizing your profit.

By starting at $130, we leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  Even if he negotiates down slightly, we're still well above our minimum selling price to John."
