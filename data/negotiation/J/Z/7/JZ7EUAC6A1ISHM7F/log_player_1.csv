Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at that price or lower would be leaving money on the table.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John will buy the product at Alice's desired price gives her bargaining power.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.

**Strategy:**

The offer aims to find a balance:

* High enough that Alice profits significantly if Bob accepts.
* Low enough that it's tempting for Bob compared to losing the opportunity entirely. 

This initial offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters."
