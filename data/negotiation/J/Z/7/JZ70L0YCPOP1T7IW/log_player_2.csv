"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $65 is still a good amount less than your limit of $120. Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

Since Alice's initial offer was $65, a counteroffer of $50 is a reasonable starting point.  It's a significant discount that shows you're serious about buying but also leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has moved slightly lower, but it's still more than your initial counteroffer. Rejecting allows you to see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
``` 

Since Alice moved from $65 to $60, a counteroffer of $55 shows that you're willing to compromise but also that you're not going to drastically increase your offer. This keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $62.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is going back and forth, but she's not coming down as much as you'd like.  Rejecting the offer keeps you in the game and allows you to make a counteroffer that moves the price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 57.5}
```

Since Alice went up to $62.5, a counteroffer of $57.5 is a reasonable compromise that demonstrates your willingness to meet her halfway. This keeps the negotiation moving and might push her closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has reverted back to her initial offer of $65, and you've already made a counteroffer at that price.  She's clearly not budging, and you have only a few rounds left. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at $120 to ensure you get the product.  While it's not ideal, it's still within your budget, and it guarantees you a deal."
