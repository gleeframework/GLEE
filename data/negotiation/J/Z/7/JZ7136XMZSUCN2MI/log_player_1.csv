Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Urgency:** Highlighting other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, strengthening your position if he counters.
* **Backup Plan:** The worst-case scenario is John buys it for $800,000, so any amount above that is a win. 

By starting high but still below Bob's perceived value, Alice increases her chances of a significant profit while still having a safety net with John."
