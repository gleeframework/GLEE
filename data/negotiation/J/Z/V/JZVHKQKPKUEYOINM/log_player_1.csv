**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, it's becoming increasingly clear that he is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,230,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
