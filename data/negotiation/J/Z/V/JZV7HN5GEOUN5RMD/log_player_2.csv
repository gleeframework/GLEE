Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $837,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $860,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000

At $860,000, we're getting close to Alice's likely bottom line, and further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer saves a significant amount compared to John's price."
