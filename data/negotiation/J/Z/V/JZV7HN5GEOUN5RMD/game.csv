"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $875,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. Would you be willing to consider $837,500?",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $837,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $860,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",860000.0,Alice,5,
