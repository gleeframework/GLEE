{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also a good starting point for me as it's below my minimum threshold of $12,000. This strategy allows for potential negotiation while also ensuring I don't lose out on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I also have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. While $8,500 is a good start, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a great deal for you and still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500, which would be $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, it's still significantly below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in coming up to $8,750.  While I value our negotiation, I can't go lower than $9,250 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Negotiating further seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price. Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price and maximize my profit."
