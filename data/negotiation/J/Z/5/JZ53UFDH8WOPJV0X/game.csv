"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I also have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. While $8,500 is a good start, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a great deal for you and still allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500, which would be $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in coming up to $8,750.  While I value our negotiation, I can't go lower than $9,250 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can find common ground. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,6,
