{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, suggesting it's a good deal for him.
* **Open-ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, encouraging a response and further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.** While I could sell to John for $80, I'd prefer to keep negotiating with Bob to see if I can reach a higher price. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Bob acknowledges the product's value and is willing to pay more than John. I believe I can convince him to go higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price by $10. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $110 is still a fair price.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation."
