"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120. 
* You're willing to pay a maximum of $150. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $120 to $110. 
* This is still a good deal for me since I'm willing to pay up to $150.
* It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John."
