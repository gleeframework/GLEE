"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I need to be a little more frugal.  Would you consider $1,100,000?  We're getting close, and I'd like to wrap this up.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
