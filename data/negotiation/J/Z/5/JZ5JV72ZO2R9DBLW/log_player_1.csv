Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $20,000 as my initial offer, leaving room for negotiation. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation. 

It's important to consider these factors as we continue the negotiation:

* **Bob's potential value:** The more we can learn about what Bob is willing to pay, the better we can adjust our offers. 
* **Our own risk tolerance:**  How much are we willing to potentially lose by negotiating with Bob instead of selling to John immediately?
* **Our ability to judge Bob's sincerity:**  Is he genuinely interested, or is he just trying to get a lower price? 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. He clearly values the product, and we haven't had much back-and-forth yet. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we split the difference at $19,000?  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm countering with $19,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.  The message is friendly and emphasizes fairness, which hopefully keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $17,500 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $18,500.  This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product, and it allows for both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm countering with $18,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing my commitment to reaching a deal.  The message emphasizes the value of the product and the fairness of the offer, while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting close to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is going nowhere. It's taking too much time and I don't think I can get him to go higher.  John is a sure thing, and I'd rather not risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
