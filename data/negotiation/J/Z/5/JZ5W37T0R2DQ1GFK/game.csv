"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product is truly significant, and $850,000 falls short of what I can accept. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delays.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to offer my final price of $950,000.  This is a significant move for me, and I believe it's a fair price for a product that's valuable to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,
