"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal,  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still get a better price, or sell to John as a backup."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $10,500? This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10250?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds left and can potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  Let's split the difference this time.  $10,375 is my final offer. This is the best I can do, and it's still a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10375}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it seems like he's not willing to budge on his price. I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also running out of time. I'm happy to close the deal with John for $12,000 and get a better return on my investment."
