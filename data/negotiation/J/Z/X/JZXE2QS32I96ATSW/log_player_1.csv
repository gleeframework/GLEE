Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its true worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **Secure Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a bolder opening offer to Bob."
