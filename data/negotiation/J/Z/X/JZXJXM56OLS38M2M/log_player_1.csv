Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is below my minimum, so I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is still above my minimum price and hopefully close enough to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too far below my minimum price, and I'm not confident that we'll be able to agree on a price.  To avoid further haggling, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
