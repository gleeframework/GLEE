# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Saving the extra $100,000 is the best move in this scenario."
