"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $18000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
