"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it right now for $13,500. Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
