"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your business, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This price still allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $975,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $925,000? That would make the decision much easier for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
