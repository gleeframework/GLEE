Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, I am confident it will be an asset to you. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, I am extending this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product for $12,000. This price reflects a thoughtful balance between the product's intrinsic value and your expected utility from it. I look forward to discussing how we can make this acquisition a mutually beneficial endeavor. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's significantly higher than your $8,000 maximum budget and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can secure a better deal with John and save $4,000."
