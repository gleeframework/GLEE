Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $13,000. Can you consider this revised offer?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I want to find a price that works for us both, I can't go as low as $13,000. How about we split the difference again and settle on $14,500?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $13,750. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750

Bob is very unlikely to go above $14,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation for a potentially small gain. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $15,000 which is a fair price."
