"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit above my minimum value. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum price, so it's a fair starting point. If Bob still isn't willing to meet this price, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $11,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's above my minimum. I'm hoping this will push him closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,750. This is a small step down from my previous offer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and while $10,250 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John to avoid the risk of further negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price."
