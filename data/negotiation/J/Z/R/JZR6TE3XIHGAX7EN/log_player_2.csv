"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a good deal compared to John's $150, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for Alice to lower the price, as the product is only worth $100 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $120**, which is significantly better than John's price of $150. 
* **There's limited room for further negotiation.** While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be stuck with John's higher price. 
* **Accepting the offer ensures a good deal.**  At $120, Bob gets a product he values at $150 for a price he's comfortable with."
