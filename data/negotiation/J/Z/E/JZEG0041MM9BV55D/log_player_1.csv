``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I want to maximize my potential profit, so I'm starting at a price that's close to my minimum acceptable offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate, recognizing that he values the product higher than me.
* **Setting a positive tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $1,075,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it would still give you a significant benefit.  Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be at least $1,025,000 for this deal to work for me.  It's a small difference, and we're both very close to making this happen.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
