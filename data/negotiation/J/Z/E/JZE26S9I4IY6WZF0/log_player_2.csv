"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $8,000.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This gives you room to negotiate.
* **John's price is your upper limit.** You can always go to John if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the door for a counteroffer and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:**  A $500 reduction is a good starting point, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focuses on compromise:**  The message emphasizes a desire to find common ground.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:**  A counteroffer shows you're serious about buying but also willing to haggle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend around $8,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your target price, but you still have room to negotiate.**  You're only $250 away from your target of $8,500. 
* **You have 7 rounds remaining.** This is still enough time to potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer remains your fallback option.**  You can always buy from him if you don't reach an agreement with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're still committed to getting a better deal, and encourage Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping to land at $8,600.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant step:** A $150 reduction from Alice's offer shows you're willing to negotiate but not be unreasonable.
* **Focuses on a fair deal:**  Emphasizing fairness makes your offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Keeps the momentum going:**  A counteroffer keeps the negotiation active."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $8,600. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,700. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved significantly closer to your target price.**  You're only $100 away from your desired $8,600.
* **You're nearing the middle ground.**  Further negotiation could be protracted and might not yield a significantly better price.
* **You have 5 rounds remaining.**  There's still time to get a better deal if you reject, but it's risky to keep pushing.

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a price that's within your budget and allows you to avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice for several more rounds."
