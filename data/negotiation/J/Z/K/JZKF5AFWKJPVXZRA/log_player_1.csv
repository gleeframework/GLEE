Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be very valuable to you, for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows room for him to counter-offer, potentially still landing a price higher than John's $8,000 offer. 
* **Strong but Fair:** The $9,500 offer presents a significant profit for Alice while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his own perceived value. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario (Bob accepts the high price) while keeping the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
