"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be interested in buying if the price was closer to $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $18,000 is still too high. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
