{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You can definitely get the product for cheaper than $120. There's no reason to accept the first offer.  You have 10 rounds and are willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering a price that's just $10 less than what John would charge. You've already rejected a few offers, and if you reject this one, you risk running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
