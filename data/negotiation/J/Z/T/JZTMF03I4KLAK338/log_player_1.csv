Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1,000,000, but I believe it holds even greater value for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a healthy profit as well. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a good starting point because it's:
    * **Higher than my minimum:**  It allows me to make a profit.
    * **Lower than Bob's value:** It gives Bob a significant discount and incentivizes him to accept. 
* **Message:**  I'm being straightforward and honest about the product's value to both of us. This builds trust and helps establish a fair negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is attractive to Bob while still exceeding my minimum, I increase the likelihood of a successful sale. This strategy balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to secure a buyer."
