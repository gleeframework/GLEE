# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's $1,000,000 budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget constraints and allows for a decent profit for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's budget, but getting closer.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal. He also has the option to buy from John if he's unable to negotiate a price within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your latest offer is getting closer, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $975000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above Bob's budget, and it's unlikely that she will come down to a price he can afford, especially with only three rounds remaining.  It's time for Bob to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
