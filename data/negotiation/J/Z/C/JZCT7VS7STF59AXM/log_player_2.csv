"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $110 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $120, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's price is getting closer to my budget, she seems firm on $120. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when I can get the product for a guaranteed $100 from John."
