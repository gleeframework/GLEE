Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000, so this offer is safe in that regard.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** By starting at $10,000, I'm showing I'm willing to be flexible but also that the product is valuable. 

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only afford to pay $9,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still higher than my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my desired price point than John's offer.  Accepting his offer is the most profitable choice at this moment."
