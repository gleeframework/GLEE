"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $9,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I can't accept it. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is still above my minimum and closer to his offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  There's a chance he might increase his offer in later rounds, but I don't want to risk losing the sale and getting stuck with the product."
