Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a good profit margin for me while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By calling it a ""one-time offer"" and highlighting exclusivity, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept quickly without trying to negotiate the price down too much. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer guarantees I won't be forced to go below my minimum acceptable price."
