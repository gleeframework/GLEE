Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is too low and doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $12,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,200. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is getting close. While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, it makes sense to accept to avoid the risk of him going lower or the negotiation failing.
