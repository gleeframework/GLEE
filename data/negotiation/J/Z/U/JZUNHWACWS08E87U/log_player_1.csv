Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

At this point, Bob is offering $9,100, which is still lower than Alice's desired price.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better offer from Bob.  It's more advantageous to sell to John for $12,000 and secure a much higher price."
