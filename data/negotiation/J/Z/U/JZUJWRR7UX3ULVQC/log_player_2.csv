"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make you a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer is below her valuation, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can get a better deal from John."
