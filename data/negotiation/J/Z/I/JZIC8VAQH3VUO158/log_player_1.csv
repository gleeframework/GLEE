Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, hoping to increase his willingness to pay.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll keep John's $15,000 offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed an interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $15,000 as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $11,000 is still a good deal.
* **Open to discussion:** The message encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and provides an opportunity for further discussion. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a price closer to my desired value.
* If Bob rejects, I will reassess the situation based on his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer.
* I will continue to keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a potential exit strategy."
