"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I believe it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a high anchor price to leave room for negotiation. This gives the impression that I value the product highly and might encourage Bob to offer more than $80. Even if he rejects the offer, I can always come down in price during subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to a better agreement. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $105 is better than John's $100, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to his valuation but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? That's a very competitive price for this product."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**  I'm lowering my price, but not too drastically. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, how about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While $115 is a decent offer, we still have some rounds to negotiate, and I believe Bob might be willing to go a bit higher.  I'll make another counteroffer to try and secure a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob.  Let's make this happen - how about $117?  That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 117}

**Reasoning:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round and presenting it as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency.  This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a price significantly above his valuation or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Would $116 be within your limits? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to meet me in the middle, and $116 is a very good price, significantly higher than both his initial offer and John's standing offer. It's unlikely I'll be able to push him much further without risking him walking away. Taking the deal now secures a good profit."
