{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product and I think you'd be very interested in it. My asking price is $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to give myself room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build some rapport by mentioning Bob's potential interest. This will help gauge his interest level and potentially lead to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $135 is still below my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $135 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  How about $140?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140, which would be $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $130 is still a good deal for me, especially considering Bob's continued interest and my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's better to secure the sale at a price I'm happy with than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $100."
