"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to hopefully entice Bob to consider the offer.
* **First round strategy:** In the first round, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $15000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $12000? I think that's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets minimum value:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to sell for. 
* **Closing the deal:**  It's better to secure a sale at my minimum price rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.
* **Time is of the essence:** It seems Bob is ready to close today, which is valuable."
