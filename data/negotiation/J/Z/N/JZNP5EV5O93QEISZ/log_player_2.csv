"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's best to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to budge, and if she's not, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $15,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $12,000? I think that's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** A significant drop from $15,000 to $12,000 shows Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone, emphasizing interest in the product, making Alice more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Immediate Closing:** Offering to close the deal today adds pressure and urgency, making Alice more likely to be flexible."
