"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can try to get a better price by rejecting and seeing if she counters. You're willing to walk away and pay John $15,000, so you have some leverage."
