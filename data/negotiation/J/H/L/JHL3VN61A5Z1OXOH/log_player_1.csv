"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and sets a high expectation for the negotiation.  I believe Bob will likely counteroffer, which will give me a chance to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum threshold. I believe this price is reasonable and will likely incentivize Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I've already established that I'm willing to sell to John for this amount, so it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this sale."
