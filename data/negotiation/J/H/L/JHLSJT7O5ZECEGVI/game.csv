"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still below what I need for the product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,5,
