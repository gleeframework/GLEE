Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have a backup buyer, John, selling to Bob at a higher price is more profitable. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
