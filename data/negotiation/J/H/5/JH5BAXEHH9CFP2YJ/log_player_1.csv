{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **High But Reasonable:** The offered price is high, reflecting the product's value, but still significantly attractive to Bob considering his own valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a backup buyer (John) at $800,000, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer. This allows for a bolder opening price."
