"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
