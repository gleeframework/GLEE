"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range.  Would that work for you?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While I understand your perspective, $500,000 significantly undervalues what's being offered. To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the value it brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than what I have in mind. Could we try something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I want to find a solution that works for both of us, but I have to be upfront â€“ $600,000 is too low for me to consider. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort you're making to reach a deal. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $700,000. If we can make something work around this number, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,6,
