"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $120, and that's as low as I can go.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? Would you be willing to do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers, so I'll counter with $105.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. It seems like we are getting closer.  I could go up to $80, but that's really my limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'll try to meet you in the middle one more time. I'll counter with $100.",100.0,Alice,7,
