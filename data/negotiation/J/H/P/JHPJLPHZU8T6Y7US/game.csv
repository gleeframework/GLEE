"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. Would you consider $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,075,000 is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
