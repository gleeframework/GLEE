"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is way above his budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his desired price point. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
