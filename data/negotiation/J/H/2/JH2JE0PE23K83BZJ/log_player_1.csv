"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it's worth a fair price of $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, knowing it's more than Bob values the product. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to engage in conversation to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $115 leaves room for potential counteroffers and allows me to come down slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to go, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob, even if it means going down a bit from my initial offer.  I don't want to give up on the potential for a better deal.
* **Minimizing losses:**  While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed outcome, there's a chance I can do better with Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value the product at more than $100, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $110?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm lowering my price from $115 to $110, showing flexibility and willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't make a loss. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to propose $105 as my counteroffer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, there's still a chance I can get closer to my target price with Bob. 
* **Limited rounds:** I have to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob against the limited rounds remaining.  I'm willing to take a chance in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm firm on $110.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing firm:**  I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $110. This shows I'm serious about my price and limits the risk of continuously lowering my offer.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value as justification for the price. 
* **Focusing on a win-win:** I'm highlighting that $110 is a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk by staying firm, hoping Bob will eventually agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $107.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited time:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, time is becoming a factor. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $120. However, I believe there's a good chance that I can get a better price with Bob if I keep negotiating.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Given your willingness to come up, I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $112.50.  This is a good middle ground for us both."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise by lowering my price. 
* **Meeting halfway:**  While not exactly meeting Bob halfway, this offer represents a significant compromise on my part. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me a bit of room to maneuver in future rounds.
* **Emphasizing a fair deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good middle ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage a positive response. 
* **Limited time:** With only 3 rounds remaining, it's important to show progress while maintaining a reasonable price."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 2 rounds remaining, there's a high chance that I won't be able to get a better price.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid further risk."
