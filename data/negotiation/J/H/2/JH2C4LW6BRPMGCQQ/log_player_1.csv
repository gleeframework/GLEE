"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product in excellent condition, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll see if I can get him closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $13,000? It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,200. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's condition and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $12,200 is above my minimum price of $12,000, and it's a good deal considering John is offering $12,000.  It's better to close the deal now and avoid risking further negotiation."
