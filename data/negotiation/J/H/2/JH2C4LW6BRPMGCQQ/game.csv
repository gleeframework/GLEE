"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product in excellent condition, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about $13,000? It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,200. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's condition and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12200.0,Bob,4,
