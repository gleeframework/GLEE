"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product's value lies in its unique features, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the value, my initial price reflects the significant potential this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This offer still allows you to capitalize on the product's benefits while ensuring a fair return on my end.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
