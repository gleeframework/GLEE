"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $800,000 undervalues its true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit shy of it. I'm willing to pay $825,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can we meet at that price?",825000.0,Bob,6,
