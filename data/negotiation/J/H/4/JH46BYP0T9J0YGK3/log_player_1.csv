Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the product's true market value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
