"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the product's true market value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value and the potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
