"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This achieves a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:** It lets us see how much Alice is willing to budge from her initial price. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Keeps the deal appealing for us:** Our goal is to buy below $100, so starting low keeps us on track."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our desired price range, $97.50 is still above our $100 limit. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We're moving closer to the midpoint between our initial offer ($85) and Alice's counteroffer ($97.50). 
* **Staying below our limit:** $90 keeps us comfortably under our $100 budget.
* **Direct and clear:** We're proposing a specific number and framing it as a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit closer to what you're looking for, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, though. How about we meet at $95? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:** $95 is within our budget and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time constraint:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds. While we might be able to get it slightly lower, the time spent might not be worth the potential savings.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to push might make Alice less willing to negotiate, and we could miss out on the product altogether."
