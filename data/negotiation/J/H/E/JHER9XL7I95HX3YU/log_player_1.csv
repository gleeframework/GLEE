"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100. This is because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'm also aware that I have 10 rounds and John as a backup, so I have some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value, and I know I can get a better price from John. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $95. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum value of $100. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm not willing to settle for less than what the product is worth to me, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm again lowering my price, but only slightly to $90. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating a deal. I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value and I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can convince Bob to meet me in the middle.  We only have 4 rounds left, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm lowering my price to $92. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum value. With only 3 rounds left, I need to be more flexible to close the deal.  This offer is a compromise that shows Bob I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $90, which is very close to my previous counteroffer. I have only 2 rounds left and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. Accepting this offer will secure a sale and guarantee me a profit."
