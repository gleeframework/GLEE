Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can see what counteroffer he makes and decide whether to accept it or try to get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum of $80.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
