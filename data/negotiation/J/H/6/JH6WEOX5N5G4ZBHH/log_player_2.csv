"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. $10,500 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a little to $10,750, but that's my final offer. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better opportunity like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:**  Alice's offer of $10,750 is still higher than Bob's maximum of $10,000, but it's close.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, it's not guaranteed. Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out and increase the risk of Alice getting frustrated and sticking with her offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he runs the risk of Alice deciding to sell to someone else or deciding to stick with her current offer.  

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most rational decision for Bob. It's a reasonable price, and it minimizes the risk of missing out on the product altogether."
