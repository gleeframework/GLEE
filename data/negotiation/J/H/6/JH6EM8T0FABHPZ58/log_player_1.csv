Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $10,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to make a deal.
