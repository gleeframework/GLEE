"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $15,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $10,000?  I think this is a fair price considering the value to me and your willingness to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and my initial offer of $12,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
