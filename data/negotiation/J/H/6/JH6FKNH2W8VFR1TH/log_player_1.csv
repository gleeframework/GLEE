"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth and offers you a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Even though Bob is matching John's offer, we are still in an advantageous position.  Bob clearly values the product and we have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $800,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm getting closer. How about we settle at $875,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal."", 
""product_price"": 875000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  To be honest, $875,000 is a little bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to finalize the deal at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we are running out of rounds. Accepting $825,000 is a solid profit above our minimum and a good compromise."
