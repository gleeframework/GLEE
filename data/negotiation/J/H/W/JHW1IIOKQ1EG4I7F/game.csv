"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,000,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer for a product of this value.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $975,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
