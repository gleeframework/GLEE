"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a profitable deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 still falls short of my expectations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,450,000.  This price allows us both to achieve a profitable deal. It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product. Let's finalize this transaction.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
