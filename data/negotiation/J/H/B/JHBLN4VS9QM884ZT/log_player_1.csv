Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Its value to you is undeniable, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,900,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Alternative:** By not mentioning your alternative buyer, you maintain a stronger negotiating position.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. A more nuanced negotiation might involve multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers."
