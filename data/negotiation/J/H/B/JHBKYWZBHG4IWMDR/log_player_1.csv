I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for the guaranteed price. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still having a secure fallback option."
