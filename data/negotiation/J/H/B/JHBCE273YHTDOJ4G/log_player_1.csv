"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's better to try to get a higher price than $85. Since Bob is clearly interested, I can try to counter-offer and see if we can come to a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $90? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $87.5 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $95. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. $87.50 is still a little low for me.  How about $89? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 89} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $88, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $88 is slightly less than my ideal price, it's a good compromise and  a reasonable deal considering that John will pay $80. It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale and settling for less."
