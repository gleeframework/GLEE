"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $18,000 is closer to its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting close.  I can come down a bit further to $13,000, but that's my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still aiming to stay under $12,000.  Would you consider $11,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
