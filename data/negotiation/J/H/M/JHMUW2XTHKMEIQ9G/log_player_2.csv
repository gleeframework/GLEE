"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value.** She's willing to sell for $1,200,000, but offering it for $1,300,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a better option.** You can buy from John for $1,500,000, so you have a clear benchmark. 
* **Rejecting allows for counteroffers.** By rejecting, you can try to push the price down further.

By rejecting the initial offer, you open the negotiation process and attempt to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and Alice is now offering the product for $1,275,000.
* **It's a good deal.**  While you initially aimed for $1,250,000, $1,275,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless.** There's a good chance Alice won't budge much further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.

It's a good balance of saving money and ensuring you get the product without unnecessarily prolonging the negotiation."
