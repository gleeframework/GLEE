Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also important to remember that I have a fallback option with John for $800,000, so I'm not desperate to accept any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$500,000 is far too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than what I consider the product to be worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can get him to budge further.  Selling to John for $800,000 is always a safe option, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is close to my minimum price, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and agree to this price. If he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough to make me comfortable. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems we are at an impasse. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than accepting a price that doesn't reflect the product's true worth."
