Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation without immediately alienating him. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly but assertive, highlighting the value of the product and framing the offer as a good opportunity for Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, knowing that Bob has room to bargain. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price isn't my absolute bottom line, so I'm ready to negotiate further. 
* **John as backup:**  The knowledge of John's offer provides a safety net and gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too far off the mark to accept at this stage.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, leveraging the knowledge that John is willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial offer of $1,000,000 to $900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that my price is still fair.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* **Balance between firmness and flexibility:**  I'm holding firm to my minimum acceptable price while still showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Leveraging John's offer:** I'm aware that John is waiting in the wings, and this gives me a strong bargaining position. 
* **Keeping the negotiation alive:** By offering a counter, I'm hoping to keep the conversation going and potentially reach a deal that's favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob, or I can always sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'll continue the negotiation to see if I can push Bob higher.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  My knowledge of John's offer gives me confidence to hold out for a better price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $900,000, attempting to find a middle ground."
