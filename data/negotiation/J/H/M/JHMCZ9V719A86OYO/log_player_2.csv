Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $13,000. While she mentions selling to John for $15,000, we know John is willing to sell to us for $10,000. It's in our best interest to secure the product at the guaranteed lower price from John rather than risk Alice not budging further."
