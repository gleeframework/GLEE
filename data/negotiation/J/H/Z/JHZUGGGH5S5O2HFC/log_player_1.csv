Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential we both see in this deal. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

This shows my commitment to making this deal happen, but it's important to me that we find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
