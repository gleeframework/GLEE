"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential we both see in this deal. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This shows my commitment to making this deal happen, but it's important to me that we find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I believe it's worth more than what you're offering, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if we can make it work at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
