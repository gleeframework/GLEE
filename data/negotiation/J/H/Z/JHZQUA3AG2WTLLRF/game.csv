"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While the product is good, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
