"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $100. How about we settle on $102? It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",102.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $102. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108, which is a fair price considering its value to you.",108.0,Alice,5,
