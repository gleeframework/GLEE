"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $11,000 is below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could we do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
