"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it at $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high price allows room for negotiation. While this initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, it establishes a strong starting point. My hope is that Bob, even if he counters, will propose a price significantly above his $10,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $14,000 is a significant jump from his initial valuation of $10,000. This indicates he's willing to pay a premium for the product. While accepting would yield a profit, there's room for further negotiation to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $19,000 represents the product's high value, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  I think this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price, but strategically staying above my $12,000 floor. This signals flexibility while aiming to guide Bob closer to my desired selling range. By expressing that this price is a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price for me, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if I continue to negotiate.  It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk losing the sale entirely."
