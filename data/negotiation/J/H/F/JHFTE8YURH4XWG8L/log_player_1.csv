Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone is positive and invites Bob's input (""What do you think?""), suggesting a willingness to negotiate if he finds the initial price too high.

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation while ensuring that even if Bob negotiates down, you are still likely to get a price significantly higher than your guaranteed sale to John."
