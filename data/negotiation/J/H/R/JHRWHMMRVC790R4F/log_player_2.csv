"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price point.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm not going to pay more than that. I'll counter with a lower price, hoping to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at that price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you a price of $10,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While I could continue negotiating, I'm running out of rounds. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000, as further negotiations with Alice might lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
