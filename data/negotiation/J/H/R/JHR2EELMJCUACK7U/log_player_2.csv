"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is above your maximum budget. You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the negotiation open and might be able to get a better price from her later, or you can stick with buying from John."
