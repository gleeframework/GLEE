Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Confidence:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Observing Bob's reaction to this offer can guide further negotiation."
