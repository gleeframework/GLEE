Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce its worth without explicitly stating it's only worth $12,000 to you. 
* **Alternative:** Highlighting that you have other options (selling to John) can sometimes incentivize a buyer to act quickly. However, in this case, since Bob knows the product's value to him, directly mentioning John might not be the strongest tactic.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of you while still maximizing your profit."
