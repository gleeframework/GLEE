"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding that there's some negotiation involved.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider, though.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I want to make this work as much as you do. How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant compromise from my original price, reflecting my desire to get this deal done.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now. I appreciate the concessions you've made.  How about $12,500? I think that's a very fair offer, splitting the difference between our last two figures.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I like that. Let's be real, though, $12,500 is cutting it very close.  I can do $13,500, but that's my absolute best.  This is a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll see its value, but I also need to be fair to myself.  What do you say, are we closing this deal?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  That's my final offer.  It's a win-win, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,8,
