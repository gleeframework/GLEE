"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe it's a bit steep at $13,000, and I'd like to negotiate a better price. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This price still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a fair deal.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,200. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",11200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $11,200 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go down a little further to $11,500.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
