Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum of $80. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to negotiation, which can make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value of the product as possible, maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then gauge his interest and potentially lower the price. However, if he makes a counteroffer that is below my minimum of $80, I can always choose to sell to John for $80 instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at this point.
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's a possibility that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  
* **Gaining information:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gather more information about his willingness to pay. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than $80, while still keeping in mind my minimum threshold.  This will help me gauge his true interest in the product and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a fair offer, I'm looking to get a bit closer to $90 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my desired price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and encourages him to continue the discussion.
* **Value Justification:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by stating I'm looking to get ""closer to $90.""
* **Specific Price:**  I'm providing a specific counteroffer ($85) to make the negotiation concrete and encourage a clear response.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly higher price, I aim to:

*  **Test Bob's Interest:**  If he's truly interested, he might be willing to move closer to my preferred price.
* **Maximize Profit:**  While $85 is less than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum and a more favorable outcome than selling to John.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I might encourage Bob to finalize a deal before he loses the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $85. How about we meet at $82? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my original target of $80 as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $82 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $85, there's a chance that Bob won't budge further. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:**  If I reject this offer and attempt to counteroffer again, I risk Bob getting frustrated and walking away.
* **Time value:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, especially if Bob is unwilling to compromise further.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale at a price that is slightly higher than my minimum and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely. The time saved by accepting the offer allows me to move on to other opportunities and potentially earn more in the long run."
