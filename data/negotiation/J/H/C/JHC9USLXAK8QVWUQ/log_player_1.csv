Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $13,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. This price is also significantly above his perceived value, which might lead him to counter with a price closer to your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high demand (""interest I've had"") to justify the price and create a sense of urgency. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Depending on how Bob responds, you might adjust your approach if further interaction is allowed."
