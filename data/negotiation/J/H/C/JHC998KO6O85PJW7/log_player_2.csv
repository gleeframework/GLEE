**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You can still make a profit:**  Even at $1,100,000, you are still buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. This means you can potentially resell the product and make a profit. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
