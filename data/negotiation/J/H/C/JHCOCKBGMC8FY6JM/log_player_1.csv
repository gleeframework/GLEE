Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation since Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This strategy aims to maximize my profits while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, it is still significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point. This counteroffer still gives me a significant profit while acknowledging Bob's rejection of my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's getting closer to my desired price point.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit that is significantly higher than selling to John. The risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob is that he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer."
