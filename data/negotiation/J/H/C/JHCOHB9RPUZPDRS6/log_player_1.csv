Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic tone encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob may make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Strategic Margin:** This price gives me a comfortable margin above my minimum ($150) while allowing for potential compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter.
* **Counter-Offer:** If Bob counteroffers, I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle, keeping in mind my minimum price. 
* **John as a Backstop:**  Having John as a backup buyer ensures that I have a guaranteed sale if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows his interest in the product. This gives me the opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $150 remains a viable option, providing me with a guaranteed profit. However, I'll try to secure a better price from Bob first. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** I'll consider Bob's financial limitations and try to understand his maximum price point while ensuring my own minimum is met. 
* **Managing the Risk:**  I'll stay aware of the potential for the negotiations to break down and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This would still leave a good margin for you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $100 is a significant move from my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Deal:** $100 still provides Bob with a good deal, considering his perceived value of $80, while ensuring I meet my minimum price.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll be ready to make a final offer or consider selling to John.
* **Final Offer:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll consider a final counteroffer at $110, aiming for a compromise. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Selling to John remains a viable option if negotiation with Bob fails."
