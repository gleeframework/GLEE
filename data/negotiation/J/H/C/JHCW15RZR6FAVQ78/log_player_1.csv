Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is more than the $8,000 Bob thinks the product is worth, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's significantly less than your minimum $12,000, giving you room to potentially go higher if necessary.

This strategy allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, great! You've made a good profit.
* **Start the negotiation:** If he rejects, it gives you a basis to start negotiating. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  You can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to your minimum of $12,000, but it's still lower than you'd like.  Since you have the option to sell to John for $12,000, there's no immediate need to accept Bob's offer. 

**By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:**

* **See if you can get closer to your goal:**  You can make a counteroffer and potentially push Bob up to a higher price.
* **Maintain your leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer strengthens your negotiating position.

**The next step:**  You should make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired $12,000, while still being somewhat competitive with his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000 yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway though. How about $9,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous $10,000 offer and Bob's $9,000 offer.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages further negotiation.
* **Still above your minimum:** $9,500 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you are still in a good position to make a profit.
* **Keeps the negotiation going:** This counteroffer shows your willingness to negotiate, but also that you are not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is still below my desired price, it's getting very close to my minimum of $12,000.  At this point, it's important to consider the following:

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price or a stalemate.  He's clearly not willing to go higher than $9,200.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and energy, and I could be selling to John for $12,000 instead.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price, I might be able to build a good relationship with Bob, leading to future business opportunities.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $9,200 is the most reasonable decision. It allows me to make a profit while avoiding the risk of a longer negotiation or losing out on the sale altogether."
