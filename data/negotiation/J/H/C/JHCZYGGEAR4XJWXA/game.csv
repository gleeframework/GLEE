"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $11,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm trying to do the same. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I can do $7,500.  That's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value I'd gain from the product.",7500.0,Bob,6,
