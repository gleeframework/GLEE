"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $13,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price. While I want to make a deal, holding out for a better offer is wiser than accepting such a low price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $11,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm trying to do the same. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $9,500 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I can do $7,500.  That's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value I'd gain from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
