Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is 50% higher than my minimum acceptable value. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation and room to compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my price downwards based on his counteroffer, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I am willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I believe this is a reasonable offer that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal for me than selling to Bob at this point."
