"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've had other interested buyers and I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $13,500 is still a stretch. How about we settle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting a little concerned that we're getting too close to the price I'd be willing to accept from John, but I still think this product is worth more to you than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
