Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have room to aim high initially.  A price of $1,200,000 represents a significant potential profit.
* **Emphasis on value:** The message focuses on the product's inherent value and doesn't reveal your minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Market conditions:** If the market for similar products is very competitive, a slightly lower starting point might be strategic.

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
