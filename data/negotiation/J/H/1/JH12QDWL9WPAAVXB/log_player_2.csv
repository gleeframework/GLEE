"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1500000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the ball rolling. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You're willing to spend up to $1,500,000, so you should aim to get a lower price. By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
