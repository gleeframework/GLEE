"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to you, and you can get it for $10,000 from Alice. This is a good deal. However, you want to save as much money as possible, so you will reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the price you're willing to work with. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about we settle on $7,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you. Buying from John would cost you $15,000, so accepting Alice's offer will save you $6,000. It's a good compromise and gets you the product at a lower price."
