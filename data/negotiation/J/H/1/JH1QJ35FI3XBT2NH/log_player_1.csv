Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $20,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. However, I'm aware that this is a risky strategy, as Bob might immediately reject the offer.  If he does, I'll need to gauge his interest level and adjust my next offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer as it's better than nothing, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is still a bit higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise.  It's a good midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, giving him room to negotiate if he's still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John is offering.  There's no incentive to continue negotiating, so I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
