"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $95. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
