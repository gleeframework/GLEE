Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1200000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen!

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further reduction in price, but it's still significantly higher than my absolute maximum. I'm aiming to push Alice closer to my price point while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1550000.  This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this exceptional product for years to come. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my preferred price point. There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  I'm also mindful that I can always buy from John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,550,000 is a great price,  it's still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for this product.  This offer is my final offer, and it aligns with my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for my absolute maximum budget, but I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer. If Alice rejects it, I can simply buy from John for the same price. This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing the sale altogether."
