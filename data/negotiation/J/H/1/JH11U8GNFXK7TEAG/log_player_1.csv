Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit,  $1,100,000 is still significantly more attractive to Bob than losing the deal and letting you sell it to John for $1,200,000. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" we're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and encouraging him to consider the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is conversational and ends with an open question, signaling that you're willing to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate."
