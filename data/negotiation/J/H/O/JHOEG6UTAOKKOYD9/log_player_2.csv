"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $130, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you'd like to pay.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you a chance to reach a price you're more comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $132? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $132 is very close to your desired price point.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only be more time consuming.  It's best to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still beneficial to you."
