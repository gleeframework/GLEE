{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit ($20) while still being potentially attractive to Bob as he would be getting the product for $20 less than what he values it at.  It's a good starting point to see if we can strike a deal."
