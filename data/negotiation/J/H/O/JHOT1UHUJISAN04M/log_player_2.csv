It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $60 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it even lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to start by offering $45.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price given my maximum budget."

$55 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away or going back up to her original price. I'm happy to secure the product for this price."
