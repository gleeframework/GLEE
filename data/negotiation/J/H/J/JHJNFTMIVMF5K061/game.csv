"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This amount reflects my assessment of the product's worth and my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. I believe this compromise allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This amount is closer to your original asking price but still within my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both parties.",825000.0,Bob,4,
