"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I appreciate you finding value in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $17,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",16500.0,Bob,4,
