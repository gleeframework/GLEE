"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $102.50. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this now, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
