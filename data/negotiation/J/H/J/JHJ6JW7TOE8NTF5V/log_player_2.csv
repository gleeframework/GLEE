"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a worthwhile transaction. I propose a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you create the opportunity for a counter-offer or to proceed with your backup plan, saving a considerable amount of money."
