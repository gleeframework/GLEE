Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** $1,150,000 is still above Bob's value of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  It's below your minimum value of $1,200,000, giving you some wiggle room to potentially accept a lower offer if necessary.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still setting a high starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

It's also worth noting that selling to John for $1,200,000 is always a secure option. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating with him while still having the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** I'm lowering the price from $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, allowing for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and how much he's willing to pay.

This counteroffer balances the need to be competitive while still aiming for a price that benefits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is too far below my threshold.

Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures I achieve my desired price and minimizes the risk of a lower final offer."
