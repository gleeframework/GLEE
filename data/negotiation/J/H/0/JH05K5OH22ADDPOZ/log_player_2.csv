"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way too high. I need to negotiate down significantly or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $5,000?"", ""product_price"": 5000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a very low offer to see how much Alice is willing to move. This leaves plenty of room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation to a lower price point. This might make Alice more receptive to a price closer to my budget later on. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer will give me a sense of how flexible Alice is on price and how the rest of the negotiation might go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is coming down, $17,000 is still too high for me. I'll need to continue negotiating or consider John's offer more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can do. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:**  I'm making a substantial increase from my last offer to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Approaching My Limit:** This offer is very close to my walk-away point of $8,000 (John's price). 
* **Clear Communication:** I'm being very direct with Alice that $7,000 is my top price. This hopefully encourages her to accept or make a realistic counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? This would be my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $12,000 is a much better price, it's still significantly higher than my backup option. Alice calling this her ""final offer"" suggests she might not move much further.  I'll try one last time to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me. I understand this is your final offer, but I need the price to be closer to my budget. Would you consider $8,000? That's the absolute most I can offer. Otherwise, I'll have to go with a different option."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm matching John's price with this offer, signaling that this is my absolute limit.  I'm making it clear to Alice that I'm prepared to walk away if she doesn't accept.
* **Direct & Respectful:** I'm still being appreciative of her time and willingness to negotiate, even though I'm presenting a firm stance.
* **No More Room:** This eliminates further back-and-forth, forcing a decision from Alice.  It's now up to her to decide if she'd rather make the sale at this price or risk losing the deal."
