"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $175 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $140? This would be a great deal for you, and still allows me to make a fair profit.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. While $140 is closer, I'm aiming for a bit more savings. How about we settle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
