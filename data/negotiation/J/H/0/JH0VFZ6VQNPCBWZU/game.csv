"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  This price is still fair for me, and hopefully, it's a good deal for you too.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer, $11000 is still a little too high.  Would you be willing to come down to $9500? It's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
