"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  I understand this is a considerable difference, but I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is too far from what I can accept.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This represents a good compromise and gives us both room to make a deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
