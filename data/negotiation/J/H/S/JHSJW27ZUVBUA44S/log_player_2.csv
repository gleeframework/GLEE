Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is too far from what I can accept.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further,  but if she doesn't budge significantly, it's best to buy from John."
