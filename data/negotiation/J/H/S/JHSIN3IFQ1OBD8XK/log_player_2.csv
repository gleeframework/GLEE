{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to him, so he's starting with his maximum offer. This is likely to be rejected by Alice, but it establishes a clear starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,100,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob might be able to secure a deal closer to his maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $800,000 to $900,000, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. This price is still within his budget, but it's a significant jump from his initial offer, demonstrating his serious interest in acquiring the product. This counteroffer might encourage Alice to accept, or it might lead to further negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down further, $1,050,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better price. He's shown willingness to compromise, and Alice might be willing to come down further to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to negotiation while also maintaining a firm stance on his price limit."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $1,025,000, it's still outside of Bob's desired price range. There's still potential for Alice to reduce the price further, and Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer one last time, aiming to close the gap with Alice's offer. He's now only $50,000 away from Alice's price, signaling his serious intent to reach an agreement. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob might choose to buy from John, but he's still hoping for a final compromise with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $1,000,000, it's still outside of Bob's desired price range. Bob has already made significant concessions and reached his limit. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $800,000 and secure the product within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a more favorable price."
