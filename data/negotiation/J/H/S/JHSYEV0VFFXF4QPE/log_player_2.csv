# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $14000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering the value you see in it being worth $15000 to you. Let's make this deal happen!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to counter with an offer of $13000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for me. I hope this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now below your maximum price:** Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is within your budget of $15,000.
* **A good compromise:** The offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to both you and Alice. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:** While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer again, and you could end up paying the full $15,000 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price."
