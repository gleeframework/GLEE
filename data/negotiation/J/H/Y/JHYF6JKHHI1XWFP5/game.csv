"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm comfortable with.  To find a middle ground, I propose $875,000.  This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $785,000?",785000.0,Bob,4,
