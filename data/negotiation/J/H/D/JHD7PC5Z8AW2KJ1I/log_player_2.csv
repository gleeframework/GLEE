"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $750,000 to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.

Alice is negotiating, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'll make another counteroffer, moving closer to her price but still leaving room for bargaining."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

Alice has come down significantly, and this offer is now within a reasonable range of my target price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept the offer of $675,000."
