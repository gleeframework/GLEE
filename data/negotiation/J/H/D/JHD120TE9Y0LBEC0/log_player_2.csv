Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product. Its value to you is substantial, and I believe we can find a price that benefits both of us. My starting offer is $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a decent starting point, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing you have a backup option with John at $1,200,000 gives you leverage in negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still shows you're serious about purchasing the product.

* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm eager to make this deal work, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This would still give you a significant return on your investment, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable price:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and represents a significant savings from her initial offer. 
* **Potential for future profit:**  Even at this price, the product is likely to provide a good return on investment for you.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rounds and potentially a higher final price, or could result in Alice refusing to budge further. 

Accepting Alice's offer ensures a quick and efficient purchase within your budget."
