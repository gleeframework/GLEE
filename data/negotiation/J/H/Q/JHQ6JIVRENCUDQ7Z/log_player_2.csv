"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $90 is too close to my max of $100. I want to see if I can get it for closer to Alice's value of $80."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down to $88, which is within my budget and a good deal for me. I'll accept her offer."
