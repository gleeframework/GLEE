Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $15,000 might scare Bob away. This offer balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential reward of a higher sale price."
