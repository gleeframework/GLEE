"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm setting an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offers are likely to be influenced by this high starting point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is about gathering information about Bob's willingness to pay. His response will help me strategize for subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is above his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum. I need to see if I can negotiate him closer to my range. I'm willing to lose a few rounds to explore this possibility, especially since I have the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While your proposed price doesn't reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:** I'm making a substantial decrease of $250,000 to show Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal. However, I'm still well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not dropping too close to Bob's offer yet. I want to see if I can bring him up significantly before revealing more of my bottom line.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** This counteroffer aims to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation and encourage him to make a counteroffer closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:** Bob is clearly willing to move, which is a good sign. However, $1,750,000 is still below my minimum. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With six rounds left, I need to start applying more pressure and signal that my price floor is approaching. 

I'll use my next counteroffer to get closer to my minimum while still leaving a small margin for a final push from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and is a fair offer considering its potential."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, signaling some flexibility but also indicating I'm approaching my limit. 
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By stating this is a final offer (even though it's not technically my last possible move), I'm hoping to add a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. Considering the product's value and my financial situation, I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has presented his ""final offer,"" which is still significantly below my $1,850,000 offer. It seems unlikely he'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a failed negotiation, forcing me to accept John's offer later anyway.  I've already invested time and energy in these rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer, it's not worth the risk of ending up with a lower amount or dragging out the negotiation further."
