Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and whether he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $80.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I will need to make a counteroffer to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $85. This is still a bit higher than my minimum, but it shows good faith in continuing the negotiation.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial offer and my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $80.  While Bob has increased his offer to $75, it's still below my minimum value and I'm not convinced he'll go higher.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with, so it's the most logical choice at this point."
