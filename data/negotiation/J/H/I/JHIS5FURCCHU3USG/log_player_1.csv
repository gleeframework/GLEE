"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, as it's a reasonable markup on my minimum value of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still allows me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price to $130, which is still above my minimum value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while hopefully getting closer to a price both of us can agree on."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I'm hoping to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum value. To guarantee a sale and avoid potentially losing money, I will sell the product to John for $120."
