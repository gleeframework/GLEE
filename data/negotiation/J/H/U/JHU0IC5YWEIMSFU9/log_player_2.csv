# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $2,000,000, which is too expensive. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
