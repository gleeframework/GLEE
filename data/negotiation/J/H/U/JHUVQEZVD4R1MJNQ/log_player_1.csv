Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to test the waters and see how interested Bob is in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $95? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $112.50 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $100 even? It's a fair price and it works for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $100 is the product's worth to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating in the hopes of securing a better deal.  There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a good compromise. This would allow me to make a decent profit, while still being a fair price for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
