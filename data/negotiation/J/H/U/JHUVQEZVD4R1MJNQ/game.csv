"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about $95? That's a fair offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $112.50 for the product. This is a good compromise for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $100 even? It's a fair price and it works for my budget.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a good compromise. This would allow me to make a decent profit, while still being a fair price for you.",120.0,Alice,7,
