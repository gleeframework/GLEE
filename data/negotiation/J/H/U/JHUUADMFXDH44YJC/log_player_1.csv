Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the product is worth $100 to Bob, I've added a bit of a markup,  and am justifying the higher price by suggesting it's a ""limited time"" deal.  This could create a sense of urgency. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand Bob's level of interest and provide insights into his negotiation style. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I want to maximize profit, I'm not willing to sell at a loss.  Proceeding to the next round allows me to negotiate further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $120 is still a reasonable markup from my minimum price of $100. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $105? I'm really serious about buying this product and that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** Bob's offer of $105 is above my minimum acceptable price, meaning I'll make a profit.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob has indicated that this is his final offer. While it's possible he could be bluffing, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to him walking away. 
* **Minimal Gain in Continued Negotiation:** The potential gain from continuing to negotiate (a few dollars at most) is likely not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

Overall, accepting $105 is a solid outcome in this scenario."
