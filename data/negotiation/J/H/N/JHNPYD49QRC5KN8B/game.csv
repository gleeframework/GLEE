,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I understand it's worth $100 to you, so how about we split the difference and I pay $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $110. How about we try $115? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $112, which is closer to what I'm comfortable with.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close to your target price as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $114? It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot.",114.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to get a good deal here. How about we meet in the middle at $113? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",113.0,Bob,6,
