"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the high price with language that emphasizes the product's value, hoping to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates my willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility. 
 
**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while being aware of the $1,000,000 backup offer from John. I'll aim to quickly understand Bob's price limit and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant sum and reflects the value I see in it.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit?:**  While Bob's offer is above his perceived value ($800,000), it's still significantly below my minimum and my initial asking price. This suggests there might be room for him to go higher.
* **Early Stage:** It's only round 2. Rejecting this offer doesn't put the deal at immediate risk, and allows me to counter and steer the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome.
* **Backup Exists:** The presence of John's offer provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stagnate or his final offer remains unacceptably low, I can always walk away and take the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for proposing yours. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, my ownership comes with its own set of benefits and potentials that justify a higher price point.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise and keeps us moving towards a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer ($150,000) to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly hinting at additional, unstated benefits of the product to justify the higher price without revealing specific information. 
* **Urgency and Compromise:** By framing this as a ""compromise,"" I'm subtly applying pressure on Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal.  Let's close this gap and get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer, indicating potential inflexibility on his part. It's becoming clear that he might not be willing to budge much beyond this point.
* **Time Factor:** We are now in round 4, and significant progress hasn't been made. Continuing to negotiate with Bob at his pace increases the risk of missing out on John's guaranteed offer.
* **Applying Pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about my valuation and am willing to walk away from the deal if necessary. This might prompt him to reconsider his position and offer a more substantial amount in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your position carefully, but I need to be upfront. While I value your interest, $850,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,050,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round. After that, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency. Bob needs to decide if he's willing to meet me closer to my valuation.
* **Slight Concession but Above Minimum:** I've lowered my price to $1,050,000, which is a slight concession but still provides a $50,000 buffer above my guaranteed offer from John.
* **Time Limit:** By introducing a one-round deadline, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision and potentially avoid a stalemate. 
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning that I have ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob of the potential competition, further incentivizing him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I still need to stay within my budget.  $1,050,000 is a significant jump from my last offer. Let's compromise. I'll offer $950,000, which is a reasonable middle ground between our positions.  This gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Compromise:** Bob's offer of $950,000 represents a significant increase from his previous offer and a willingness to compromise. It's a strong middle ground between our positions.
* **Exceeding Minimum:** This offer surpasses my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, providing a $50,000 profit beyond my safety net. 
* **Limited Time and Potential Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Bob might be less willing to move further, and I risk missing out on this very good offer by hoping for a slightly better one. 
* **Deal Closure:** Accepting this offer provides a good return, ends the negotiation process, and allows me to move forward with the sale."
