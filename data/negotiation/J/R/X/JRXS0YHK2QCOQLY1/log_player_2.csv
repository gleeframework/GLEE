# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. In order to move forward, I am willing to consider a compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the ongoing dialogue and the value you place on the product, I am prepared to offer $890,000. This proposal aims to strike a balance between recognizing the product's worth and accommodating your financial considerations. I hope this offer meets your expectations and paves the way for a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  We've already gone through a few rounds, and while I could continue negotiating, there's a chance we'll hit an impasse.  I'd rather secure the product at a price that's still within my budget.  Also, with only 5 rounds left, it's getting riskier to keep pushing and risk ending up paying the full $1,000,000 to John."
