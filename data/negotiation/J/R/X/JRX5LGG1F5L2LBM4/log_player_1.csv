"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it right away. This sets the stage for a negotiation and helps me explore if there's any wiggle room in his $8,000 valuation.  I'll be ready to adjust my price depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get closer to my minimum value of $10,000.  While $9,500 is tempting, I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the remaining rounds.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob's offer was closer to my minimum price. However, it's still a substantial amount for me, and I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair offer. If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options more carefully in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm not confident that he'll budge further, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering my minimum price of $10,000.  It's time to see if Bob is truly willing to meet me at my bottom line. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. While Bob's offer is close to his estimated value of the product, it's below my minimum price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable agreement. Selling to John guarantees me the price I need, and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or losing time in further negotiations."
