"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so you have some room to negotiate."
