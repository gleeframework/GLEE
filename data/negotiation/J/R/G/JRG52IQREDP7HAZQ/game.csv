"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true value.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I understand your offer, the $800,000 price point doesn't reflect its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant amount for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
