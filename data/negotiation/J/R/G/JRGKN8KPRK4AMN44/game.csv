"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has great potential, that initial price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet closer to the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  How about $1,387,500?  I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the value and my budget.",1387500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I see your point about budget considerations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,625,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting tough! You drive a hard bargain. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $1,625,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we split the difference and land at $1,500,000? That's my best and final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
