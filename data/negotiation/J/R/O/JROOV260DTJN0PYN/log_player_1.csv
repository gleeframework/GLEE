Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than $8,000, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher counteroffer from Bob."

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and more than what John is offering.  I'm also feeling a bit weary of the negotiation process and want to finalize the sale."
