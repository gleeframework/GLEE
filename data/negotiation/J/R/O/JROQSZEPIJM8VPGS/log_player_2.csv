"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is closer to Alice's value but still allows for some potential profit for her.  It's a reasonable starting point that shows you're willing to negotiate while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price for me. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, and I risk her walking away. This price is significantly better than buying from John, so accepting is the best decision at this point."
