Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum acceptable price:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, he might be willing to pay a bit more than your asking price, allowing for potential profit for you. 
* **Sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if you can reach a price that is more favorable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth more to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing him as a buyer altogether. Selling to John guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that you can find a better buyer in the future."
