Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the thoughtfulness. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm hoping to get even closer to $1,500,000.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than my ideal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to drop my price a little further to $1,350,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a good deal for me. It's close to my minimum acceptable price, and Bob seems to be getting closer to his maximum willingness to pay. I'm ready to close the deal."
