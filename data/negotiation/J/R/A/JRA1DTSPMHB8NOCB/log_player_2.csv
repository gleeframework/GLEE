"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. This is a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
