"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by us due to its high quality and unique features. Given your interest and assessment of its value at $80, I propose we meet in the middle. How about an offer of $95? I believe this price reflects both our perspectives and could be beneficial for both of us.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given your value of $120 and my value of $80, I'm willing to go up to $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
