{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate while still ensuring you earn a decent amount.  I'm also adding a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on $9,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum value.  Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $8700 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, and it's likely that further negotiation will take too much time. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a price that's not far off from what I'd get from John."
