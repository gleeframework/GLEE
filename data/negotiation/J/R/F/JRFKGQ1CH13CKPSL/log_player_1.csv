Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as much profit as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than her backup option (John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($9,500) leaves room for Bob to negotiate or for Alice to slightly reduce the price while still staying above her minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not lose out on a potentially good deal. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price while still making it attractive enough for him to consider."
