,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit too high for me. I can offer $950000. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $950000 is still too low. I'm willing to make a final concession. How about we settle at $1000000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. This is my final offer. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
