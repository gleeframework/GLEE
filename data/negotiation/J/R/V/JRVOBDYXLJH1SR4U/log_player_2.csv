"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible and he's willing to go to another seller.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's comfort zone.  He's determined to get the best price possible and knows he has the option to buy from John for $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $14,000.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm thinking of $13500. It's as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, he's still determined to get a better deal.  He knows John is a backup option, and he wants to see if he can get Alice down further. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering keeps the negotiation open and potentially saves him more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $13,200?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13200, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll throw in a free maintenance package, which is worth $1000. So, I'll sell the product to you for $12200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to Bob's target price of $10,000.  The free maintenance package adds value, making the deal even better. While there's always the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer, it's highly likely that she won't budge any further.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product and save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John."
