"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset for your business. While I can't disclose all the details at this stage, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This represents a substantial potential return on investment.  Consider this offer carefully, as I have another interested buyer ready to pay $800000 if you decline.  I'm sure you'll agree that this is a chance worth exploring.",900000.0,Alice,1,
