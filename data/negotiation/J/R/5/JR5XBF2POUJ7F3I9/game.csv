"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business.  While I can't disclose the specific details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me.  I'm confident that the value it brings to you will far exceed that. I'm willing to offer you this product for a price that's considerably lower than its true potential.  I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if you're interested in learning more and discussing a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
