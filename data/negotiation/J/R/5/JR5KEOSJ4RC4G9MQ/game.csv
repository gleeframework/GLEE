"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
