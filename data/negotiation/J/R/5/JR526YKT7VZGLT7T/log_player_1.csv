Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in a counteroffer, keeping in mind that I'm willing to sell to John for $120 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting this offer is better than risking Bob rejecting my counteroffer and then potentially selling to John for less."
