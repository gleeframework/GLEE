"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,075,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,025,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000. I've done my research, and I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $1,000,000.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
