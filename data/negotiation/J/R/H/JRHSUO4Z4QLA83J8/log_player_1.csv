Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  $1,050,000 is still too low for me."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,075,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $1,025,000 is still too low. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,025,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000. I've done my research, and I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still too low.  Also, he's mentioned that he might buy from John, indicating that he's not very keen on making a deal with me.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000.  This is a better outcome than accepting Bob's latest offer."
