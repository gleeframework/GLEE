Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Since you have a backup offer, you can aim slightly higher than your minimum. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and presents a fair opportunity for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's positive, acknowledges the product's value to Bob, and positions the price as carefully considered. 
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 leaves a good profit margin for you while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value. It gives him a strong incentive to accept rather than risk losing out. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his response."
