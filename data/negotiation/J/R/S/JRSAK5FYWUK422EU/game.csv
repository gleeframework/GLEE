"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $800000 is lower than my expectation, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's consider $1400000.  This is still a good deal for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be satisfied with this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is still significantly below my minimum.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to drop to $1200000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize this transaction. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1150000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000, which is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finally close this deal. Let's make it happen!",1100000.0,Bob,8,
