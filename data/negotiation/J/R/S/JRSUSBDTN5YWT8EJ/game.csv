"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is a bit beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair given the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
