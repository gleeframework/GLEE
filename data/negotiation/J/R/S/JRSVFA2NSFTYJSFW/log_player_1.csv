I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it's still above Bob's estimated value, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for less than $1,300,000.  I'll send him a counteroffer."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise."

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000.  It's better for me to sell to John and guarantee a higher price."
