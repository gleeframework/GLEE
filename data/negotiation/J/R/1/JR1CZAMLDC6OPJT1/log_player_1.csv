Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
