"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and gives us both a good profit margin.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $775000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges its value while staying within my budget. I'm confident this is a win-win situation that will allow both of us to be happy with the transaction.

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
