"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000. I can do $1,600,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I can meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm willing to do $1,475,000. That's the best I can do.",1475000.0,Alice,5,,
