"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price of $120, knowing that Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, as I'm willing to sell for at least $80.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm trying to build rapport by starting with a friendly message and emphasizing my belief that Bob would find the product valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for that low. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Low Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far below my minimum.
* **Counter-Offering:** I'm making a counter-offer of $100, which is still higher than my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to justify my price. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  I'm emphasizing a desire to find a mutually agreeable price, encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is slightly below my initial goal, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. Given that I've already rejected Bob's offer twice, continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is a good outcome considering the limited number of rounds."
