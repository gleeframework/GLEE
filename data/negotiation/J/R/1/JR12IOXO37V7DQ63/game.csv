"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a good deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000? This still leaves some room for profit for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $1,275,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I think it represents a good compromise for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum threshold. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
