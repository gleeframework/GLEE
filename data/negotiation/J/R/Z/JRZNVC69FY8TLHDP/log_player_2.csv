"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be just as valuable to you. Given its importance, I'm proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly.  However, my budget for this type of item is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer for the product is $8,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is $8,500, which is still higher than John's price of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price, so it's better to secure the product from John at the lowest possible price."
