**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, and I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  While I could try to squeeze out a little more, I'm concerned about potentially losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and still save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
