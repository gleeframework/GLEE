"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll find it really useful. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and doesn't immediately alienate Bob.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning the product's potential usefulness to Bob subtly emphasizes its worth. 

I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to negotiate from my starting point. If he rejects, we'll move on to subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate and acknowledges the product's value. 
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a lower price in the next round, hoping to find a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $95? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **""Good Deal"" Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefit for both of us, making it more appealing. 
* **Strategic Price:**  $95 is still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 

I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more like $85. It's a great product, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Despite the lower offer, Bob is still engaged and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential to increase price:** I believe I can still increase the price further.

I am rejecting Bob's offer because it is below my minimum price. I will continue to negotiate in hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my price.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I reiterate my position that $85 is too low while still showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I remind Bob of the product's quality to justify the higher price.
* **Compromise Focus:** I emphasize finding a ""compromise"" to make the offer more appealing.

I'm hoping that by sticking to my minimum price and emphasizing the value for Bob, we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $87, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and he's indicated that's his final offer. 
* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $100.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on any profit.  Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point."
