"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your absolute minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high starting price, even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Openness:**  The message expresses openness to discussion, signaling that you're willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Establish a high reference point in Bob's mind.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to understand his price sensitivity and potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research, I believe a fair price for this product would be $1,300,000.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your desired amount. 

By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a better offer and keep the negotiation alive. You'll aim to bring Bob closer to your target price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique and positions you for significant gains in the long run.  Considering that, I could come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's real worth."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Strategically:**  While moving closer to Bob's offer, the counter-offer still maintains a significant margin above your minimum. The decrease shows flexibility while keeping the negotiation active.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reinforces the product's value proposition, emphasizing long-term benefits to justify the higher price.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtly):** By stating this offer ""reflects the product's real worth,"" you subtly imply this is a strong offer, potentially encouraging Bob to consider it more seriously.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Test Bob's Flexibility:** See if he's willing to move substantially from his initial offer.
2. **Maintain Control:** Avoid drastic price drops that might weaken your negotiating position. 
3. **Keep the Door Open:** Continue the dialogue and explore if a mutually beneficial agreement is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $1,600,000.  This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* Reduce his offer
* Walk away from the deal

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
