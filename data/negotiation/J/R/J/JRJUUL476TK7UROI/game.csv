"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, as it's well below its true market value.  I know you're interested, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer lined up for $1,000,000 if you decline.",900000.0,Alice,1,
