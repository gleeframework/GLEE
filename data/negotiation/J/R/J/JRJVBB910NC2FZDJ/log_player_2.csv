"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($65), I'm aiming to establish a negotiation range that's more favorable to me. This leaves room to gradually increase my offer if needed.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is crafted to be polite and express my interest while clearly indicating that the initial price is a dealbreaker."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $85, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a bit, but we're still not in a range I'm fully comfortable with. There's room for more negotiation, and I'm willing to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** I've increased my offer to $75, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet closer to Alice's price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Framing:**  This common negotiation tactic suggests fairness and encourages Alice to also make a concession.
* **Still Below John's Price:** My offer remains significantly below John's $100 asking price, keeping me in a strong negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do $82.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really think you'll love this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to $80 as possible, but I think there's still room to negotiate.  The difference between her offer and John's price is shrinking, but it's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can settle closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to make this work if we can find a price that works for both of us. What about $78? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Fair Offer:**  $78 is a strong offer that splits the difference between our previous offers.  It's significantly closer to her likely bottom line ($80) while still giving me a good deal.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,""  I'm signaling that I'm serious and unlikely to budge much further. This adds pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. By being firm but fair, I'm aiming to close the deal without having to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there at $78, Bob. I can do $82, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $82, and I'm already getting a decent discount.
* **Time Constraint:** We're running out of rounds. If I keep pushing and we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to buy from John for $100, which is a worse outcome. 
* **Good Deal Overall:**  $82 is still $18 less than John's offer, representing a good deal on the product."
