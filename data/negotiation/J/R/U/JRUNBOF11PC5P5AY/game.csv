"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13,800?",13800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to be close to your minimum price, but $13,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,400.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13400.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,600, but I think I can do better than that. How about we meet at $13,900?",13900.0,Alice,5,
