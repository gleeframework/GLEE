,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $85?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $90 to $85, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $85. How about $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
