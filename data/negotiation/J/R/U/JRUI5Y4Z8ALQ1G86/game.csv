"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for a profitable margin. Let's start the conversation!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for my business.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This gives you a significant return on your investment and ensures I receive a fair price for my product. ",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not convinced that $1,550,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,450,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're close on price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000.  This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to your business is closer to $1,500,000. Let's bridge the gap - I'm willing to accept $1,475,000 for a final price. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it'll lead to a mutually beneficial deal.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
