"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal you're offering, it's a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm happy to buy the product from you for $750000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a healthy profit and me a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that should benefit both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial outcome.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position.",825000.0,Alice,5,
