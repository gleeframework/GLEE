Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that should benefit both of us.

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. I'm still confident I can get the product for less than $850,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can understand my position. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, but it's only $25,000 more than my last counteroffer.  I've been persistent in negotiating, and it seems like this is her final offer. It's a better deal than buying from John, and getting the product for $825,000 is still a good deal for me."
