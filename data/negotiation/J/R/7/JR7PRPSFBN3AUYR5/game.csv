"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to your operations. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a substantial opportunity to gain a significant edge in your market. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details further. However, if you decline this offer, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $1,000,000.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
