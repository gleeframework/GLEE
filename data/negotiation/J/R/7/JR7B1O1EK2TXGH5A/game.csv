"Thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product. I understand its value, but I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to move down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering its unique value proposition.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the product's value, I still feel that $1,300,000 is too high. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
