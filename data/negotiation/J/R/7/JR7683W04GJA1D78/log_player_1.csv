"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering my maximum is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your position, $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move substantially closer to my $1,000,000 minimum. He's incrementally increasing his offers, but I can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John right now. It's better to take the guaranteed profit than risk Bob not meeting my valuation in the remaining rounds."
