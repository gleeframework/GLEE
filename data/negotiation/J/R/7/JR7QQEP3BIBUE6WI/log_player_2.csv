"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
