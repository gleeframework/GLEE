"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
