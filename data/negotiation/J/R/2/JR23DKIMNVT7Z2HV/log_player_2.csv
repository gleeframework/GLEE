"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much better to negotiate or take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message expresses continued interest while firmly stating our budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $9,000 is still above our $8,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice explicitly stated she's open to further negotiation. This implies we might be able to get the price closer to, or even at, our target. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice won't budge much further, but the potential reward of saving $1,000 by negotiating is worth another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $7,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counter-offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between her $9,000 and our previous $6,000.
* **Sense of Urgency (Slight):** By offering a specific number and calling it ""fair,"" we are subtly increasing pressure without being aggressive.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** We're still below our $8,000 maximum, giving us a small buffer if Alice pushes back a little."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500, which would be $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margins. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Close Enough:** Alice is getting closer to our $8,000 limit, but she's made it clear that $8,250 is her absolute lowest.  
* **John's Offer is Better:** At this point, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000, saving us $250 compared to Alice's final price. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting John's offer allows us to move on quickly."
