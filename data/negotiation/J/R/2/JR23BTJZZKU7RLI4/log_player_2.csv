"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $90. It's a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can get her down to a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down to $90. However, I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $85.  Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product for $85, but I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $87.50, which is still a good deal for me. It's only $7.50 more than what it's worth to her, and I'm saving $12.50 compared to buying from John. I'll accept her offer."
