"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, so I'm going to reject it. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum value, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable price for Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to reach a price that is both fair and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $16,000.  This is still above my minimum value and shows continued flexibility in negotiations. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'm feeling confident that I can get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $15,500. This is only $500 above my minimum value, and it's a strong indication that I'm serious about getting a deal done with Bob. With only a few rounds left, I need to be assertive while still showing some flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $200 below what John is willing to pay, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's likely that we won't get a higher offer from Bob. Therefore, it's best to accept his offer and secure a sale."
