Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm, but we're still in the early rounds and his offer is far below both the product's value to me and my fallback option (John). I'll counter-offer again to test his resolve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  While I'm committed to finding a solution, I need you to meet me closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise and a testament to my desire to close this deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to close the deal, but $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob remains anchored to his initial offer, but it's still early in the negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll decrease my concessions to signal I'm nearing my limit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your consistency, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,450,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $800,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge from his $800,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome.  It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  This ensures a guaranteed profit without further risk or wasted time."
