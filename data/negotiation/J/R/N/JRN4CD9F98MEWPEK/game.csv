"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure a fair return on this valuable product.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a solution, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't meet my needs. I'm willing to bridge the gap a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this unique product.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and it's very close to my minimum.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
