You should reject Alice's offer. It's better to try and get a lower price. You have the option of getting it for $150 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

It's better to accept Alice's offer of $130. You're still getting a better deal than buying from John for $150. You can't be sure if Alice will continue to lower the price or not, so it's safer to accept her current offer."
