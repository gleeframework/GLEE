Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and it represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's close this deal.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,050,000, and it's better to secure the product from John at $1,000,000 than risk the negotiation failing altogether."
