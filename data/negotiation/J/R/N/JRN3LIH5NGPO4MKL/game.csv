"Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering the market value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $900,000. This offer represents a serious commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  That's a significant move on my part and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.  Let me know if you're open to it.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and it represents a significant compromise on my part. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
