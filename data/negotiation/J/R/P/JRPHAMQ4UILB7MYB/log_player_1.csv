"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that signals my belief in the product's value. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his initial willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial price. While $1,600,000 is still above my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm offering $1,800,000. This is a compromise, but it still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and move closer to my desired selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I've already had two rounds of negotiations and he's not showing much willingness to move.  Rather than risk further rounds with a potential stalemate, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John.  It's better to lock in a sale now than risk losing both buyers."
