"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000. This offer is closer to my budget and allows us to close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
