Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.

```tool_code
print(""Reason:I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below $100. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within my budget."")

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.
