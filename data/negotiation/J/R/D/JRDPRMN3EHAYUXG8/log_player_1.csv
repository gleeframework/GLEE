{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be very beneficial for your needs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me is $12000. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum goal, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident he values the product enough to potentially come up a bit more, and I want to maximize my profit.  

By rejecting his counteroffer, I can make a new counteroffer in the next round and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,750?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my desired price range, and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.  While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely or getting a lower price later.  

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
