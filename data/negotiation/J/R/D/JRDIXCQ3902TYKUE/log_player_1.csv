Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my ideal price. It also recognizes that the product has value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is below my minimum threshold of $15,000, and I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $16,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I believe it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a worse deal with Bob is high. It's best to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
