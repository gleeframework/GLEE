"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1100000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints. I'm thinking of offering $900000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
