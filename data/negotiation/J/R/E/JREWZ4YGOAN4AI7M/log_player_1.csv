Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value of your product, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a respectable amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and can still make a counteroffer or sell to John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my original asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject the offer and keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds left and can always sell to John if I need to."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
