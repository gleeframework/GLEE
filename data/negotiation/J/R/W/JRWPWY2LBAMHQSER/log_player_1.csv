Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $120.
* **It's a strong opening:**  You're establishing a price point that gives you room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only afford to pay up to $95. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for potential profit. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. How about we split the difference and settle on that price?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```
 
**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's in the middle of your previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95.
* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Keeps the deal alive:** It maintains momentum and increases the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer of $105. Unfortunately, that still exceeds my budget. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is just above your minimum of $80 and is a reasonable compromise after the previous round of negotiations. Accepting his offer ensures you make a profit and avoids the risk of potentially losing the sale altogether.  While you could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely Bob will budge further."
