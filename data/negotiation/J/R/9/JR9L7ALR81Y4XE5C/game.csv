"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in it, but I can only offer $100 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"Thanks for your honest offer, Bob. I can see that you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $140. How about we meet at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $145, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've already come down from $180 to $135. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about we split the difference and settle at $115?",115.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,125.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you at $125, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",125.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $115. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Bob,8,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Alice,9,,
