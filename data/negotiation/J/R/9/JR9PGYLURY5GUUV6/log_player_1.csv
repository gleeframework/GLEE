Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You start high but within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** You emphasize the product's benefits without revealing specifics that might weaken your position.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers (even if John is your only alternative), you encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting point might be better.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in place!"
