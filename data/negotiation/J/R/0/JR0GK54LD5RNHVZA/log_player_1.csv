Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring we get at least $120 if he accepts outright. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a fallback option with John."
