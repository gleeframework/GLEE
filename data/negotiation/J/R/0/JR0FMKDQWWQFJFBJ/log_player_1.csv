Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $10,000 because it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

**Here's why I've chosen this strategy:**

* **High initial offer:** This allows for more room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Positive and enthusiastic message:**  This can encourage Bob to engage with the offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  
    * If he accepts, great!
    * If he rejects, analyze his counteroffer (if any) and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
    * If he rejects without a counteroffer, or you don't feel like negotiating further, you can always go with John's offer of $8,000.

Remember, the key is to find a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and make a counteroffer in the next round.  Here's why:

* **My minimum:**  My minimum selling price is $8,000, and Bob's offer is below that.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.

I'll aim for a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny for you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Maintaining momentum:**  I want to keep the negotiation going and avoid going with John's offer yet. 

Now, it's time to see if Bob will accept my counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $8000, which is closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept Bob's offer**.  Here's why:

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum selling price.
* **No further negotiation:** I've already gone down from my initial offer, and further negotiation might risk losing Bob altogether.
* **Time is money:**  It's important to make a decision, as John's offer is still available, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale.

This outcome is a good result, as it allows me to sell the product for my minimum value and avoid any further negotiation."
