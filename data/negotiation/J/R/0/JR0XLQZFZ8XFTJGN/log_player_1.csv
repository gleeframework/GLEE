Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm a savvy buyer and I've done my research, and I believe the product is worth less than what you're asking for. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
