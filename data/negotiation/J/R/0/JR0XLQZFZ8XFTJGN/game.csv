"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm a savvy buyer and I've done my research, and I believe the product is worth less than what you're asking for. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle for $8750? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise for me. Let's make this happen!",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $8000. I'm thinking we could meet at $8200. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8200.0,Bob,4,
