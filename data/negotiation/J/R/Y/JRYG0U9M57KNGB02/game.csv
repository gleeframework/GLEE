"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too far below my initial offer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $1,350,000 is a fair compromise. This price still allows for a significant profit for you while giving me a reasonable return on my investment. Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and ensures a reasonable return for me. Let's finalize this deal and both benefit from it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. I believe this is the best we can do to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer. How about $1,285,000? That's a reasonable compromise that gets us both closer to a deal.  Let's close this transaction and move on to the benefits this product offers you.",1285000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,285,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
