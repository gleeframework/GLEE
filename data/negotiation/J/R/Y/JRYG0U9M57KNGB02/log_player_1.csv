Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try and counter with a price that's still attractive to Bob but gets me closer to $1,400,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit too far below my initial offer.

Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe we can still reach a higher price.  I'm going to try and counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
