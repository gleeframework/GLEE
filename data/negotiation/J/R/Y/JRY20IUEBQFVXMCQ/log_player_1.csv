"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more, but I'm also prepared to lower the price if necessary to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired range of $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob, considering he values the product at $12,000, while also allowing me to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,800 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a more aggressive price, pushing towards my original desired range while still considering Bob's counteroffer.  This shows my commitment to negotiating a fair price, but it also sets a firm limit for the deal. If Bob rejects this, I might be ready to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,600 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again, but if Bob rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's latest offer.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob has been very persistent in his negotiation, but the price he's offering is just below my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to make a profit higher than $8,000, it's important to close the deal and secure a sale. I'm confident that John will be a good buyer and the transaction will be smooth."
