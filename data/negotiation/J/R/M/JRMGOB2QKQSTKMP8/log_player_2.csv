Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at $13,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob should buy from John.  He's been negotiating with Alice for several rounds, and while they've both come down in price, they haven't reached a point where Alice is willing to sell for less than Bob's maximum.  John is offering the product for the exact amount Bob is willing to pay, so it's a better option to avoid further negotiation and save time."
