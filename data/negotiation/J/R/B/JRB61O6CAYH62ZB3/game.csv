"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
