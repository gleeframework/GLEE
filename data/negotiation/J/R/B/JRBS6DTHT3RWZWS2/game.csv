"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for working with me.  $7,250 is close, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to do $7,000?  That's my final offer.",7000.0,Bob,6,
