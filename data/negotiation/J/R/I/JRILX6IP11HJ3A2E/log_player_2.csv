"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's worth a lot more than that to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
