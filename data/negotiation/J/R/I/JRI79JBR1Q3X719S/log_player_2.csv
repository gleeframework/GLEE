"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is too high.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Polite and Interested:** I want to maintain a positive tone and express my interest in the product.  This might encourage Alice to work with me. 
* **Targeting Value:** My ideal price point is closer to $12,000 (Alice's value), not my maximum of $15,000. I'm aiming to get a good deal, not just secure the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to her actual value for the product, which is a good sign. However,  $12,500 is still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer with a price slightly below hers to see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice!  How about we settle on $11,500? I think that's fair for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm moving closer to Alice's counteroffer by offering $11,500, but I'm not yet meeting her halfway point.
* **Seeking Compromise:** My message aims to convey that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Deadline Awareness:** While I have several rounds left, I want to make progress and secure a price significantly below my $15,000 alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $11,500. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm closer to her initial offer.  While $13,000 is better than her first offer, it's still above my target price.  I need to show I'm serious about a lower price or consider buying from John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I need to be realistic about my budget. $12,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're not able to meet that, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding my ground at $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. My message is direct but not aggressive.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice about John's offer without making a direct threat.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and I want Alice to know I'm serious about my budget and the possibility of walking away."
