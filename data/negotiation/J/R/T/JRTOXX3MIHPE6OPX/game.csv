"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right at your desired value.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
