Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still allows room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping a backup option in place."
