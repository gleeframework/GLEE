# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also ensures a fair profit margin for us. Considering its worth to you is $100, this could be an excellent opportunity for both of us. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget.
