Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I can definitely push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, $1,300,000 is a much fairer price.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a budget of $1,200,000. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're still above my minimum of $1,000,000, so I can afford to keep negotiating.  I want to try and get closer to $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for you, and we can finalize the sale quickly."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
