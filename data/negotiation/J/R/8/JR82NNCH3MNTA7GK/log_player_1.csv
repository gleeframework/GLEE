{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still a fair profit for me. I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still not happy with that price. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try for a counteroffer closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm proposing $95 as a compromise. This is still a fair price for me, and it's only $5 more than Bob's offer. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $92 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than I need to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me at $94? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 94}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $94. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still a good deal for him, and it gets me closer to my target price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a bit more savings. I'm willing to go up to $91, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and Bob keeps inching up his offer, but it's not getting close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I'm getting frustrated with the back-and-forth.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'll take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $120.  It's a better deal for me, and I can move on to other things."
