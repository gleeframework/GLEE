Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to start with this offer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,750,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear that we are unlikely to bridge the gap quickly.  Accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit. It's in my best interest to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
