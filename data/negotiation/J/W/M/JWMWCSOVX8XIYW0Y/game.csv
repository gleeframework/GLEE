"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a price that's closer to my value. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,250 to make this work. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving forward with another buyer.  Let me know what you decide.",11250.0,Alice,5,
