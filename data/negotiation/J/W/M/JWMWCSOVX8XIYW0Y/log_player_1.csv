{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers and provides space for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Considering John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, it's risky to rely solely on him.  Negotiating with Bob first could lead to a faster sale or a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If not, consider his counteroffer.
* **Adjust Strategy:** Depending on Bob's response, I may adjust my price or counteroffer strategy.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** If negotiations stall and I feel John's offer is more secure, I'll switch to selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob is interested, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's Offer Remains Attractive:**  John's offer of $12,000 is a safe fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer Bob:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or at least closer to my minimum. 
* **Monitor Negotiation:**  I'll assess Bob's responses to my counteroffers and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Don't Rush:** It's important to avoid accepting a low price just because Bob is interested. I have a strong alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a price that's closer to my value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob by mentioning that it's a ""good deal"" for him.
* **Clear & Concise:**  My message is straightforward and concise, making it easy for Bob to understand my position.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to reassess my strategy based on his next offer.
* **Prepare for a Potential Final Offer:** If Bob doesn't agree, I might have to make a final counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, or consider accepting John's offer. 
* **Stay Firm:**  I'm aware that John's offer is a strong alternative, so I won't be pressured into accepting a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $12,000 remains a strong and reliable option. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  I can still counteroffer Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range. However, there's a risk of a lengthy negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a final counteroffer, likely closer to my initial offer of $11,500.
* **Finality:** I'll make it clear that this is my final counteroffer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll move forward with John's offer.
* **Focus on John:**  My priority now is to secure a sale that meets my minimum price, and John offers that."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,250 to make this work.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm clearly stating this is my final counteroffer to avoid further back-and-forth.
