"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80. How about we try $85? It's a fair compromise that still gets you a great deal on the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get it down to $82. Can you consider that?",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $82. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet in the middle between $85 and $82? That would put the price at $83.50. It's a fair compromise that still gets you a great deal on the product.",83.5,Alice,5,
