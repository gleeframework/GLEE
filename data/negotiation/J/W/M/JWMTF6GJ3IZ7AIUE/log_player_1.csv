{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible while still enticing Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 gives us a starting point. Any offer below that will be accepted but leaves money on the table.
* **John's Guarantee:**  John's willingness to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net.  If Bob declines, we don't lose out.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $950,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price while still staying significantly above his valuation and giving Alice a substantial profit.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball."
