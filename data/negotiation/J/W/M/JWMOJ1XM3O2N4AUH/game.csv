"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point considering its potential worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $900,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I could be persuaded to come down to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, I need to get at least $1,000,000 for this to make sense for me.  This is my final offer, so what do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to compromise further, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,6,
