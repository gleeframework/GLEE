"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your maximum budget of $80. You can get a better deal from John for $80, so it makes sense to buy from him."
