"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $7,500 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,250?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire it.",8250.0,Alice,3,
