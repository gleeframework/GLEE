"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible and is willing to pay up to $120. Alice's initial offer of $140 is higher than Bob's maximum, so rejecting it and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer you $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so he's offering the lowest price he's willing to pay while still staying within his budget.
* **Reasonable offer:** $125 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, allowing room for compromise while still keeping the offer within Bob's acceptable range. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and respectful, acknowledging Alice's offer while stating Bob's position clearly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $132? That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still aiming for a lower cost. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $132 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $130, which is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incrementally closer:** Bob is moving incrementally closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Still within budget:** $130 is still within Bob's maximum price limit. 
* **Framing:** Bob frames this offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and respectful, reiterating Bob's desire to reach an agreement."
