"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let you have it for $95. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **Your Maximum:** $100
* **John's Price:** $100

While Alice's offer is within your budget, you know John will sell it to you for $100. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or buying it from John at your maximum price."
