Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $1,000,000. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so this is a high starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, I'm aware I can always sell to John for my target price, so I'm not under pressure to settle for anything less than $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to his valuation than my initial offer, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's valuation.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. It's closer to my target price than his previous offer, and it's also a fair price for Bob. It's better to get a good price now than risk delaying the sale and losing out on a potential deal."
