"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's valuation. This gives me some room for negotiation and also shows that I am confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $14,000. It's worth risking one more round of negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,800. This is a small concession from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for potential profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,600. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're now four rounds in, and the negotiations are getting closer to a resolution. Accepting this offer will secure a profit above my minimum valuation, and I'm comfortable with this outcome."
