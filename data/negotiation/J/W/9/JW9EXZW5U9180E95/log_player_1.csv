Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below the product's value to Bob:**  Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust the price slightly lower in a counteroffer, or you can use his counteroffer to gauge his willingness to pay. 

Remember, the goal is to get the best price, but you also want to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is not the ideal price, it's still a good profit for you, and it's very likely that Bob will not offer any higher. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether, especially with John as a backup option. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option."
