"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's well below market value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to get a good deal here. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up to $9,900.  I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,900 is still not quite there for me.  Let's meet at $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
