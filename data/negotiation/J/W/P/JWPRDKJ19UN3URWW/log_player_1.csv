"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's well below market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* I'm emphasizing the value proposition by mentioning the product is ""well below market value"".
* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum.  It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter-proposal.
* I'm aiming for a price that is still above Bob's valuation but closer to my target.
* I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially leading to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to get a good deal here. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it's still below my target.  I have the opportunity to negotiate further, aiming for a better deal without risking selling to John immediately. There's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,250. This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter-proposal that's only $250 more than his offer.
* I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price again, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* I'm still leaving room for negotiation in case Bob is hesitant, but I'm getting closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come up to $9,900.  I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,900 is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John, so it makes sense to keep negotiating with Bob. There are still four rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,900 is still not quite there for me.  Let's meet at $10,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering a price that is only $100 higher than Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the deal, emphasizing that it benefits both parties.
* I'm expressing the desire to ""close the transaction,"" implying that further negotiation may be unproductive.
* I'm aiming to reach a final agreement in this round, getting closer to my target price while still being within a reasonable range for Bob."
