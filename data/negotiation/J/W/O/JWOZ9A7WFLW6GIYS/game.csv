"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  My starting price is $1,200,000, which reflects its true worth. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that accounts for both our needs. Let's get this deal done.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
