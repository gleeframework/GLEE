"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8200 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8800? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8800 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8800 and $8200, so how about $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
