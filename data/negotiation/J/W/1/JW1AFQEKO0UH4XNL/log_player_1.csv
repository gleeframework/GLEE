"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves me a good profit margin. This is a good starting point to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely do better. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm raising the price just a little bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product, but I'm also open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $800 less than my ideal price, and it's significantly better than selling to John.  I'm accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a good profit."
