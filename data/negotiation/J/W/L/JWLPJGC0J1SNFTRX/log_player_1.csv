Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $12,000, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I could start at $12,000, a slightly lower offer of $10,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit.
* **Time Value and Certainty:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the potential delay of going to John. This offer aims for a win-win: a good deal for Bob and a quick, profitable sale for me."
