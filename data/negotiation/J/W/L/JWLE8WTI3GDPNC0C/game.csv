"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product, I'm willing to offer $950000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $950000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This still gives us both a good margin, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1050000.  Would you be open to $1000000? That price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
