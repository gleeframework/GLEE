"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate and still get a good price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay at least close to my starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I will counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a good price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $140, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it would be nice to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
