"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think $1000000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to meet you at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
