Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, as it allows both of us to benefit significantly."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what I value the product at. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of losing out on a substantial portion of the potential profit.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which is a good sign he's willing to negotiate. I still believe the product is worth more, so I'll hold out for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move things along, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle on $1,090,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort towards reaching an agreement. My counteroffer would be $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and is steadily increasing his offer. Accepting $1,080,000 provides a substantial profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of dragging negotiations further, potentially losing him altogether."
