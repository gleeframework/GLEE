Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below what you value the product for.  While it's tempting to accept a million-dollar offer, you have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects my best judgement of its true worth and allows us both to benefit."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,150,000, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,087,500. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which is a good sign. You're still in a good position to negotiate further and close the gap towards your desired price point.  Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure it feels like a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,075,000, and we can discuss additional concessions on the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob is getting closer to your minimum price, but his mention of ""additional concessions"" raises a red flag. It's worth seeing if you can secure a better financial deal before considering concessions that might diminish the overall value you gain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is undeniable.  I'm willing to hold firm at $1,100,000.  I'm confident that once you see the returns, you'll agree it was a wise investment.  Let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

At this stage, it's strategic to hold your ground. You've compromised, and now it's about emphasizing the product's value and conveying a sense of finality to encourage Bob to meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,050,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional concessions to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

This is a strategic decision point.  Here's why selling to John is the best move:

* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** Bob has presented this as his ""final offer"" twice now, and it's significantly below your target. The additional concessions might not bridge the $50,000 gap to your minimum.
* **Concessions are risky:** You don't know what concessions Bob has in mind. They could negatively impact your profit or even create future complications.
* **Time is valuable:** You've spent considerable time negotiating with Bob. Accepting John's offer gives you a guaranteed $1,000,000 and allows you to move on to other potential deals. 

While there's a chance Bob could come back with a better offer, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a less favorable outcome is too high at this point."
