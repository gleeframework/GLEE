"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given the product's potential, I'm prepared to offer $900000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to make this deal work.  This price reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
