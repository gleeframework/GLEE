"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  Given the product's potential, I'm prepared to offer $900000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
