**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget.  You should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and you can always buy from John if you can't reach a satisfactory agreement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to make this deal work.  This price reflects a fair compromise and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
