"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I do see the value in your product, $750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $700,000. This would allow us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground!",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise that benefits both of us.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $725,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $710,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices. Let's close this deal. ",710000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $720,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",720000.0,Alice,5,
