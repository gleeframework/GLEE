Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or risk tolerance.
* If I learn more about Bob's personality and approach to deals, I might adjust my offer accordingly."
