"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'll be prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary, but I want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will encourage him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $13,000 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John.  There's always the risk that Bob will reject my counteroffers in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
