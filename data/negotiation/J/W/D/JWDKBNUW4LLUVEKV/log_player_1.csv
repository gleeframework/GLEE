Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit.  I'm confident that Bob, who values the product at $1,000,000, will likely be willing to negotiate to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to secure a sale,  $950,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify further negotiation. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who will pay the full $1,000,000.  I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob and the possibility of a lower price."
