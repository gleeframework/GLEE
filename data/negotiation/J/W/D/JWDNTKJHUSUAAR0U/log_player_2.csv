"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's below the value you've placed on it.  Let me know if you're interested, but please be aware that if you decline, I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by mentioning another buyer to pressure you. However, you have a better alternative with John who is offering the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $100,000."
