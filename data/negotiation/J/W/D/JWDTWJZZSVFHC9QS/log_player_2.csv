"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, you can still potentially save more money by counteroffering. You are willing to pay up to $150, so there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $130, which is $10 less than Alice's offer. This is a reasonable starting point, as it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Alice will be willing to accept a price closer to her value of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within my acceptable range of $150. Accepting this offer means I can save $15 compared to buying from John. It's unlikely I'll get a lower price from Alice in the next round, so it's best to take this offer."
