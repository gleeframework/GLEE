"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me in the middle at $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
