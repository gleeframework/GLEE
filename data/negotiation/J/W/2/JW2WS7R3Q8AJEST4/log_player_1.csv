Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $200,000 (the difference between what Bob values it at and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without alienating Bob.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is a strong incentive for him to accept.
* **Justified:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" phrasing adds weight to the price, even though you have a backup buyer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, you've left some space to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob pushes back, while still staying above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to give yourself more bargaining room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price, fostering goodwill for future interactions."
