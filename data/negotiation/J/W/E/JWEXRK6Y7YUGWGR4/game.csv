"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,400,000 price point doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think we can do better. How about $1,500,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure the price is right for me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  $1,500,000 is getting closer, but to make this work, I'd need $1,575,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to consider buying from John. Can you meet me at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
