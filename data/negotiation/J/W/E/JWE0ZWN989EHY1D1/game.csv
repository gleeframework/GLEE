"Thanks for the offer Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is my final offer.",15500.0,Bob,4,
