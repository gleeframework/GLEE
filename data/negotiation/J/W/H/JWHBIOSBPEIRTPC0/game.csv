"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $8800?  That's still a fair price and it would make this a much better deal for me.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I can do $9200, which is a bit more than your offer but still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9200 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? It's a fair price for both of us and would make this a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I can do $9350, which is a bit higher than your offer but still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you.",9350.0,Alice,5,
