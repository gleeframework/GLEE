Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm aware I have a backup offer from John at $100, but aiming higher initially gives me more bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, I'm still aiming higher. I know my minimum is $100, and he values the product at $120. There's room for a counteroffer that gets me closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is too low for me. How about we meet halfway at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting ""meeting halfway,"" I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Targeting Value:**  $110 is a strong price point â€“ it's above my minimum, significantly below Bob's perceived value, and a fair compromise from both our initial offers. 
* **Maintaining Position:** I'm avoiding large concessions and keeping the negotiation moving towards a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer.
* **Profitable Deal:** $108 is a solid profit, significantly above my minimum of $100 and close to my desired outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to accept John's offer of $100. Accepting now secures a good deal."
