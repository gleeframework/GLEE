"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm really interested in your product, though.  Would you be willing to come down to $15000? ",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth more than that to you.  How about we split the difference at $17500? ",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $17500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $16000. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Bob,4,
