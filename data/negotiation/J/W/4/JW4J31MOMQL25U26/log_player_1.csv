Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $11,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500.
