"Alice's offer:

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $80 is quite a bit below its value. Could you do $110?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $95. My final offer is $105. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105.  While the product might be worth a little more to you than $100, it's better to secure the guaranteed deal with John than risk Alice sticking to her final offer."
