,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $110 is still a little high for my budget. How about $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $90. I'm willing to make another small concession to $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and call it $97.50?",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $107.50. That way, I can still make a bit of a profit, and you'll get a good deal. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,7,
