"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,200. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",9200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8,750. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and offer $8,900.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,050. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,050 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $8,950. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal now.",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $9,025. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",9025.0,Alice,9,
