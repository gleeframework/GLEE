Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a product that I believe holds immense value for you.  Knowing it's worth $1,000,000 to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This offer reflects the significant value it holds, and while I have another interested buyer, I believe you would benefit most from its acquisition."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position. This allows you to aim high with Bob.
* **Value-Based Pricing:** Bob is aware of the product's worth to him. By emphasizing its value and positioning the price slightly higher, you're testing his willingness to pay a premium for something he knows is beneficial.
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer subtly creates a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price outweighs the risk of settling for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
