"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially setting the price at $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget, I'm unable to meet at $1,025,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
