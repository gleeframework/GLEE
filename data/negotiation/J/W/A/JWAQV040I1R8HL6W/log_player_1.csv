I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $13,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's above my minimum and below Bob's perceived value. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and slightly better than selling to John. I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
