"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,800,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident that both of us will be happy with this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
