"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $17,000. I believe this is a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a little high. Would you be willing to go down to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer for now. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're close! How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",15000.0,Bob,6,
