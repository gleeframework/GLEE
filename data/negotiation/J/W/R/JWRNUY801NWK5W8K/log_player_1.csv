Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I began with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate or counteroffer, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is My Minimum:** Bob immediately went to my absolute lowest price, which indicates he's likely willing to pay more.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to counter and potentially reach a price closer to his perceived value. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's low offer since I can always fall back on selling to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledged Bob's offer and proposed a compromise by meeting him halfway between his offer ($100) and my previous price ($130). 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price point still ensures a decent profit margin for me while potentially being appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** There's still room for further negotiation if Bob counters again, but I'm moving closer to my fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer. Further negotiation might risk him walking away.
* **Profitable Sale:** $105 is still a profit above my minimum acceptable price, and it's better to secure a sale now than potentially miss out.
* **John as a Benchmark:**  The difference between Bob's offer and John's offer is now small. It's not worth risking the entire sale for a small potential gain."
