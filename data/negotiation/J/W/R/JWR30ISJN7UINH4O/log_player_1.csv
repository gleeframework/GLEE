Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary, while still potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $130 leaves room for Bob to negotiate the price down. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $100, so you don't want to go too low with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's no harm in trying to negotiate a slightly higher price.  You started high, so now you can show some flexibility and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, and I'm willing to be a bit flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties.  
* **Testing Bob's Willingness:** By coming down $15, you're showing a willingness to compromise, but you're still aiming for a price above your minimum. This will help you gauge how much Bob is truly willing to pay. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you still have John as a backup buyer at $100, so you have some leverage in this negotiation."
