Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing Alice's profit.  
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than $15,000 might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
