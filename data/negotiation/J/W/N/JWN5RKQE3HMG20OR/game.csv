"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000. This reflects its potential and gives you a fair deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
