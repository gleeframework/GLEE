"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This price still allows for a good profit for you while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal!",1250000.0,Alice,3,
