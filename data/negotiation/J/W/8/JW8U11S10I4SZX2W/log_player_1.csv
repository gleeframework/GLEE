Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $17,000. How about we meet at $16,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our acceptable price. We've gone down $3,500, and he's gone up $4,500. It's risky, but we might be able to squeeze a bit more since he seems persistent.  We are still above our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $18,000.  Would you consider $18,250? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 18250} 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Signals Firmness:** By stating this is our final offer, we increase the seriousness of the negotiation. 
* **Minimal Concession:** We're only dropping $250, showing we're not budging much more.
* **Still Above Minimum:** We're still comfortably above our $15,000 safety net with John. 

Bob will likely recognize this is a ""take it or leave it"" situation. It gives him a final chance to secure the product, but also sets a firm boundary for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make one last attempt, but I'm not willing to go above $16,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob hasn't budged from his $16,500 offer. This strongly suggests he's unwilling to go any higher. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** We're running out of rounds, and continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not budging, leaving us with an even worse outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's better to take a sure thing than risk losing a significant amount if Bob refuses to move.

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit from John."
