Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth $100 to you, and while I'd be happy to sell it for that amount, I'm open to reasonable offers. What would you be willing to pay for it?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $100, giving us a strong starting point.
* **Aiming High, Staying Realistic:** Starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($90) increases the chances of a quick sale at a high profit margin. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility, suggesting I might be willing to go slightly lower while still anchoring the negotiation close to my desired price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, ensuring I don't lose out. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while maintaining a good chance of selling to Bob."
