"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this excellent product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at a lower price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my initial ask and demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a number that works for you.  However,  $1,250,000 significantly undervalues the product. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,300,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is my best effort to meet you in the middle, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close, but this deal only makes sense if it works for both of us. You've stated your position clearly. I'm proposing $1,262,500.  This splits the difference and represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair deal, given the value you'll receive.  ",1262500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000 is too high, so I'll try $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
