Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at a lower price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,225,000 is too high, so I'll try $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

At this point, Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000. Continuing the negotiation with Bob has a higher risk with no guarantee of a better outcome.  Selling to John is the most logical decision at this point."
