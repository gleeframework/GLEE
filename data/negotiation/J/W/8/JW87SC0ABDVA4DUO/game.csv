"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of starting at $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of your product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $825,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I believe this offer is reasonable and a good starting point for a final agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise a bit more. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
