Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $145 is above Bob's perceived value ($120) but potentially attractive enough to entice him. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** While you don't explicitly mention John to Bob, knowing you have another buyer gives you a stronger position in the negotiation."
