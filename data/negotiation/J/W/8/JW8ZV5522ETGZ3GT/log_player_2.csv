"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?

While $110 is closer to your target, it's still over your budget.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
