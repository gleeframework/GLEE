"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in buying it if we can find a price closer to $8000. Would you be open to negotiating further?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's split the difference.  How about $10000? It's a fair price that gives you a good deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable return.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping to stay closer to my budget of $8000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
