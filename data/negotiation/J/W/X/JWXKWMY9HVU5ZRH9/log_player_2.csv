"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000 for this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's not worth accepting this offer.  A counteroffer is the best strategy to see if Alice is willing to negotiate closer to your price range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,700,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. It's worth rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with her.  It's time to go with my backup option and buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget."
