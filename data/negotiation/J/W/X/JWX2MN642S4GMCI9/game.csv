"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than where I'm comfortable right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
