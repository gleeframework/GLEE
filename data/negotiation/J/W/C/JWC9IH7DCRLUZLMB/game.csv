"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more in the range of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? That's the highest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work.  However,  $12,500 is cutting it very close to my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. That's the best I can do.",12750.0,Bob,6,
