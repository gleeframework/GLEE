"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is far above Bob's budget.  He should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

Bob should start by offering his absolute maximum price. This will establish a clear boundary and hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

Bob should continue to inch closer to his maximum, but still leave room for negotiation. This offer shows his willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should keep negotiating. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to his budget, he should continue trying to get a better price. There's still room to haggle, and he might be able to secure a deal closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

Bob should try to meet Alice halfway by offering a price that is closer to her offer but still within his budget.  This shows that he is willing to compromise and could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is close to Bob's budget, he should continue to negotiate. He has already rejected offers much higher than this, so showing flexibility and continuing to negotiate is crucial. He might be able to get a price closer to his target, especially since only a few rounds remain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

Bob should make a final attempt to close the deal at a price just above his budget.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer might be enough to secure a deal before he has to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Only one round remains. Bob has already rejected offers close to this price, and Alice has shown a reluctance to budge. It is highly likely that Alice will not accept a counteroffer, and there is a high risk of failing to secure the product.  

Given the limited time and the uncertainty of a successful negotiation, Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000 to guarantee he gets the product within his budget."
