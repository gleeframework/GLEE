"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $160 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $160. I was thinking more along the lines of $145. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $145 is closer, but still a bit low for me. I'm willing to drop to $155. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not willing to pay $155. I'm thinking more along the lines of $152. That's as high as I'm willing to go.",152.0,Bob,6,
