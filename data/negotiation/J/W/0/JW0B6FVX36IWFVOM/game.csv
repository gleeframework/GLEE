"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to continue negotiating with you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $825,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $790,000 is getting very close to what I'm looking for. If you could go just a little higher to $800,000, I'd be happy to finalize the deal with you. This would be a great outcome for both of us. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,7,
