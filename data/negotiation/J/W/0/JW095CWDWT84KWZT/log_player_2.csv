"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $15 difference is a decent starting point, but still leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $132? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can likely still get it lower.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $132 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $128.50?  That way, we both save a little."", ""product_price"": 128.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a compromise that is still within his budget, while being a more attractive offer to Alice compared to the previous round. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal."
