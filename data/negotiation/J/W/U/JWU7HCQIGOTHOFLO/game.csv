,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $8,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value it will bring to you.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has great capabilities, but I still think $19,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $12,000 this time. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
