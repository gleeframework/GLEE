Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for the product.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but $8,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a very fair offer considering the value it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has great capabilities, but I still think $19,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $12,000 this time. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving towards a more reasonable price, the negotiations are progressing slowly.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly higher than $12,000. Accepting John's offer of $15,000 ensures I get a fair price without the risk of further haggling and potentially losing a guaranteed sale."
