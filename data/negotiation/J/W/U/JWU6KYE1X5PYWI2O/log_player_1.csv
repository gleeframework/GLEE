Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be realistic. Since you have a fallback option, you can be a bit bolder. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,150,000 gives you bargaining room while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly emphasize the product's worth.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fair deal"" and ""significant benefits,"" you provide a reason for the price without directly revealing your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Bob might try to negotiate you down. Be prepared to stand your ground or make small concessions, but never go below your $1,000,000 safety net."
