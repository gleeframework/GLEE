"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of great value to your business. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that reflects its potential. Are you interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum price. Since you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to buying from Alice. By rejecting the offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or if she's unwilling to budge, you can still buy the product from John."
