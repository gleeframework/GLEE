"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to find a price that works better for both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:**  While Bob's ideal price was $10,500, Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still a good deal. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and allows Bob to save money. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk that she might not accept a further counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  $11,250 represents a compromise between Bob's initial counteroffer and Alice's initial offer, showing that both parties are willing to negotiate."
