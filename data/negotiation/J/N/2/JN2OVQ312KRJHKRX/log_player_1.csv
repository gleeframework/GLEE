{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  While it's less than I'd like to get from Bob, it's still a significant profit, and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept my final counteroffer.  I've reached the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
