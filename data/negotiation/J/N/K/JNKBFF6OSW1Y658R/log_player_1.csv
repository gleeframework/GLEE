"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that much right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $85. This is still above my minimum value of $80 but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to get. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $82. I'm  getting closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum."
