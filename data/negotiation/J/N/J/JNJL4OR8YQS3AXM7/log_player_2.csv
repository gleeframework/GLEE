"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, so rejecting the offer gives more opportunity to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $200,000 reduction from her initial offer is a substantial move, but still within a range that feels reasonable. I want to see if she's willing to come down to a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows me to continue pushing for a lower price.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as there's still a significant difference between his price and my ideal target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm willing to compromise. The $100,000 increase from my previous offer demonstrates that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still striving for a price closer to my goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her offers are still above my ideal target. By rejecting her offer, I can continue to push for a lower price.  I'm still confident that I can reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds.  Buying from John is still a last resort if I can't secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,075,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again to $1,075,000. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate while still trying to stay within my desired price range. Alice has been receptive to my counteroffers so far, and I believe this compromise will lead to a successful deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my desired price range and is a significant improvement from her initial offer. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price. It's also worth considering that John's price of $1,500,000 is still much higher.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and within the timeframe of the negotiation."
