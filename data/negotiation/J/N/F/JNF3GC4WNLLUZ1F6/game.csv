"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great price, and I think you'll love the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you exactly at the midpoint. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, but that's as close as I can get. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",10200.0,Alice,9,
