"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and creates the perception that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Gauge Reaction:** This first offer is designed to assess Bob's interest level and give me information about his negotiation style. His response will help determine my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is already above his perceived value of $8,000. This indicates he's willing to pay a premium, and there's likely room for negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** While accepting Bob's offer would secure a profit, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000. It's strategically better to continue negotiating with Bob for now.
* **Early in Negotiation:**  We're only in Round 2, and I have plenty of time to try and get closer to my desired price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand the value this product brings, and I've tried to price it fairly.  While I can't go as low as $9,500, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer ($1,500 reduction), demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** By staying above Bob's offer, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price point.
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a brief justification for the price, emphasizing the product's value and my efforts to be fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is now more profitable than John's standing offer of $10,000.
* **Strong Position:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest in the product. 
* **Time Consideration:** While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a good profit."
