{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price of $1,200,000. This is a truly exceptional product with significant potential. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial offer:**  I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000. It gives me room to negotiate and also suggests the value of the product. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the unique value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Strategy:**  This approach aims to quickly assess Bob's seriousness and potentially push him to make a counteroffer. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my next offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, it's important to remember that I'm aiming to maximize profit. Bob's initial counteroffer is exactly my minimum, so accepting it would leave no room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm confident the product's value justifies a slightly higher price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the unique benefits of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's perspective but emphasize the product's value and the benefits of a higher price. I aim to create a sense of urgency and make him see the value of finding a middle ground.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer allows me to test Bob's commitment and see if he's willing to move closer to my desired price point. It also signals my willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly closer to my desired price point than my minimum.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing him entirely and having to settle for John's offer at $800,000 is too high. Accepting his offer secures a profit of $100,000, which is a good outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
