Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's try to close this deal. How about $990,000? This is a final offer from my side.  If you're serious about this purchase, I believe it's a fair price for both of us.

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $990,000, a substantial discount from John's price of $1,500,000 and well below your maximum budget.
* **Alice's Firm Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice walking away or you running out of rounds. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal entirely."
