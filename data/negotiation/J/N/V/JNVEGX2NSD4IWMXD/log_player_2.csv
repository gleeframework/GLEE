"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $80? "", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's $100 limit.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a little over budget at $110.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still over budget at $105. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further before resorting to John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $105 is still a bit over what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $102.50. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still slightly above Bob's limit.  It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for the guaranteed price of $100.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to further price reductions, but there's no guarantee that she will come down enough before the negotiation window closes.  It's a better strategy to secure the product at the known lower price from John."
