Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you get a great price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going in at $100 (Bob's max) might seem too aggressive and could make him more likely to reject the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting your offer."
