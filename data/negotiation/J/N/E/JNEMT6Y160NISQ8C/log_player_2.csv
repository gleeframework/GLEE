"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal value of $10,000. This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal value, it's still higher than he'd like to pay.  Bob is determined to get the best possible price and sees room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and try to lower the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's try $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price. He's showing flexibility by offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, but he's still pushing to get closer to his ideal value. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product while staying within his budget."
