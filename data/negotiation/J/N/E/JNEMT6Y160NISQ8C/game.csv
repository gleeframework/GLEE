"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,000 is still slightly above my budget.  Let's try $12,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
