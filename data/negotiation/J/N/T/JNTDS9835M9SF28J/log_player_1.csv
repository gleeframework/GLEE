{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I'll be happy to sell.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.  
* I'll also be keeping John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm a bit tight on budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also below my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. While his offer is low, he expressed interest in the product.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.  I need to be careful not to lose Bob completely, but I also don't want to sell for significantly less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit below what I can accept right now, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating that $11,000 is a good deal for Bob and that it allows me to make a reasonable profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm suggesting a ""happy middle ground"" to imply that I'm open to further discussion and potential adjustments.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll sell to him for $11,000.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer carefully. I'm starting to feel a little more pressure since my last offer was lower than my desired price. However, I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer! I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit stretched on my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved up from $9,000 to $9,500, his offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a Higher Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I know I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which gives me more leverage during negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'll aim for something closer to $11,000, but I'll also be prepared to make a slight concession if necessary. My goal is to get as close to my minimum as possible without losing Bob entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I see you're still keen on the product, and I appreciate that! While $9,500 is still a bit below what I can do, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's aim for a final agreement,  how does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final concession to $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this is the final step in the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly, emphasizing my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Significant Concession:** I'm framing my offer as a ""significant concession"" to highlight my flexibility and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Finality:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm aiming for a final agreement to put pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll sell to him for $10,500.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to make a tough decision.  $10,500 is close to my minimum, so I'm unlikely to lower my price further.  I'll carefully consider if I want to risk continuing the negotiation or simply move on to John and sell for $15,000."
