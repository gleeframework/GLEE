"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $120.  It's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $120 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $130. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $120. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
