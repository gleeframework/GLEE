"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($15,000). This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, but still trying to get a price closer to my minimum value. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  While $14,500 is close to my minimum, I believe there's room for Bob to move up a bit further.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm offering my minimum price.  If Bob doesn't accept this, I'm ready to sell to John and guarantee my desired value."
