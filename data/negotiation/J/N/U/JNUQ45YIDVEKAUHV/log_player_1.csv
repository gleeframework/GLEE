Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's also lower than what I would get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is more than the product is worth to him, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this will be enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in more back and forth, potentially leading to a deal that is even lower than $9,000.  By accepting now, I'm securing a deal that is reasonably profitable and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
