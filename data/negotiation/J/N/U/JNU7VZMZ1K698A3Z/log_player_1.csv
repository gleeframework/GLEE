""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is significantly higher than I had in mind. I'm prepared to offer $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects a more realistic valuation while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $700,000 if you're willing to work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is increasing, but it's still far below my minimum. I'll continue negotiating, but I need to see more significant movement from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to continue negotiations. However, to reach an agreement that works for both of us, I need to see a more substantial increase. I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go any higher. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap between $800,000 and my $1,500,000 minimum. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
