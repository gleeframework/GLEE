Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer for you before I explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Urgency and Alternatives:** Mentioning other options (John) subtly creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make the price feel more justified. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.  If he's more easygoing, this offer might be readily accepted.
* **Information Advantage:** You know John's offer, but Bob doesn't. Use this to your advantage, but be careful not to appear too pushy."
