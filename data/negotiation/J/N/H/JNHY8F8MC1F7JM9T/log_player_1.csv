Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum price of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still reflects the product's value, while giving you a substantial discount.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$775,000 is still too low. I'll counter offer again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. Let's meet at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I think $800,000 is a fair and final offer. It reflects a price that works well for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
