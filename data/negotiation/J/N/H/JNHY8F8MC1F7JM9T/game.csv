"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still reflects the product's value, while giving you a substantial discount.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still below my minimum. Let's meet at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I think $800,000 is a fair and final offer. It reflects a price that works well for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
