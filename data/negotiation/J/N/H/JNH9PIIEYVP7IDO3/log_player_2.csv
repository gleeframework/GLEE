"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. If you're interested, let me know. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. However, I have another buyer lined up at this price, so I can't hold the offer open indefinitely. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly what the product is worth to you. You have no incentive to accept her offer because you can buy the same product from John for the same price. By choosing to buy from John, you don't lose any money and still achieve your goal of acquiring the product."
