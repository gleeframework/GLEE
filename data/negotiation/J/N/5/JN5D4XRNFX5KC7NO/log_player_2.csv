"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, meaning there's no room for savings. Since you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the better choice. This allows for potential negotiation and a lower purchase price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is a compromise that still brings a significant profit for me, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my desired price range.  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, I can continue to explore potential savings."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offer and brings us closer to my target price of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or stick to her current price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a lower price than John's, and it's a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to Alice."
