"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking for $90.  It's a good idea to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a better price. You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really like the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're starting with a lower price, but it's still a fair starting point since you're willing to pay up to $80. You're showing Alice you're serious about buying the product while also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $82.50?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $82.50 is closer to your maximum, you still have room to negotiate.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and you should continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum. If you're interested in selling at that price, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're now at your maximum price, so you're putting the ball in Alice's court. The message is firm but not overly aggressive, and you're reminding Alice that you have alternatives."
