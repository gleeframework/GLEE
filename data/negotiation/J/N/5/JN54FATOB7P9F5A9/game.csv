"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really like the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $82.50?  Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my maximum. If you're interested in selling at that price, let me know.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
