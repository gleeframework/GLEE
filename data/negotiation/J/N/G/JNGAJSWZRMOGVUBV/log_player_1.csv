Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,120,000. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1,110,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,110,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away."
