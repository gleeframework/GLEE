"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to start with a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, there's potential to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant investment. I believe this is a fair price, considering our respective valuations."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $750,000 is a good starting point, I still believe my product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still aiming for a lower number.  Since there are more rounds available, it's worth continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer and potential further price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $850,000, but I'm willing to come up slightly. I'd like to offer $800,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and is still within a reasonable range for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is only $25,000 above my previous counteroffer of $800,000.  At this point, it's likely we're getting close to the final price. Accepting the offer saves further negotiation time and secures the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's offer."
