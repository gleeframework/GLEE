Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $900,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can push her down further before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to make a final offer to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her final offer of $925,000 is still outside of your budget. It's getting very close to your limit, but it's not worth risking going over for the sake of a small potential saving.  You've already negotiated a significant amount and it's unlikely Alice will budge further. Therefore, it's best to secure the product from John at $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget and avoid any potential further negotiation frustrations."
