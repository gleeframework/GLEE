"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping to land closer to $800,000, which is my budget for this type of product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $800,000. Would you consider a final price of $875,000?  This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and is the highest I can go.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000.
