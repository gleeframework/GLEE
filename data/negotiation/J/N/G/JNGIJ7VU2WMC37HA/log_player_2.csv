It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** $12,400 is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away.
* **Limited Rounds:**  You only have a few rounds left, and finding a better deal elsewhere isn't guaranteed."
