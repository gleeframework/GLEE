"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $12,800. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the value of the product to you.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $12,900. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12900.0,Alice,5,
