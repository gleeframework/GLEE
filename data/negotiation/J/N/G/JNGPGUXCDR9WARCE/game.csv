"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $10,500? This would allow me to make a fair profit while also leaving room for you to get a great deal. Let's find a way to make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'd be happy to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
