{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's definitely worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts by making the most aggressive counteroffer possible, given his budget. He knows Alice is motivated to sell, and this initial offer clearly sets the boundaries of his willingness to pay.  This strategy aims to force Alice to make concessions quickly."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still outside of Bob's comfort zone. While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and reach a price closer to his target."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $16,500 is tempting, it's still higher than what Bob is comfortable with. It's worth continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds. Even if he ends up buying from John, it's good practice to try and squeeze the best deal possible from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not budging much from her price point, and the negotiations are becoming increasingly time-consuming. While $16,900 is a decent price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. With only three rounds left, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring he gets the best deal within his budget."
