Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum price point, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
