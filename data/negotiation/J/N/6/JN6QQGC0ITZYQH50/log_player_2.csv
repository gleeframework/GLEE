"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference at $8,500? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of this product to you while also allowing me to make a profit. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down, but $8,500 is still closer to her desired price than ours. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement by suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer and the price offered by John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a fair deal for my investment. Let's close this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but we still have room to negotiate. A difference of $500 is significant enough to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I can appreciate the need for a fair deal on both sides. Would you be willing to meet at $7,200?  That would make it easier for me to finalize the purchase."",
""product_price"": 7200
}
``` 

We're proposing a smaller concession in this round to signal that we're nearing our desired price point.  The goal is to entice Alice to agree without pushing the negotiation too far and risking an impasse."
