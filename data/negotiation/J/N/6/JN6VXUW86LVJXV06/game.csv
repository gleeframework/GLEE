"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in your product but would need to see a lower price. I'd be willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value this product, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  To be honest, $1150000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1175000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
