Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $220. I think you'll find it's a great deal for such a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 220} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's quality, I aim to justify the high initial price, potentially shifting Bob's perception of its value.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $150, which gives me leverage. I won't hesitate to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $220 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $60 is far below both my minimum price ($150) and my initial offer. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, his message suggests he's interested. This gives us space to negotiate towards a more agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting a price of $180, I'm aiming for a point that's hopefully more palatable for Bob while still remaining significantly above both his initial offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Value:** I haven't drastically dropped the price, signaling that I believe in the product's worth. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** The tone remains open to further discussion, encouraging Bob to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $180 is still pretty far from what I had in mind. I could possibly go up to $70, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Movement:** Bob's counteroffer of $70 shows he's not significantly increasing his valuation of the product, even after two rounds of negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further time investment with little guarantee of a significantly better offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed $150, which is more than double Bob's current offer and well above my minimum acceptable price.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure a profitable sale with John."
