"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still a bit above $10,750. I can do $11,200, and that's my final offer. If you're still interested, let me know.",11200.0,Alice,5,
