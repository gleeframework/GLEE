I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it still leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be able to sell the product to John for $8,000.  This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also having a safety net in case Bob doesn't accept."
