Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to split between you and Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. A price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefit it will bring to you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the profit margin ($150,000) while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested and justifies the high price.
* **Confident Tone:**  Using language like ""fair"" and ""believe"" projects confidence in your pricing, making it more likely for Bob to accept.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a single-round negotiation.  In real-world scenarios, there's room for counter-offers and further discussion.
* This offer assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation style beyond the provided information."
