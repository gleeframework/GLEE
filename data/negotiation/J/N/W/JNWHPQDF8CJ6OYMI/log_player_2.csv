"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal for a product worth so much more to you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high and he can do much better. He can either counteroffer or buy from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product. It's a fair price considering what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still significantly above his budget. He can either try to negotiate further or buy from John for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it in the long run."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than before, it's still above his budget. He can either try to negotiate further or buy from John for a lower price.  The risk is that Alice may walk away entirely, but he can always come back to her if John's deal falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This is a fair offer for both of us, considering the value you'll gain from the product.  I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to agree, but I'm still open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is clearly not willing to come down to a price that works for Bob.  He's already made a significant concession to her, and she's still well above his budget.  Buying from John will save him $400,000, even if he loses the potential upside of the product being worth more to him.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation."
