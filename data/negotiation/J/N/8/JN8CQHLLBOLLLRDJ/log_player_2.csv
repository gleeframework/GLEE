# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is too high, and you can get the same product from John for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $130 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
