"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob sees some value in it as well. We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still aim for a higher profit than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000.  This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully appealing enough for Bob to consider.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can push for a higher amount. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but higher than Bob's offer, to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly again to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it is a fair price considering Bob's previous offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
