Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $100 is still below the value Bob places on the product ($120), making a counteroffer likely.
* **Friendly and encouraging:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price point.  
* **No risk of losing value:** Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price above my minimum acceptable value of $80.
* **No guarantee of a better outcome:** While I could counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Bob would accept a higher price.  There's also the risk that the negotiation could drag on, and I might end up selling to John for the lower price."
