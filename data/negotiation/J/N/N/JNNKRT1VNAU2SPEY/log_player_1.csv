Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more aggressive initial offer to Bob."
