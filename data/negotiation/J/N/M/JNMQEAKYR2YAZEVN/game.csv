"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I can do $135, but that's as low as I can go.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can do $130. That's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you $130, Bob, and you're asking me to go back to $125? I'm not willing to do that. I'm willing to compromise again, so I can do $128. That's the best I can do.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. Would you be willing to consider a price of $126?",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've been flexible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $128. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but the price is non-negotiable. I can include a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total value you'll get is $148. That's the best I can do.",128.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the free accessory, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $126 and $128, which would be $127. Would you be willing to accept that price?",127.0,Bob,10,
