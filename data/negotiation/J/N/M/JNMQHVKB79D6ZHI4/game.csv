"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit outside my range. Would you consider $90? It's the highest I can go right now.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll be a happy customer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $105. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
