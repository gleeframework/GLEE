Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  I believe this is a fair deal considering what you could gain from it."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product at your minimum ($15,000) would guarantee Bob's rejection.  A price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) increases the chance of acceptance, but you risk leaving money on the table.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $13,500 sits comfortably between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It gives Bob a sense of getting a slight discount while still netting you a significant profit."
