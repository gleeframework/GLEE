"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
