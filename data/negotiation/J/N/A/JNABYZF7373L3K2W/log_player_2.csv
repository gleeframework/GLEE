"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could let it go for $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,275,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal. I'm still willing to pay more than John's price, but I want to see if I can get Alice down further."
