Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and John's offer. I should counter, but leave myself room to negotiate.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  To move this forward, I could let it go for $1,275,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,275,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough choice. Bob is firm at $1,200,000, and while it's a decent offer, I know I have John at $1,500,000. However, going back and forth might make Bob walk away. It's a risk to push further. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I could potentially squeeze more out of Bob, the certainty of John's offer is more appealing given the circumstances and Bob's firm stance."
