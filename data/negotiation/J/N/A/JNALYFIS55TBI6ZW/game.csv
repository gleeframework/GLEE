"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still not satisfied with the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,400. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope this revised offer meets you halfway.",10400.0,Alice,5,
