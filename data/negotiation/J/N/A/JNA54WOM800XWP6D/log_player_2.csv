"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a very fair price for this product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you see the value in this product. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85 if we can close the deal now.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85 and her current offer exceeds your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
