"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a premium price for this exceptional product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'd need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting closer to the price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm still looking to maximize the value of this exceptional product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
