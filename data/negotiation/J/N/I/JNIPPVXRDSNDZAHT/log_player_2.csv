You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum price. You still have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price from Alice. You also have the option to buy from John if the negotiations fall through."

```

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price of $80. While you have rounds left to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and the deal could drag on for a long time. It's better to avoid this risk and buy the product from John for $80, ensuring you get the best possible price and saving time."
