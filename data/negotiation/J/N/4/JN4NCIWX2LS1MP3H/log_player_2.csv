"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be interested in paying $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price below $9,000.  He has room to negotiate further, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $8750? That's a good midpoint between our last offers. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit far off. I'll meet you at $9250, which is my absolute minimum. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would still prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $9,250 is very close to Bob's ideal price range.  It's also better than the $10,000 price from John.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
