"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer gives me negotiating space in subsequent rounds. If Bob counters, I can gradually reduce the price while gauging his seriousness.

I'm aiming to secure a deal above my minimum, but I'm also aware of the $1,000,000 backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still below my target and leaves a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I believe there's room for negotiation. 

I'll counter in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident this product will deliver significant value to your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still a significant profit ($75,000) above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiating Stance:**  Bob has indicated this is his highest offer.  Continuing to push for more might lead to him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer introduces uncertainty. Accepting now secures a good deal."
