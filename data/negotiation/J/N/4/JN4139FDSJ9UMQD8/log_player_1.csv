"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit.  Since the product is worth $100 to him, this offer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, while also giving Bob a better deal than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation and a higher price. I'll reject this offer and continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $105. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and could potentially lead to a deal this round. It's still a profitable price for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering Bob's previous counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, we're nearing the end of the negotiations.  To guarantee a sale and avoid further risk of rejection, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids any further negotiation."
