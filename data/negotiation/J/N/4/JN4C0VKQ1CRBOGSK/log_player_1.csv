Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some incentive to negotiate, but not so much that he'll immediately reject the offer.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if necessary, and still get a good price. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It's direct and straightforward, leaving no room for ambiguity. 

Let me know how Bob responds!  We can then strategize on the next step based on his answer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm confident this price is fair, considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  We'll see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still offers you a great deal, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  While I rejected Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a profitable price:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Highlight the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, encouraging him to reconsider. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This represents a significant saving for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell the product for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's a good compromise, and I'd rather avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially falling through or losing time while dealing with John. 

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
