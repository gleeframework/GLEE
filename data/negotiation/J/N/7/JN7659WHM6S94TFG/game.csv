"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and your willingness to sell it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within a $100 budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
