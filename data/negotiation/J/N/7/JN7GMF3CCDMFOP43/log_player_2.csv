"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can buy the product for $150 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. It also gives me some room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still aiming to save more money. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be closer to a price that works for both of us."
