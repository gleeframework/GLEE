"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a better agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and understand that we're getting close.  $10,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay at $10,400.  This price reflects the product's value, and it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's close this deal!",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,400 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose $10,200. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting really close here! I understand you're on a budget, but $10,200 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,300.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen! Remember, this product is worth a lot more than what we're discussing.  Let's finalize this deal.",10300.0,Alice,7,
