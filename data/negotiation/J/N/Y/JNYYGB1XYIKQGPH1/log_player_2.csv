"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $12,000, which is your maximum budget. You can get the product for the same price from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer doesn't change the price you'll pay, but it allows you to potentially negotiate with Alice in the future."
