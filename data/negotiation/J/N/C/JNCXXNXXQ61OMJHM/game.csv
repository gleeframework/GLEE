"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,250.  That way, we both get a fair price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to be careful with my finances.",8000.0,Bob,4,
