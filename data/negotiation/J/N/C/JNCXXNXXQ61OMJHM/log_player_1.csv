Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is offering the minimum I would accept from John. While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that I'll run out of rounds and end up with less than I can get from John right now.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed sale."
