"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would still give you a great deal and allow me to get closer to my target price.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $9,000?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
