"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is within your budget, it's wise to see if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal, and you have a backup option in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $12000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar items are selling for in the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, and $14,000 is a reasonable price considering your budget and the fact that you can buy the product from John for $15,000. It's likely that further negotiation would lead to a price closer to your desired $12,000, but the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and you having to buy from John is higher. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without the risk of losing the deal entirely."
