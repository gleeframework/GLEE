"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do think the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $15,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,500 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
