Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be immensely beneficial to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its value to both of us.  I'm proposing $950,000. This is a significant discount from what I would accept from other buyers, but I see the potential for us to both benefit from this deal."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob at $950,000 still yields a substantial profit. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Starting with a strong offer slightly below my guaranteed price with John creates room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. The message emphasizes this is a ""take it or leave it"" deal.
* **Time Value:** Closing a deal quickly with Bob might be more advantageous than waiting for potential negotiations with other buyers. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
