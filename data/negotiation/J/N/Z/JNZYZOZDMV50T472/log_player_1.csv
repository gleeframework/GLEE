Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You confidently state the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 gain and you a $150,000 profit over your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of urgency, encouraging a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You could experiment with slightly different prices within the negotiation space to see how Bob responds."
