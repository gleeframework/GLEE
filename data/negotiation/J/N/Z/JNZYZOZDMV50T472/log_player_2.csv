"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you. This is a limited-time offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a significant markup from her valuation. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might prompt her to offer a lower price, closer to her $1,000,000 valuation. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $1,200,000, which is your maximum limit."
