"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, based on my budget and valuation of the product, I am unable to meet the price of $18000. Would it be possible to negotiate a lower price? Thank you.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $17500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $17000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go below $18000, as I believe the product's value is still higher. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $18250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",18250.0,Alice,5,
