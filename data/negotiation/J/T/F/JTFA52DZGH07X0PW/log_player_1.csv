"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to try to squeeze out a few more dollars in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable midpoint and agrees to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident Bob will see this as a fair compromise. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John, but I hope to avoid that."
