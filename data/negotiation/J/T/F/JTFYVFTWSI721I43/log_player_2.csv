"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $80 by both myself and you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit your needs. I am proposing to sell this product to you for $75, a special introductory price that I hope will make it accessible while still allowing me to fairly compensate for my investment and time. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $75 is a good deal. It allows you to acquire the product for less than your maximum budget while still being a fair price for Alice."
