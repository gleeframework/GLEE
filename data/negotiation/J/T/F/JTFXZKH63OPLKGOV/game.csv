"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your operations.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your desired profit margin and my own financial constraints.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value and my original asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a fair price given the value we both see in the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,360,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1360000.0,Alice,5,
