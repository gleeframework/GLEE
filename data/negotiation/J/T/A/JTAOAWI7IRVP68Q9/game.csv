"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can find a better balance. How about we aim for a price closer to $900,000? I think it's fair for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value this product brings. I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can reach a more equitable solution. How about we consider $1,050,000 as a compromise? This would allow me to invest more in the product while keeping my costs reasonable.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
