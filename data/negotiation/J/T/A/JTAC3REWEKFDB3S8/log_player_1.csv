**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, it's becoming increasingly clear he's unwilling to go much higher. Accepting at $1,850,000 secures a substantial profit, whereas continuing the negotiation carries the risk of him walking away entirely. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially lose out on a significant amount."
