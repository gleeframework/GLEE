{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $8,500 for the product? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation aggressively, offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.

```

```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm getting closer to your price point, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $9,000? I'm confident this price will make us both happy."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small concession, moving closer to Alice's offer, but still pushing for a lower price. He's trying to signal that he's serious about buying the product and wants to close the deal, but he's not willing to give in entirely. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving and potentially secure a quick agreement at a price close to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, but I still need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, but I need to get a bit more out of this deal. I'm now offering it to you for $9,375. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already rejected Alice's offer of $9,250 twice. There are only a few rounds left, and it's getting close to his maximum price point.  While $9,375 is a bit more than he wanted to pay, it's still a decent deal and saves him $625 compared to buying from John.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's likely that the price will not drop much further, and accepting the offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
