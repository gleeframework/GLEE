{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a substantial price point, but it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least at $1,050,000 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of this product and the potential benefit to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $1,025,000 is a decent compromise and a good deal considering John is willing to pay $1,000,000. It's important to secure the sale and avoid further negotiations that might lead to a lower offer or a lost deal."
