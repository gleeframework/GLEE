# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1100000. This is a substantial price point, but it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least at $1050000 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of this product and the potential benefit to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not willing to pay $1,050,000, as it's still a bit too high for my budget. I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
