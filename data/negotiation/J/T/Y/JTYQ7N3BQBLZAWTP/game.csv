"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1100000. This is a substantial price point, but it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least at $1050000 to make this work. This is a fair price considering the value of this product and the potential benefit to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1050000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
