Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product.

While getting some money from Bob would be ideal, he's too far off my bottom line. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
