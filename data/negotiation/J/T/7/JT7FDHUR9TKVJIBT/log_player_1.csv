"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.  This demonstrates my confidence in the product's worth while also indicating a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a significant margin above my minimum. This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and potentially lead to a quick agreement."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try to reach a mutually agreeable price.  However, I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but just a little. I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. I'm hoping he'll take this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good offer. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of the deal."
