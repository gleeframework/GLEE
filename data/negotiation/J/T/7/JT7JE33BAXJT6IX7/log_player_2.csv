Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Alice will go any lower."
