Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a good price.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear, concise message:** It avoids confusion and gets straight to the point. 

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested.  I can counteroffer with a price that is more favorable to me.
* **I don't want to settle for less:**  John is willing to pay my full value, so I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will counteroffer to Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I want to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($800,000).  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Stay above minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it is closer to what I believe is a fair market value.
* **Highlight mutual benefit:** I emphasize that the price still reflects the value of the product to Bob, making it a win-win situation.

**Next steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response. If he still refuses, I will consider either lowering my price slightly or accepting John's offer."
