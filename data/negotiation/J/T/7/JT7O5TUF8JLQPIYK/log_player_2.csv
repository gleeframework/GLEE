"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. I believe this product offers you a substantial return on your investment.  Would you consider $1,050,000? It splits the difference and represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to a price Bob is willing to pay, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price. It's a gamble, but it could potentially save Bob a significant amount of money."
