"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get the product for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer,  demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's ideal price is $10,000, Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even calling off the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving $1,000 compared to buying from John."
