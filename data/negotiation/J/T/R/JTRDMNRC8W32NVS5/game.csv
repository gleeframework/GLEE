,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $110 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle at $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
