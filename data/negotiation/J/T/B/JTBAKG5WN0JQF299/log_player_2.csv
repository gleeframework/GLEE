"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and she's asking for $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $11,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still too high. You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and she's only come down $1,500.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to offer $12,500, which is a significant move closer to your last offer. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This is the best I can do, considering the value I have in mind. I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than you're willing to pay.  While you could continue negotiating, it's looking like you might be going back and forth for a while.  Since you have the option of buying from John for $12,000, it makes sense to take that option and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
