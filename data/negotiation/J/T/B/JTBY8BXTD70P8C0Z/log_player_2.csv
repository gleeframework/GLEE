"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $9,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice is starting high. There's room to negotiate a better price.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer gives me more room to negotiate. I'm aiming to get as close to Alice's value of $8,000 as possible without exceeding my own budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to her actual value, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth countering one more time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $8,200?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm getting closer to my maximum budget but leaving a little wiggle room in case Alice counters. This offer is a good compromise, saving me a decent amount compared to both Alice's previous offers and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think $8,200 is getting closer to the sweet spot, but I'd like to get a bit more. How about we meet at $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge much from $8,800. Accepting this offer saves me $1,200 compared to John's price, which is a significant saving. It's time to close the deal."
