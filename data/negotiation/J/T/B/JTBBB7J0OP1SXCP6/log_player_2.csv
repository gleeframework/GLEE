"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $140, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit more than I was hoping for.  How about $130?  It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I think the product is worth more than 130. How about we meet in the middle at 135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still aiming for a price lower than $135. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $132.  I'm really interested in the product, and this price would work great for my budget."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, Bob. How about we meet at 134? It's a good balance between what I need and what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $134. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $134
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is willing to go down to $134, which is within your budget and a good deal for both of you.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely you won't get a better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
