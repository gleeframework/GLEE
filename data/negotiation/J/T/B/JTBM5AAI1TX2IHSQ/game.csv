"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my business.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers unique value, and I believe a price of $1,950,000 reflects its worth more accurately. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
