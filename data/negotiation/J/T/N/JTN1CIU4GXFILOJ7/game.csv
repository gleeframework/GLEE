"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
