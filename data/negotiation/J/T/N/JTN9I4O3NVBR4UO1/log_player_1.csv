I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already spent a few rounds negotiating.  At this point, it's not worth risking a further rejection and potentially losing out on any profit. I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
