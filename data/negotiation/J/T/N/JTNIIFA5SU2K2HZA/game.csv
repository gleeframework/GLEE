"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,800,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,700,000. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,700,000 and $1,600,000, which is $1,650,000. Let's see if we can shake on it.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,625,000, which is a fair middle ground. Let's make this happen.",1625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,625,000, but I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a personalized consultation with the product's creator. How about we call it $1,675,000 for the whole package?",1675000.0,Alice,7,
