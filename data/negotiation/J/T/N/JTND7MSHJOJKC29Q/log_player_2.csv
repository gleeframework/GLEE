"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe is truly invaluable. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I understand its worth to you might be $1000000. After careful consideration, I am extending an offer to you to purchase this product at a price that reflects its true value while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $950000. This offer allows me to earn a substantial return on my investment, while you receive a product that far exceeds its cost. I look forward to discussing the details further and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
* **Your Value:** $1,000,000
* **John's Price:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better deal, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether."
