"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the information about its value to you. However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $8000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal considering your maximum budget is $12,000. You're saving $3,000 compared to buying from John, and Alice is also willing to sell it for less than its value to her. Accepting this offer is the most financially sensible option."
