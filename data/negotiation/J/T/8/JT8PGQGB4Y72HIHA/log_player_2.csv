# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal for you. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially pushing the price back up is high. It's best to accept her offer and secure the product for a price slightly above your initial target."
