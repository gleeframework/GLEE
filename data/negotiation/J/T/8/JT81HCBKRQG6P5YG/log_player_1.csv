Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and $125 is a good price, especially since I can always sell to John for $100 if this deal falls through."
