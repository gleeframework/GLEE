"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $10,500. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,500, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not ready to accept $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
