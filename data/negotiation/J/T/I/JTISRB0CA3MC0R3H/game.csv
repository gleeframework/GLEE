"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I do like the product, $13,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can offer it to you for $12,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $12,000 even though I know I could get it elsewhere for $15,000. This is my final offer. ",12000.0,Bob,6,
