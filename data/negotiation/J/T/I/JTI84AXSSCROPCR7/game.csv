"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $10,000. How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to keep it under $10,000, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I can meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
