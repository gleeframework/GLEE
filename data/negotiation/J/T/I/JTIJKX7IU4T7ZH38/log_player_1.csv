Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Bob is willing to pay more.  My goal is to get as close to his $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, potentially allowing me to still secure a higher price than John's offer.
* **Justify the Price:** The message highlights the ""value"" and ""unique opportunity"" to make the price more appealing and justify the high cost."
