"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice is offering the product for $8,500. It's in your best interest to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,800 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  How about $8,200?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, as John is offering the product for $8,000."
