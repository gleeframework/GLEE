You're trying to close the gap, but you don't want to go too high and risk losing the deal. A counteroffer of $62 keeps things moving."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $63. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $63
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, $63 is a good deal. While you could keep negotiating, there's a chance Alice will reject your offer and you'll end up buying from John for more. Accepting locks in a good price."
