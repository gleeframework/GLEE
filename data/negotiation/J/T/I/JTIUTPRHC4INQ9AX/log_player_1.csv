Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept, highlighting the deal's value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open.  I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John for my minimum desired price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer and seeing if Bob is willing to compromise further.  Selling to John remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob stall or lead to an unacceptable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:** I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal to show I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial $1,200,000 offer to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlight mutual benefit:** I emphasize that my counteroffer allows for both of us to gain something, making it seem like a fair and reasonable solution. 
* **Open for further discussion:** I leave the door open for further negotiation by asking if we can reach an agreement. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is more acceptable to both of us. I'm still above Bob's offer, but I've shown flexibility and am prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'm also keeping John's $1,500,000 offer in mind as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the distance we've come in our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation.  I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer and seeing if Bob is willing to compromise further.  It's important to remember that selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the progress we've made. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,012,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show appreciation and progress:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and the progress we've made in the negotiation to maintain a positive tone.
* **Counter with a smaller compromise:** I'm coming down from my previous offer of $1,050,000 to $1,012,500, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Highlight fairness and compromise:** I emphasize that this price reflects the value of the product and represents a reasonable compromise, making it seem like a fair solution.
* **Urge for finality:** I suggest finalizing the deal to encourage Bob to accept and move forward.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and reaching a mutually agreeable price. I'm still above Bob's offer, but I've shown flexibility and am prepared to negotiate further if necessary. I'm also keeping John's offer as a backup option if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,012,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $987,500. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the product's value and our negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $987,500 is close to my desired price, it's still not reaching my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we're not making significant progress towards a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

Therefore, it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This ensures I reach my minimum desired price and avoids further time and effort spent on a potentially unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
