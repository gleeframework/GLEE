"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
