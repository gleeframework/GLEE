"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He has a safety net with John's offer of $800,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob opens the door to a counteroffer and potentially getting a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than John's offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also has a fallback option. This counteroffer sets a clear starting point for further negotiation and might incentivize Alice to consider lowering her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $800,000.  Accepting her offer means Bob gets the product at a good price, but also avoids the risk of further negotiation where he might end up paying more or even losing the deal altogether. It's a strategic choice to secure the purchase while minimizing the financial loss."
