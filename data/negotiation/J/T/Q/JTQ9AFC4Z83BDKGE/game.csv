"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point. However, $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value of the product to both parties, I propose a price of $9300 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still within a reasonable range considering its worth to us.",9300.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9300 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9100 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell it. Let's close the deal.",9100.0,Bob,4,
