"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. While $12,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
