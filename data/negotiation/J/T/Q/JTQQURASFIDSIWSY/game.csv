"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is certainly interesting to me, but the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best compromise at this point. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Could we agree on $1,050,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that this is your final offer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,065,000?  It seems like a fair compromise to get this deal done.",1065000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,080,000. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, but I need to stay firm on my minimum price. I'm willing to give you one more chance to meet me at $1,080,000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
