{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is gradually coming down in price, so you can increase your offer slightly, but still keep it within your budget. $10,000 is a good compromise, showing you're serious but still not giving up your ideal price. This could potentially get Alice to accept and secure the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above your desired budget, and you've only got three rounds left. You've been actively negotiating, but there's a risk that Alice will continue to lower her price too slowly, or that you might not be able to reach a suitable agreement in the remaining rounds.  It's better to be safe than sorry, and buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price."
