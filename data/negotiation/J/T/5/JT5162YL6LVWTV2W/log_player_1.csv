Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $19,000.  I know it's valuable and believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You won't sell for less than $15,000 because John guarantees that amount.
* **Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so we need to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for profit.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) gives you negotiating room.  Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land a price higher than your $15,000 minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message aims to subtly justify the high price by emphasizing the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a real-world scenario, you might adjust your approach based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
