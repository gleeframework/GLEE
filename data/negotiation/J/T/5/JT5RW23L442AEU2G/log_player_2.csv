# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle now.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $10,500.

Alice is holding firm above your maximum budget.  It's unlikely she'll go below $11,000, especially since she stated $11,500 is her final offer. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a better outcome for you."
