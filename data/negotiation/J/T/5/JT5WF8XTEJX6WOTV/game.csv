"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That seems like a fair price to me.",97.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $97, but I'm still open to negotiating. I can offer you the product for $102. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",102.0,Alice,5,
