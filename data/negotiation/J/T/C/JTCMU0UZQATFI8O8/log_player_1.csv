{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $115 is a good starting point, offering a decent profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Be reasonable:**  It's not too far off Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll consider it.
* **Open communication:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in a conversation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
