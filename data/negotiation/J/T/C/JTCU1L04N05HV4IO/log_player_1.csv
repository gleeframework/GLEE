"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, rather than focusing on my own needs. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  A $1 million offer allows for a potential compromise in future rounds. 

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below what I'm hoping for. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I have 8 rounds remaining, which gives me time to potentially push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,200,000, but I want to explore if I can get closer to that with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $900,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our continued discussion, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value the product brings to Bob, highlighting the potential for a good return on investment.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm positioning the offer as a win-win for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $950,000, I'm leaving room for potential negotiation in the upcoming rounds while still staying above Bob's current offer.  I'm aiming to  find a price point that is acceptable to Bob while still getting me closer to my desired selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer of $925,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit below what I'm hoping for.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 6 rounds left, which is still enough time to potentially secure a better deal.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price slightly higher than $925,000.  I'll aim to keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price point while staying aware of the value of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $937,500. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this mutually beneficial transaction. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($925,000). This shows my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Emphasis on Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us, emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting ""sealing the deal,"" encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that is closer to Bob's desired price, I'm hoping to increase the chances of reaching an agreement in this round.  However, I'm still keeping in mind John's offer as a potential backup option if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counteroffer at $930,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $930,000 is very close to my previous offer of $937,500.  It's a good deal considering we're halfway through the negotiation process.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob is increasing.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,200,000 is tempting, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and saves time.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer in this round minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely and still nets me a significant profit."
