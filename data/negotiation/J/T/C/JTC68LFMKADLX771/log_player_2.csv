"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that's sure to benefit you greatly.  I understand its worth to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's discuss a figure that's fair to both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. Alice knows the product is worth less to her ($800,000) than your maximum, so there's room for her to come down. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you have John as a backup option at $1,000,000."
