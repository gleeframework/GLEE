"Alice, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is limited.  I'm willing to offer $15000 for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go higher than $16000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go up to $16500.  This is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $17000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,7,
