I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can still get him to move a little more, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I know the product is worth."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are no longer significantly increasing. I've also already made multiple concessions. Rather than continue to haggle with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get the maximum value for my product and avoids any further potential loss of time and effort in the negotiation."
