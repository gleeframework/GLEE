"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I understand you're still looking for a bit more flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer we discussed.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11500, so I'd be willing to pay $11000. I think that's a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go back to the $11000 price, but I'm willing to meet you at $11500. I'm not going to go any higher than that, so if you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $11500, but I'm willing to meet you at $11000, as I mentioned before. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm starting to think about buying from John for $15000.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $11000, but I'm willing to meet you at $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're not interested, I'll be selling the product to John for $8000.",12000.0,Alice,9,
