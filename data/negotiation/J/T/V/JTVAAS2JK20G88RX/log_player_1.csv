Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of significant value. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $15,000, which is a decent amount above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive and Open:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much, keeping Bob curious.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while ensuring I start at a price that maximizes my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still High:** While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum of $10,000.  This means there's room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have John as a backup option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him closer to my desired price. I'm in a good negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm not going to accept Bob's offer right away, as I believe there's more room for negotiation. My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm lowering the price to $13,500, which is still above my minimum and is a reasonable compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Push for a Higher Price:**  While I'm coming down, I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain Momentum:**  By not rejecting Bob outright, I keep the negotiation going and prevent it from stalling.
* **Signal Willingness to Negotiate:**  My counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $13,500. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I keep rejecting, there's a risk that Bob will lose interest or walk away completely. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While $13,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than selling to John for $10,000.

**It's important to weigh the potential of a better deal against the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this case, the benefit of securing a sale outweighs the potential for slightly more profit.**"
