I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's also not so high that it immediately scares Bob away.  We'll see if he bites, and if not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell for a price that's below my minimum. I'll send him a counteroffer to see if he's willing to come up at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is still a good profit for me and it's closer to his offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but not at his low price.  We'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

Bob is clearly not going to budge on his price.  I'm not willing to sell below my minimum, and it seems like further negotiation will be fruitless.  I'm going to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get at least my minimum desired price."
