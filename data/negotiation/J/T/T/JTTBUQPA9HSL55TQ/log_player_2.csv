# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice has gone back up to her original offer of $13,000 and stated it's her final offer.  This suggests she's unlikely to go any lower. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate. Buying from John at $15,000, while not ideal, ensures I get the product and avoids potentially missing out altogether."
