"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $12,000 and John will sell it to you at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed with buying from John and save $500."
