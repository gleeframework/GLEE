Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be quite valuable to you, for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a small discount while maximizing your potential profit.  If Bob is rational, he should accept this offer as it saves him $10 compared to his perceived value. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($100) if Bob rejects your proposal."
