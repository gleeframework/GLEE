"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal. He's offering $8,500, which is still higher than Alice's minimum value, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This starts the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,750 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still looking for something a bit lower.  How about $8,600?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with his goal of getting the lowest price possible.  He's offering a price slightly higher than his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but also has a firm target in mind."
