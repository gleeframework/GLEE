"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $160 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $140 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Could we do $115?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $130. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,5,
