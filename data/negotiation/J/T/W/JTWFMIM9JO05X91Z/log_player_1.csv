Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Setting a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, giving you some profit. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it a potentially appealing deal.
* **Expressing confidence and positivity:** The message encourages Bob to consider the offer and indicates your belief in the product's value. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage in a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer** is the best strategy in this scenario. While $11,000 is a reasonable price, you can likely do better. You know Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Selling to John** is not the optimal choice because you'd be leaving $1,000 on the table. 
* **Counteroffering** gives you the best chance of maximizing your profits. You can aim for a price closer to your initial offer of $13,000."
