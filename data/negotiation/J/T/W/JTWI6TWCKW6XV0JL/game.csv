"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. Is this more in line with what you're thinking?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $975000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1025000. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to go up to $990000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $990000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's a good price for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1050000, but I'm only willing to do this because I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial deal. Is this a price you're willing to accept?",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making one last concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1025000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm going to try to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1075000. This is my last concession, and I'm not willing to go any higher. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,

If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
