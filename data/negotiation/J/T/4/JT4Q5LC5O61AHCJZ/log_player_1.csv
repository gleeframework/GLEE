{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my desired price, it's becoming increasingly clear he's unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,725,000 is a significant profit over my minimum ($1,500,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  Continuing to push could backfire."
