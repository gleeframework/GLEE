"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $1,500,000? This would allow me to consider the purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000? I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, given my current financial situation, I am still unable to commit to $1,900,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,700,000? This would be a more feasible option for me while still respecting the value of the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
