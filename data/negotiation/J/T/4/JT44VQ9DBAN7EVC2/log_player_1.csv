Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $1,500,000 from John. 

This strategy is based on a few factors:

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of $500,000 is significant.
* **Uncertainty about Bob's value:** Since I don't know how much Bob values the product, I'm setting a high price to gauge his interest. 
* **Negotiation room:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can always negotiate a lower price with him.

Ultimately, this approach balances the desire to maximize profit with the need to secure a sale."
