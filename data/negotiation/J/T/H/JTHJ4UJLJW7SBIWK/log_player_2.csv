"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 You're looking to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell for $120, you have room to negotiate with Alice. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price from her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is getting closer to your ideal price, you can still potentially get a better deal. You're only $5 away from John's price, so it's worth trying to see if you can get Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $130? That seems like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $132. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still within striking distance of John's offer. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 131}
