"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $130? That seems like a reasonable compromise.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $132. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to go up to $131, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",131.0,Bob,6,
