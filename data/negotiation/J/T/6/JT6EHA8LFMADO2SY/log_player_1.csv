Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob with a sense that he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal. This means getting as close to $1,499,999 as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. I believe this offer represents a significant value considering its unique benefits."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, leaving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning ""unique benefits"" provides a reason for the high price without revealing specific details. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The tone is professional and courteous while implying that this is a serious offer.

**Important Note:**  Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but remember your walk-away point is $1,500,000 from John."
