"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  I have 6 rounds left and I want to see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I can do $1,250,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I have 4 rounds left with Bob, but he's clearly not willing to go higher than $1,250,000. This is below my minimum price of $1,500,000. John is offering me my minimum, so it's best to take his offer and close the deal."
