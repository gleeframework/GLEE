"Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll gain. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I can do $1,250,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
