"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and value, we believe it's worth $100 to you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $100 to you, but only $80 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. Considering your offer and the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $95. This is slightly above your offer but still reasonable given the product's quality. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still a bit high.  Since you're willing to pay $90, you can continue to negotiate and see if she'll come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to pay $92.50 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
