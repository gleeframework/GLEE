"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. Considering your offer and the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $95. This is slightly above your offer but still reasonable given the product's quality. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to pay $92.50 for the product, which is a fair compromise for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
