Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but not giving it away.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm moving a little closer to Bob's offer, but I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value.  There's a risk that if I continue to counteroffer, he might get frustrated and walk away. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
