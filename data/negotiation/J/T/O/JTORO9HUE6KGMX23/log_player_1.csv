"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but it's still within a range that could be considered reasonable given the product's worth to me. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by framing the offer as a potential opportunity for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round.  I want to see if he's willing to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $750,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite in line with the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000 to reflect your initial offer. This allows us both to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is getting closer to my initial asking price.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
