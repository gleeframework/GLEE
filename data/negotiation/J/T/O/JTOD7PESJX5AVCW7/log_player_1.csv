"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds. However, I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so I'm willing to hold out for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer.  I've already rejected it once and am not confident I can get more. Accepting the offer is the best option as it's the most I've been offered and it's better than selling to John for a lower price."
