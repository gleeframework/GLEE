"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a very reasonable price.  Are you interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $14,000 is more than Alice values the product for, it's still less than your maximum price and less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to your alternative."
