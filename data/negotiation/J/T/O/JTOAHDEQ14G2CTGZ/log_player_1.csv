"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  It's too early to sell to John yet, as I still have a chance to make a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to keep negotiating. Selling to John now would be a waste, as I could potentially get more from Bob. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $110.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John to avoid wasting any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob is still offering a price that's too low for me. I've already lowered my price significantly.  While I would like to get more,  it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether.  I'll sell to John for $120. This ensures I make a profit, even if it's not the ideal price."
