This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to meet your needs while still staying within my own financial goals.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still pushing for a lower price, but $950,000 is unfortunately still a bit too far below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This gives us both some room to compromise, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not sure I can go lower than this.
