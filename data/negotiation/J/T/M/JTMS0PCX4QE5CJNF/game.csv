"That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I see the value, but I'm on a budget. How about we start at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about we try $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're feeling a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $825,000 again, or I'll have to consider other options?",825000.0,Alice,9,
