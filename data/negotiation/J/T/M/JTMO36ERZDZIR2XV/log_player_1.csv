{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you want to start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Slight negotiation room:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, while still ensuring you get a great deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential gains.

By starting high and offering a reasoned justification, you increase the chances of Bob accepting your offer or countering with a price closer to your desired range."
