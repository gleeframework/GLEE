Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $16000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should still reject the offer.  While it's a bit closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for a lower price.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but he can also just go with John if he's not getting a good deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he's already made a counteroffer that Alice rejected.  This suggests Alice is not very flexible, and further negotiation might not be fruitful.  He's better off buying from John at a price that's within his budget."
