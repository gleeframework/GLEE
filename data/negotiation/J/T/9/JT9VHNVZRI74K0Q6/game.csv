I'm excited to offer you this unique product for $18000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. Let me know if you're interested!,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $10000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $16000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that I can find a similar product for closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $12000?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
