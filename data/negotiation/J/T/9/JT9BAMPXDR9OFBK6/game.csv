"Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested in the product.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to make a deal that's more in line with my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to make a deal within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1300000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference - how about $1200000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
