Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it gives you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and a good profit for me.  There's a good chance I can get a higher offer from Bob in future rounds, but there's also a risk I might not. It's best to take this offer and secure the sale."
