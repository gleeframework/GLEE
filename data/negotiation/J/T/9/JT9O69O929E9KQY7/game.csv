"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a strict budget.  Could we agree on $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget, but $700,000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you. If you're genuinely interested in making a deal, let's work towards this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
