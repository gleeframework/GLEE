"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a good price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is important to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's initial counteroffer is not a starting point for a productive discussion. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's a possibility of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob, but I need to take a more strategic approach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still represents a great value for you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I've lowered my price from $18,000 to $13,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This is a significant concession, but it still keeps my price above my minimum acceptable amount.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, emphasizing that $13,000 is a fair price given its worth to him.
* **Positive Tone:** My message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation and the potential for a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is still lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm continuing to lower my price, demonstrating my flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, highlighting the potential for a successful deal.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning the limited rounds remaining, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $5,000 less than what I could get from John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  With only a few rounds remaining, I'm still hopeful that I can convince Bob to go a little higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can push for a more favorable price.  However, if the next round doesn't yield a better result, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000. That's definitely closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Would you consider $11,500? It's a compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us given the product's value. We're running out of time, so let's make a decision that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that I'm willing to meet halfway but still hold firm on my desired price.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** I'm reminding Bob of the limited time and emphasizing that this offer represents a genuine compromise.
* **Fairness and Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the price and encourage him to see it as a fair deal.
* **Final Push:** With limited rounds remaining, this is my final push to try and get a higher price from Bob before I default to selling to John."
