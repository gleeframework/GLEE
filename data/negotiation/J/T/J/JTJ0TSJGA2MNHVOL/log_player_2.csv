Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which still represents a great value for you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is still lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,000. That's definitely closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a little more.  Would you consider $11,500? It's a compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us given the product's value. We're running out of time, so let's make a decision that works for everyone. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000.  It's better to secure the product from John for $10,000 than risk Alice not budging further and missing out on both deals."
