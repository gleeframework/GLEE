Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This is crucial information in a negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, and selling to Bob at a higher price than John offers ($8,000) is key.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $10,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of securing a $2,000 profit over selling to John makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
