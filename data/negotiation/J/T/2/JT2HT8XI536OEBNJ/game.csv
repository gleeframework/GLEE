"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to find a solution that works for us both. This price still reflects the product's value, but allows for some flexibility. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
