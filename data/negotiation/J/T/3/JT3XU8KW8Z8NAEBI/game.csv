"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than $12,500 on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there.  $13,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely useful.",13750.0,Alice,5,
