"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is close to his maximum price but still leaves room for negotiation.  He's also providing a reason for his counteroffer, which may help Alice understand his perspective and make her more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than $12,500 on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,250. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still more than his maximum price of $12,000. He can still try to negotiate a lower price and might be able to get closer to his target.  Furthermore, since Bob has 10 rounds, there's still time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, offering a price closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget constraints. He's also emphasizing a desire to reach a compromise, which may encourage Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there.  $13,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, $13,750 is still above his maximum of $12,000.  With only 5 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John at his maximum price. This guarantees he gets the product and avoids potentially getting stuck with a higher price in later rounds."
