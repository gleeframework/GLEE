"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly opening message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" gives Bob an opportunity to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

**Strategy:**

I want to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. This starting offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially close the deal in the first round. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counter-offer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob's counteroffer shows interest, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $150 is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially secure a higher price by making a counter-offer in the next round. I'll use this opportunity to try to bridge the gap between our desired prices while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $135 represents a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $125.
* **Fairness Appeal:** I use language like ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  ""Let me know if that works for you"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a price point that both Bob and I are comfortable with. This counteroffer is a calculated move to potentially close the deal in this round. If Bob rejects, I can still consider John's offer or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's a significant improvement from his previous offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, accepting this offer gives me a solid starting point for potential future negotiations if I want to try and get a higher price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Rejecting this offer risks losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate and is likely getting closer to his maximum. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $130 is a good compromise that allows me to secure a sale and potentially open the door for further negotiation in the future if I want to explore getting a higher price."
