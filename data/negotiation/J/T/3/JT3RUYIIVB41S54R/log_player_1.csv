Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value.  

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm prepared to counter-offer if he rejects my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, offering Bob a lower price than my original offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable value and reflecting my belief in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and while I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly more than selling to John and the negotiation seems to be stalling. I'll accept his offer."
