"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant profit for me and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal, as he's willing to pay $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. He's clearly willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. Accepting his offer at $8,500 is a better deal than selling to John for $8,000."
