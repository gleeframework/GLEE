"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, reflecting its value to me. This is a fair price given my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. Considering its value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, given the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget limitations."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your commitment to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, given its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $825,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. I've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge further.  Rather than risk continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the product entirely, I'll take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000."
