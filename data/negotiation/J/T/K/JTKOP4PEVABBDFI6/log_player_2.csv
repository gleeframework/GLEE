"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers and Bob might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal for Bob without unnecessary risk."
