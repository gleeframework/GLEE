"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
