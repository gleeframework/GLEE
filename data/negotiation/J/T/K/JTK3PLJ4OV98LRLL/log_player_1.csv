Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $120 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $150, making it appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** It allows for some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer, without immediately jeopardizing my profit. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message can help create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $105 is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I emphasize that $105 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth. 
* **Staying firm on my minimum:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below $105, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still significantly lower than my desired range.  Considering the back-and-forth with Bob, I'm not optimistic about reaching a mutually agreeable price.  It's more profitable to sell to John for $150, ensuring a secure sale and maximizing my earnings."
