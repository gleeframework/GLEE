Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
 
**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a high anchor price significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both your minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. It seems likely he's anchoring low, hoping I'll make a significant concession.  We should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider  $11,000.  This is a fair offer considering its benefits."", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price to show flexibility, but I'm still staying well above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price. The message also emphasizes the value the product offers to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value, but I need to stay within a certain budget.  How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is inching up, but very slowly.  It's clear he's aiming for a price well below your minimum. Rather than continue a potentially lengthy negotiation with an uncertain outcome, it's more strategic to accept John's guaranteed offer of $10,000."
