"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below the value I was hoping to get, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I can meet you at $10,500, which is closer to my minimum price. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
