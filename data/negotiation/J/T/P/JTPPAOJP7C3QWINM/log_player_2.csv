"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's always worthwhile to try and negotiate a better price, especially since you have 10 rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer than my maximum budget of $10,000 to leave room for negotiation. This also signals that I'm serious about buying the product but am hoping to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit below the value I was hoping to get, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable paying $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500, which is still below my maximum budget of $10,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will lead to a compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I can meet you at $10,500, which is closer to my minimum price. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept since we are close, I want to see if I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I also want to be strategic in the use of my remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, so I'm going all-in with my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept. 

If she rejects, I'm prepared to buy from John in the next round. However, I'm hoping Alice will recognize that this is a good deal for her considering she's already lowered her price considerably."
