"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  Could you meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get the best price, but $10,250 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
