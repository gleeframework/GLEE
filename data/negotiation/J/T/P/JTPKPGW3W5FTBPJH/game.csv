"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $800,000, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so let's see if we can make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
