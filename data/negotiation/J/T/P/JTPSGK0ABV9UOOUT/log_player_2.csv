"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to be close to my max budget of $1,000,000 while leaving room for negotiation.  This should also demonstrate that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,050,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still just a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for my maximum price now, as I'm getting closer to the end of the negotiations and I don't want to lose out on the potential deal. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's within her desired range and also my limit.  If she rejects, I'll have to consider the alternative offer from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $1,025,000, which is just $25,000 above your maximum offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still slightly above my maximum budget. While she has demonstrated flexibility, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk a further negotiation. To ensure I get the product and avoid the possibility of losing out entirely, I will buy from John at $1,000,000. This guarantees me the product within my budget and saves valuable negotiating time."
