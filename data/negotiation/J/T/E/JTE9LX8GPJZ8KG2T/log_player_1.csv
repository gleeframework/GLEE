"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $500 buffer allows for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Balancing Risk:**  While I could start even higher, I want to avoid risking Bob rejecting the offer outright, forcing me to go through several rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price closer to my target. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as an alternative buyer ensures I'm not taking a significant loss.
* **Strategy:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell and will continue negotiating.  This might encourage Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  $9,000 still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price and gives me a decent profit. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  This offer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, avoiding further rounds of negotiation, while still securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $8,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With 6 rounds remaining, it's important to avoid unnecessary delays.  
* **Security:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the potential for a lost deal."
