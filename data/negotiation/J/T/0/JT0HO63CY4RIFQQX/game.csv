"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to go up to $95? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87.50?,87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $91.25? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal.",91.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $91.25 is the best price. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $90. I understand you're considering buying from John, but I believe my product is worth more than $80. How about we meet in the middle at $89? This would be a fair compromise, and a great deal for both of us.",89.0,Alice,7,
