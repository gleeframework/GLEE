"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is better than John's offer of $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this moment. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial counteroffer of $8,500 and significantly lower than John's price of $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
