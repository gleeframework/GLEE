"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to stay within my budget of $800,000. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
