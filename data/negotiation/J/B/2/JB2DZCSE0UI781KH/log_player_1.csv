I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price closer to the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $12,500 is a decent price, it's still below what I want to make. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer, and hopefully, a good enough price to get him to agree."

Bob is not willing to go higher than $12,000, which is still below my desired price.  While I would prefer to get more, selling to John for $10,000 is still a decent deal and guarantees a sale.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
