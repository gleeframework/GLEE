"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000 and its value to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
