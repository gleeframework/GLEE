"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad to hear you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1300000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I think $1300000 is a bit below the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $1350000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1350000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $1325000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I think $1325000 is still a bit short of the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1375000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one last serious offer. I'll meet you at $1340000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider it a final offer.",1340000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1340000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1380000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1380000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've reached my limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'll meet you at $1300000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
