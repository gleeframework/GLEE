"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but not too far off. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. I believe this price is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first offer. I believe I can still get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. I believe this price is a good compromise, showing flexibility while demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Given Bob's persistent low offer, I believe it's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John. There's only a limited number of rounds left, and I don't want to risk further negotiation leading to a worse outcome. John's offer guarantees me my minimum valuation, and it's better than risking losing more money by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
