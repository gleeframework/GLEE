"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8,250?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  If that works for you, we can finalize the deal. ",8000.0,Bob,4,
