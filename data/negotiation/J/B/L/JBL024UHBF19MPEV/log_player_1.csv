Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you set a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this initial price, his counter-offer is more likely to be closer to your desired range.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob.
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages open dialogue, increasing the chances of finding a mutually agreeable price. 

**Important Note:**  While you aim to maximize profit, be prepared to potentially negotiate down towards $15,000 if Bob seems hesitant. You don't want to lose a potential sale by being too inflexible."
