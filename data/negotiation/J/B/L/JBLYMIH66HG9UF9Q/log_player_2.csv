"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $1,750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which reflects a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and risks the chance of Alice increasing her price or the deal falling through.  It's better to secure a good price now than risk paying more with John.
