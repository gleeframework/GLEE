{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob."
