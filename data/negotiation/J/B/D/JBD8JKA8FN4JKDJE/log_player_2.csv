"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's a good deal. There's no advantage to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
