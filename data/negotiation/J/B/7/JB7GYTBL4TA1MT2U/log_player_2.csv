"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  
* Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000. 
* There are 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range for both parties. 
* **Express willingness to negotiate:** By mentioning ""open to further discussion,"" Bob signals that he's not completely inflexible and is open to finding a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Highlighting Bob's budget:** By stating it's his ""best offer,"" Bob puts pressure on Alice to consider his financial constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,500. This is my best counteroffer so far. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

* **More room for negotiation:**  There are still 7 rounds remaining, providing  opportunity to continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer gives Bob more leverage to get a better price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's previous counteroffer was close to Alice's current offer, suggesting that they might be able to reach an agreement somewhere in between."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

* **Close to a deal:** Alice's offer is only $250 above Bob's last offer. This suggests they are getting close to a deal, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a breaking point:** Alice has declared this her ""final offer,"" meaning further negotiation is unlikely to be productive. 
* **Above Bob's budget:**  Even with this final concession, Alice's offer of $9,200 is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000.
* **Limited remaining rounds:** Only 3 rounds remain, and any further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.
* **John's offer is better:**  Bob can secure the product from John for $8,000, which is a better price than what Alice is currently offering. It's more advantageous to accept John's offer and avoid any further negotiation."
