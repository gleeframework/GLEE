"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $12,500. However, I need to be transparent that I have another buyer interested at a price very close to this.  Let me know your decision soon.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for being upfront.  That other buyer sounds serious! I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",11000.0,Bob,6,
