Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $8,100?

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle.  While I could try to negotiate further, $8,100 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to settle for John's higher price."
