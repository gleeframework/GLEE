"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth.  I'm asking $1,400,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to reach an agreement that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to get a better deal.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $1,300,000.  While a further counteroffer might save a bit more, the risk of Alice rejecting it and driving the price back up or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price is significant.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product within his budget and avoid potential risks."
