"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value to me.  I believe this price is fair and represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price still allows you to profit from the product, and it's a fair reflection of its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.
