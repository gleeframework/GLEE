"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value to me.  I believe this price is fair and represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  Considering my maximum is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant saving for you, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price still allows you to profit from the product, and it's a fair reflection of its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise for both of us and would allow for a mutually beneficial transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
