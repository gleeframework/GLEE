Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  Considering my maximum is $800,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant saving for you, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
