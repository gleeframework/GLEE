{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, strategically positioned between your minimum acceptable price of $100 and the product's worth to Bob of $150.  It gives Bob room to negotiate while also demonstrating your willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to achieve a price closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
