"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  $130 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $150.
* **Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.** There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  That seems fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is below Bob's maximum price of $150.**  
* **It's a better deal than buying from John for $150.** 
* **Bob has already rejected one counteroffer, so continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.**

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal at a better price from John outweighs the potential of saving a few more dollars."
