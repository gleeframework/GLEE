"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm happy to meet you at $11,000, which is the absolute most I can do.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for a great product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
