"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's above my minimum and closer to my desired price than selling to John.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether."
