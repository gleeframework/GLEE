"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend less than $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal considering the value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
