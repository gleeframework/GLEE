Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than I'd like.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a price closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not quite there yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

We've reached a point where Bob and I are not close to an agreement.  Even though $975,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum of $1,000,000. It's time to move on and sell to John, who's already willing to pay my price."
