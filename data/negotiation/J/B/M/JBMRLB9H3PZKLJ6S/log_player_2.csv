"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason: While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to negotiate a better price.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, there's room for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still not the best possible deal. I can try to push for a lower price with a counteroffer.  There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get it down to $900,000 or even lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on it. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice has come down to $975,000, which is within my acceptable range.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential deadlocks."
