Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $13,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price still earns a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $13,500 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying above Bob's perceived value of $12,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning listing it publicly implies Bob could miss out if he doesn't act soon.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at the highest possible price while keeping the guaranteed offer from John as a safety net."
