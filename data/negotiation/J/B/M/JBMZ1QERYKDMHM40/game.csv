"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  While I love the product, $11,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? That's the highest I can go right now.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,750? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and it gives you some room to work with. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,
