Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $78 is still a bit short for me. I'm willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I can go.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John."
