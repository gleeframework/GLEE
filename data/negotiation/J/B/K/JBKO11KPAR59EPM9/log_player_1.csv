Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. My initial price is $1,300,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the potential value for Bob while setting a clear price point. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start high but not too high:**  I want to maximize my profit but also ensure Bob doesn't immediately reject the offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This allows for back-and-forth and potentially a better outcome for both of us.
* **Stay flexible:** If Bob makes a counteroffer, I can consider it. I have a backup option with John, so I'm not pressured to accept any price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price allows for a fair profit for you and is within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup option with John.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Backup Plan:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so I have the luxury of being more selective. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially squeeze out a better deal.
* **Value for the Product:** I believe the product is worth significantly more than Bob's offer, and I don't want to undervalue it. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product truly is exceptional and worth more than that. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price still provides a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I've countered with $1,200,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the exceptional value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding common ground, keeping the negotiation productive.

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Flexibility:** I'm still open to negotiation, but this counteroffer pushes back a bit to see how strongly Bob wants the product.
* **Gradual Adjustment:** My counteroffer is a reasonable move from my previous offer, signaling that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain Leverage:** While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to maintain leverage in the negotiation."
