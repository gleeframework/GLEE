"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. My initial price is $1,300,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can potentially get a better price than $1,000,000 from John, even if it takes a few rounds of counteroffers."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product truly is exceptional and worth more than that. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price still provides a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice has come down to $1,200,000. This is a good price, considering John is selling it for $1,000,000.  It's unlikely you'll get a better deal from Alice, so accepting her offer is the best option."
