"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price allows for a fair profit for you and is within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product truly is exceptional and worth more than that. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This price still provides a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
