"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John's price.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to go to $9,000? It's still a significant saving compared to John's price, and it allows me to keep this deal going.",9000.0,Alice,5,
