Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While I value the product at $15,000, I'm starting at $12,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for me. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I have a backup plan in John, so I don't have to accept any offer that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too far off. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate further.
* **Split the difference:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:**  I reiterate the value proposition for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" he's getting. 
* **Maintaining a profit margin:** While $8,500 is significantly less than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John's price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price, either by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,000. However, I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work for me. Would you be willing to go to $9,000? It's still a significant saving compared to John's price, and it allows me to keep this deal going."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely closing the door. 
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still within a range where I can make a decent profit. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the potential savings for Bob compared to John's price, encouraging him to consider the deal further.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still not giving in to a price significantly below my minimum acceptable value."
