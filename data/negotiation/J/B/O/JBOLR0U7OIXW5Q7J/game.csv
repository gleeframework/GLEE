"Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $925,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still giving me a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
