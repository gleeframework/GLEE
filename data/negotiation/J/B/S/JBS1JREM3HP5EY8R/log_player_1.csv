Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $17,000 is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob but not too outrageous. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counteroffer, potentially leading to a deal within a reasonable range.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product, making Bob more inclined to negotiate.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the price and my desire to close the deal.
* If he makes a counteroffer too low, I will be prepared to counter again or to sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Accepting it would mean no profit. 
* **Counteroffer:** I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer that is slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $15,000 is the minimum I can accept, I'd be willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Motivation:** The message emphasizes my desire to reach an agreement and shows flexibility, potentially encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Slight Margin:** $16,000 still allows for a slight profit over my minimum acceptable price, making the deal worthwhile. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer, potentially moving closer to his price point if the deal seems likely. 
* However, I'll also be prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob stall or if it becomes clear that he won't budge."
