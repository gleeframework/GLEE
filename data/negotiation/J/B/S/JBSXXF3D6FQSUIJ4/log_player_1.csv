Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value of the product to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation. It also positions you as a serious seller willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still below my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
This counteroffer shows that I am willing to negotiate, but I am also confident in the value of the product.  By meeting Bob halfway, I am hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
