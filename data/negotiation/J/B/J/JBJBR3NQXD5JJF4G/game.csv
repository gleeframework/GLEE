"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to buy the product for $950000. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
