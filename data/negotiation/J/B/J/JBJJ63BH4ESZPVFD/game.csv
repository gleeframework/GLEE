"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm asking for $1,450,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,450,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product, reflecting its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,350,000 yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This reflects the product's true value while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1,375,000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  What do you think?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, and I'm willing to come down just a bit more. I'm prepared to accept $1,385,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this now.",1385000.0,Alice,5,
