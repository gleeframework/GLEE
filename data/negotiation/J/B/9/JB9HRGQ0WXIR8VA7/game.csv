"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This still leaves some room for profit for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,500 is my final offer.  This leaves us both with a decent profit, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
