"Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value I place on this product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. If you're still interested, please let me know.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
