"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is selling the product for that price, it's the most logical choice to buy from John immediately. There's no reason to risk negotiating with Alice and potentially ending up paying more or running out of rounds."
