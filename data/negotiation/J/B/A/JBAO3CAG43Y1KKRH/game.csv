"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  I'd be happy to accept $10,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  $10,250 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile, though. How about $10,400? This is a small step up from your last offer, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to go there.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,300. I think this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",10300.0,Bob,6,
