"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not so high that it would immediately turn Bob away. I want to see if there's room to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's unlikely that he'll offer anything higher. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counter-offering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum price and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $120 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counter-offering with $160. I'm decreasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign that I'm serious about making a deal, and he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  I have several rounds left and I think I can get closer to my desired value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to raise his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm counter-offering with $155. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and a clear signal that I'm willing to close the deal. It's also only $5 above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is consistently offering a price lower than my minimum. I've made several concessions and reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better price from him. With only two rounds left, it's not worth the risk of rejecting his offer and ending up with nothing.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $150."
