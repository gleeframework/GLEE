``` 

This is a starting point. I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but not too high to scare him off. I'm trying to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counter his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm still trying to get closer to my desired price. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm hoping for a bit more. I'll counter again and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still a little too low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob has finally met my counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a good deal for me as it's above my minimum price and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer seems like the best option."
