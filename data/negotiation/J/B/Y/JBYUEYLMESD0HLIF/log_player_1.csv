Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher allows you to potentially maximize profit if Bob accepts.
* **Finding a Balance:** $145 is above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still a significant discount from your guaranteed sale price. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting while still securing a good profit. 
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
