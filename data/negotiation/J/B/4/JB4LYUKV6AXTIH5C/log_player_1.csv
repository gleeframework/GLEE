Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While $160 isn't my ideal price, it's a decent compromise and higher than what John would pay. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
