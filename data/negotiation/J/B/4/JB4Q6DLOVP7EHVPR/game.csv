"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great price for a product that's worth a lot more to you than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
