Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. By offering $1,500,000, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,400,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves me with a profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and it would be a waste of time to continue negotiating. It's also a better offer than John's, so I'll accept it."
