{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I already have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you want to start negotiations much higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By mentioning another buyer, you create a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball significantly.
* **Targeting above Bob's value:** The $1,300,000 price point aims to capture some of the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price, while still being potentially enticing enough for him to consider.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Depending on Bob's response and your risk tolerance, you might adjust your approach in a multi-round negotiation."
