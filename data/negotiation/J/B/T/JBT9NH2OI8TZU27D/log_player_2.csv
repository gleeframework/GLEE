"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I already have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 maximum and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
