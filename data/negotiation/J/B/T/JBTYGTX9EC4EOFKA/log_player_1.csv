I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop to $1,000,000. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It's a more realistic price point that might encourage Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is still too low.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not worth risking further negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, and it's time to move on."
