"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price or at least a price that's closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is only $500 below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  This is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting the deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a deal close to my minimum than risk losing the sale completely."
