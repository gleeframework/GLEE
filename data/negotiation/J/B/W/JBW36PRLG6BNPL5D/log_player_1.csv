Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low,  and I'm unwilling to sell for that amount. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,200,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but shows my willingness to negotiate. This price also leaves some room for further negotiation while ensuring I get a value closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm unwilling to settle for such a large difference from my desired value. Since John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'll choose to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
