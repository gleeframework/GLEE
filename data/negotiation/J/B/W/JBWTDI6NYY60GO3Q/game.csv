"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it,  which still represents a significant investment on my part.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your offer. However, we need to maintain our product's value in the market. Therefore, we propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. We hope this aligns better with both our interests.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and settle on $850,000. I'm confident this is a price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
