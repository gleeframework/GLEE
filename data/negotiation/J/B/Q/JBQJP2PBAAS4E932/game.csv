"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
