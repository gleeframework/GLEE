"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price, and I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.  I'd rather secure a sale at a decent price than continue to haggle and potentially lose the sale altogether."
