"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,400,000. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and this price allows for a considerable margin. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it very attractive. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob can get the product from John for a much lower price."
