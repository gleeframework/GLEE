"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested. While $8,200 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,800?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is still just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,650? This feels like a fair compromise considering the product's value.",8650.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,400 is still too far below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer.  It's important that we find a solution that's fair for both of us, and I think this price strikes that balance.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,7,
