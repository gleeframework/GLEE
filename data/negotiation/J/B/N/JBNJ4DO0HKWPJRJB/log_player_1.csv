Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  My message doesn't close the door on a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of a sale while leaving room for negotiation, ensuring I don't immediately lose Bob as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $150 I need to make a profit.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.  I can likely push him higher with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me leverage in this negotiation.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I aim to reach a price closer to my minimum or even secure a price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair return.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above minimum:**  $115 is still above my minimum of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, hoping to close the deal.

This strategy aims to find a compromise point that satisfies both parties while ensuring I meet my minimum profit requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $110 is only $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've already gone through a few rounds, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and unproductive. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150 if this deal falls through.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and ensuring a profit, even if it's not my ideal price. The risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a rejection or further delays is too high compared to the relatively small difference in price."
