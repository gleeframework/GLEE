"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16500. This price still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $16500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",14500.0,Bob,4,
