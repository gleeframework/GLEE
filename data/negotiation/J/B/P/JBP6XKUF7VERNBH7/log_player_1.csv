{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and still allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate if he's interested.  However, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for me to counter if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000 for your product. This is higher than my initial offer and closer to your original asking price, which I hope will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's still not ideal, it's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product without needing to go through further negotiation rounds.  It's also better than selling to John for $15,000, as it saves me the effort and potential time spent negotiating."
