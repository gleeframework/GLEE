"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,250?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like your thinking, and I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,5,
