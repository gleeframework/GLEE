It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $10,000."

I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer, hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  If she's firm on a higher price, I can always go to John as a backup."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still significantly less than Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money."

Alice is getting closer to my price limit, but I'm not confident I can get her any lower.  John is offering a guaranteed price that's within my budget, so I'm going to take that option."
