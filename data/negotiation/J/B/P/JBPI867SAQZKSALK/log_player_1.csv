Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price significantly lower than Bob's perceived value increases the likelihood of acceptance. Alice avoids the risk of going to John, her backup buyer.

**Important Note:** This offer balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but the potential for higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
