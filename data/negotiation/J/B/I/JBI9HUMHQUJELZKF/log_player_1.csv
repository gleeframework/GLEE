I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  I'm sure we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 112.5}

Round 4

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $108 is getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to settle too quickly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $108 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to meet me at $109? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to $110, it's getting late in the negotiation and I want to avoid the risk of losing the deal.  At $109, I'm still earning more than I would by selling to John."
