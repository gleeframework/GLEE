"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable amount ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than the value he places on the product ($8,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone in my message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is a starting point, I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.
* **Exploring Options:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my absolute minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and highlighting that this price is fair for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make the counteroffer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Selling to John as a Backup:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open in case the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price. However, $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try $9,250. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your interest and my need to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm raising my offer by $250, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Motivating Acceptance:** I'm emphasizing that this is a price that allows both of us to ""make this deal work."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your previous offers and am willing to go up to $8,750 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic and maximize my potential earnings. 
* **Possibility of a Better Deal:** I'm not convinced that I can't get a better price with continued negotiation, especially given John's offer of $10,000.
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, so I need to be confident that I can secure a price higher than that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about making this deal happen, I believe this is our final offer. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm setting this as a final offer to put pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Lowering the Price:** I'm slightly lowering my previous offer to show some flexibility, but I'm still above my minimum price. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm emphasizing the need for a quick decision.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this careful consideration and am willing to pay $8,875 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle of our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, the potential for significant gains is limited.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $10,000, which is a safe and secure outcome.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price in the next round, there's also a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer, leaving me with no deal and only one round remaining.

Given the limited time, the potential for a better outcome is limited, and John's offer provides a guaranteed profit, it's more prudent to sell to John at this point."
