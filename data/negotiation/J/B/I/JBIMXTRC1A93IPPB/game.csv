"Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $8,000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price. However, $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's try $9,250. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your interest and my need to cover my costs.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your previous offers and am willing to go up to $8,750 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about making this deal happen, I believe this is our final offer. ",9000.0,Alice,7,
