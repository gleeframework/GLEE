Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to desperately lowball the price."
