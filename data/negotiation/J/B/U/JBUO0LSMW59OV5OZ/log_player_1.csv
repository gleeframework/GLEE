Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just ""given its value,"" can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""before I list it publicly,""  you subtly remind Bob that other buyers exist, potentially motivating him to act quickly.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat-out rejects it, you can always lower the price slightly in a subsequent offer. 

Remember, you have a strong fallback position with John, so don't be afraid to aim high with Bob!"
