"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice since her offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses continued interest while clearly stating the price is too high. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court and allows us to gauge her willingness to negotiate downwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value, and it's closer to my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to her valuation, but we still have room to negotiate.  While $12,500 is a better price, it's worth seeing if we can get it closer to $12,000 before considering accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're acknowledging Alice's counteroffer and showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to her price. 
* **Firm but Fair:** Offering $11,500 keeps the pressure on Alice while still leaving a small margin for her to potentially accept and make a profit.
* **Time Constraint:** We're aware that we have the option to buy from John for $15,000.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a significant saving compared to John's offer."
