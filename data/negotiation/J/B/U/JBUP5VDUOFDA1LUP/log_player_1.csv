"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $9,500. It's a great deal and I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Fairness & Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product and tries to frame the price as fair.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going all-in with my initial offer, leaving space for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $10,000, so selling to John is always a safe option.
* **Room for improvement:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's a decent start to negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to gauge his commitment and see if he's willing to move closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a good price for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair deal for both of us.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum selling price, so I'm not taking a major loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $8800? I think that's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $8,800 is still below my minimum selling price of $10,000.
* **John is a backup:** I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I don't need to accept a lower price yet.
* **Negotiating strategy:** I'm using the rounds to test Bob's commitment and see if he's willing to move closer to my target price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's a possibility of getting closer to $9,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This price is a good compromise and reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm reducing my price from $9,000 to $9,250, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm still above my minimum selling price of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Appeal to compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining pressure:** I'm not giving in too quickly, hoping to push Bob further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8750. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum selling price of $10,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6 of 10, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds. 
* **John is a guaranteed deal:**  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation. 

It's better to guarantee a good price with John than to risk a lower price or a failed negotiation with Bob."
