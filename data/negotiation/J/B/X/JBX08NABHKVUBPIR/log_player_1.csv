Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to Bob's perceived value.  I'm leaving a decent margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still securing a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident that I can push for a higher amount. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll accept this price, as it's still a good deal for him and a solid profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but we're still quite far apart.  Given that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
