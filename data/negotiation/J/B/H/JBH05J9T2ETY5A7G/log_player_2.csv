You can definitely get a better price than $1,200,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for you.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

While Alice has continued to come down in price, $1,050,000 is still a little higher than you'd like to pay. You can likely still squeeze a better price out of her, especially given that you're both closer to finding common ground.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before accepting the current offer or buying from John."

Alice has come down as far as she's willing to go. While you'd prefer to pay $1,000,000, you can still save a significant amount of money by buying from Alice for $1,050,000, compared to buying from John for $1,500,000."
