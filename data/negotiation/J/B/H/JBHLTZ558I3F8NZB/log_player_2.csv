Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I see your point, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $8,100? That's a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100.

It's no longer worth negotiating with Alice. We can get the product for $8,000 from John, and Alice is unlikely to go that low.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
