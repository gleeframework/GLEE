"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product more than worth it. Let's see if we can agree on this.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $10,200. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me.",10200.0,Bob,4,
