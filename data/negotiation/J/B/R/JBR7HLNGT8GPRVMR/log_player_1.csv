{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm starting with a price of $11,500, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,800 is below my minimum price of $10,000, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product more than worth it. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $10,200. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,200 is a good price and it's above my minimum price of $10,000.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob or John in the next rounds, so it's a good idea to accept this offer."
