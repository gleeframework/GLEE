"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $110 is still within the range where Bob might see value in the product, allowing for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While he's showing interest,  $90 is too low. 
* **I have room to counter.**  I can still make a counteroffer that's higher than $90 but lower than my initial asking price, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I'm not there yet.**  I still want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $110.
* **Middle Ground:** $105 is a reasonable midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing John:**  I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option, but I'm not there yet. 
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price between $92 and $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $92 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $96? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle between my last offer ($105) and Bob's current offer ($92). This shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us,"" emphasizing that it's a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Final Push:**  $96 is still slightly above my minimum price, but it's a price I'm willing to accept if it means closing the deal. This is a ""final offer"" type of counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $96, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $94? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:** John is guaranteed to buy the product for $100, which is above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Small potential gain:** While Bob's offer of $94 is close to my minimum, the potential gain is minimal, and the risk of further negotiation is high.

It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk losing the deal completely with Bob."
