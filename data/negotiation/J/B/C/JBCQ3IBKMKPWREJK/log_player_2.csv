"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Could you do $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 maximum. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  Being respectful and offering a concrete counter-offer makes it more likely Alice will continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further. $100 is getting close to our walk-away point, but there's no harm in trying for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $95? That seems fair."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:** We're making smaller concessions now ($5 instead of $10) to signal that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **""Splitting the Difference"" Tactic:** This is a common negotiation technique that can feel more agreeable and potentially lead to a quicker resolution.
* **Staying Below Walk-Away:** We're still comfortably below our $120 walk-away point, keeping John as a backup option."
