Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you.,130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I believe $130 is a bit high for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $110? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, though. How about we meet at $122? It's still a great price for the product, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession.",122.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $123? It's still a great price for the product, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession.",123.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $118, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm eager to make this deal.",118.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $118. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $121? It's still a great price for the product, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession.",121.0,Alice,9,
