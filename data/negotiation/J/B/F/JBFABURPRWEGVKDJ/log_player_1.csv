Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to be friendly and encourage Bob to consider the offer by highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  $175 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, leaving some room for me to negotiate down if needed."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet at $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm trying to keep the conversation positive and reiterate the value of the product.
* **Still above minimum:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me some room to negotiate if needed.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. Rather than continue to haggle, I'm better off selling to John for $150. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
