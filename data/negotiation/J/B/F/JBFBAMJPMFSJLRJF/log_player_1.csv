Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that it's worth more than Bob might initially think. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly signal to Bob that he might lose out on the product if he doesn't take the offer.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We only know Bob values the product at $8,000. Offering a price significantly higher might make him immediately reject the offer.
* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer is just the start. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
