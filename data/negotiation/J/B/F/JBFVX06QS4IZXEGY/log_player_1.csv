Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

``` 

While $9,300 is less than what I would like, it's still a good deal considering Bob's initial offer. It's also only $100 less than my last counteroffer, so it seems like we're close to an agreement. If I continue to negotiate, I risk Bob walking away or needing to make a counteroffer that's even lower. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
