"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking to get the product for a price closer to $1000000. Would you be willing to come down to $1050000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to come down to $1075000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, which would be $1075000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1025000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1030000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
