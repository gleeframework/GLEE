{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking to get the product for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to come down to $1075000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, which would be $1075000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $1025000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1030000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to meet you at $1027500. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I think we're getting close to the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $1028000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,028,000, which is only $2,500 more than my last counteroffer. Given that we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Accepting this offer saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for both of us."
