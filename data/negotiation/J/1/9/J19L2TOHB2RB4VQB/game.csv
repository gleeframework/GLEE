"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to me is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $825,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $750,000. Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $775,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",775000.0,Alice,5,
