"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your initial offer.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's compromise at $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals.",900000.0,Bob,4,
