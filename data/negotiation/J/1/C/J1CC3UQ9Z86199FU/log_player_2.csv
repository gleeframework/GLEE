Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your initial offer.
