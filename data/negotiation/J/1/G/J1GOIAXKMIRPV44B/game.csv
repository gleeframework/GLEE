"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is unique, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not quite there, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
