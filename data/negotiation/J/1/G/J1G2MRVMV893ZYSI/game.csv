"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above what I'd get from another buyer. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price is still well within your budget and reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. ",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
