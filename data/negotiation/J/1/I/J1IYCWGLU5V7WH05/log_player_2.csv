Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a great deal for both of us!

I'm still aiming to get the product for as close to $100 as possible.  Alice's offer of $110 is still a bit high, so I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $108 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $110, and we can finalize this deal.  It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

Alice is sticking to $110, and while I'm happy she's come down in price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer for $100."
