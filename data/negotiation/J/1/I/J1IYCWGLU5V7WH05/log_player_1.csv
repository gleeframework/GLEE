{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still below your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly tone and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While it is tempting to take the $105, we can likely get closer to our minimum price of $120 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. Would you consider $108? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $108 is closer to our minimum, we can still try to squeeze out a bit more. There's a good chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher to secure the deal, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $108 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $110, and we can finalize this deal.  It's a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
