{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Running out of time:** This is the penultimate round. There's only one more round left to negotiate with Alice.
* **Small price difference:**  While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still $125 higher than your last counteroffer. 
* **Significant savings:** Buying from John will cost you $12,000, but it guarantees you'll get the product.  This is a $3,025 savings compared to Alice's current offer.

**Conclusion:**  Given the time constraints and the potential for significant savings, buying from John is the most logical decision at this point."
