Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $140 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $130. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, there's a strong chance she won't go lower than $130. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $120 from John."
