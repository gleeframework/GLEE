{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject it and attempt to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $100 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $80 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's more advantageous to sell the product to him and guarantee my desired profit."
