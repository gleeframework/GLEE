Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for a product in excellent condition. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
