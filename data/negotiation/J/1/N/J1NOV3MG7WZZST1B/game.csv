"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price for a product in excellent condition.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",12250.0,Alice,3,
