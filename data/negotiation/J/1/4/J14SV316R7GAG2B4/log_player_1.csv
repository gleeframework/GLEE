Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and still provides a substantial profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation and the potential loss of a sale to John due to time constraints.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out the negotiation could lead to frustration and potentially harm the relationship, making a future deal less likely."
