Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product can bring you a lot of value beyond $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only comfortable paying $10,000. I'm sure you can find another buyer willing to pay closer to your asking price.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm also confident in the value this product offers.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very reasonable price for the benefits you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm going to stick to my offer of $10,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear Bob is unwilling to budge beyond $10,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome for me. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $10,000 and moving on."
