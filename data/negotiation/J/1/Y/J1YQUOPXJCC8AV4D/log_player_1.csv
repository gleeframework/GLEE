"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe my product is worth it. If Bob rejects, I'll have a better sense of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly.  I also have the safety net of John's offer, so I'm not overly concerned about losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can potentially get more from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can use his initial offer as a starting point for my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's lower offer while still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that encourages Bob to negotiate further without him feeling pressured to accept a price he finds too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has raised his offer to $850,000, which is closer to my desired price. This is a good deal for me, considering I can always sell to John for $800,000.  I'm confident that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher price, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
