"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a target price, but I'm still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. How about we meet in the middle at $875000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to stay above $880000. How about we meet at $885000? This is the best I can do, and I hope it's a price you're comfortable with.",885000.0,Alice,5,
