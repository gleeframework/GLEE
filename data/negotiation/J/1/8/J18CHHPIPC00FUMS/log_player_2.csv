"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  There are still 9 rounds left, which gives you plenty of time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice has already indicated she's willing to go lower than her initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a target price, but I'm still a bit higher than I'm comfortable going. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to stay above $880000. How about we meet at $885000? This is the best I can do, and I hope it's a price you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her previous offer. It's close enough to your desired price that it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential delays.  You still have 5 rounds remaining, but it's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price adjustments.  Accepting this offer saves you time and potentially avoids the risk of Alice changing her mind or even rejecting future counteroffers."
