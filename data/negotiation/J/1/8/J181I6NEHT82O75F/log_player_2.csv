"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a better price than $90 from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is slightly above Alice's value of $80 but still significantly lower than the $90 she initially offered.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is still within my budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  It's also close to my previous counteroffer, suggesting a good chance of finalizing the deal.  Further negotiation might save a few more dollars, but the risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiation drag on isn't worth it."
