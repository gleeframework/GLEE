"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,500. Given its value to you, I believe this price represents a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while respecting the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,500**, which is still lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **The offer is closer to Bob's ideal price of $13,000**. 
* **Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal** and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

Therefore, accepting the offer at $13,500 is the most logical choice to save money and secure the product."
