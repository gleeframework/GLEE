"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to sell for $825,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $775,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
