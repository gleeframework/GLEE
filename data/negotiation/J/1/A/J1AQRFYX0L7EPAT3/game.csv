"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value I place on it and still allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $875,000? This would allow me to save some money while still making a reasonable profit for you.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $912,500? This price is still a great deal for you and allows me to recover a reasonable amount of the value I place on the product.",912500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $900,000? This would be a significant improvement over your previous offer and still provide you with a fair return.",900000.0,Bob,4,
