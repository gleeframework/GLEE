"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. How about $130?  I'm sure we can work something out.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $140, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I like that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. How about $155? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for a great product like this.",155.0,Alice,5,
