"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1000000 is my absolute minimum. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. Can we discuss this further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your current offer. How about $975000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let's close this deal!",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $960000 is still slightly below my minimum.  I'm prepared to go down a bit further, but $965000 is my final offer.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this and move on.",965000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $965000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $960000, as I mentioned before. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",960000.0,Bob,8,
