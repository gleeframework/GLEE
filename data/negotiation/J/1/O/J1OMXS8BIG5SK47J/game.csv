"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure about $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
