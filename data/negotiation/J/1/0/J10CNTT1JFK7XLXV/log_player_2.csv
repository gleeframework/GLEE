"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I'd normally sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) than my actual limit ($120). This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** While low, the offer is presented as fair, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice moved closer to my acceptable price range, but it's still a bit high. I'll reject the offer and counter with a price closer to my limit, hoping she'll meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?"",
""product_price"": 112.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between our last offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my maximum.
* **Clear and Direct:** The offer is straightforward, making it easy for Alice to understand and hopefully accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $118.50. This is closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to my limit, but I'm still willing to see if I can shave off a few more dollars. John's offer is looking more tempting, but I'll try one more counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close. How about we make it a clean $115 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Limit:** I'm pushing my luck a little, offering just $5 less than my walk-away price with John. 
* **Clean Number:** The offer of a whole number ($115) can sometimes be more appealing than one with cents. This might be the nudge Alice needs. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By now, both parties have invested time in the negotiation. This offer, along with the ""call it a deal"" language, suggests I'm ready to finalize if Alice is willing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting very close!  I'm willing to go down to $117.  This is a very fair price, and it gets us both a great deal. Let's close this out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $117 is a very good price, well below Alice's initial offer and only $3 more than John's offer.
* **Time Invested:** We've already spent considerable time negotiating. Further haggling might not yield significant savings.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a lower price might backfire. Alice could withdraw her offer, leaving me to choose between a worse deal or buying from John."
