"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $1100000? It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my assessment, I believe we can find a price closer to my maximum limit. Would $700000 be within your consideration range?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your maximum limit, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. How about we meet in the middle again? Would $850000 be a compromise you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $800000 would be a fair compromise for both of us. This aligns more closely with my budget while still reflecting the value of the product. Let me know if this proposal works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! I can see that you're willing to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850000. I think it's the sweet spot for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at $825000? It's just a small step back from your offer, but I think it's worth considering.",825000.0,Alice,7,
