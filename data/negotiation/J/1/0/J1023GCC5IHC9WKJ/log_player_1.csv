{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's a bit higher than Bob's estimated value, but I want to see if I can get close to my target. I'm also leaving room to negotiate if needed."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $72.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $72 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a fair price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}

I'm lowering my offer again to $82. This is a significant concession from my initial offer and is only $2 above my minimum price.  I hope Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and accept my offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $80. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but it seems he's unwilling to go any higher. I've reached a point where I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John's offer is a sure thing, and it's time to take it."
