{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to be confident but not too aggressive at the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but it's a good sign that he's interested and willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my limit. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is above my minimum of $8,000 and getting closer to my desired price.  It's a good deal considering the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
