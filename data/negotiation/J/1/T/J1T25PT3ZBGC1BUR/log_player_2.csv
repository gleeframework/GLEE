"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1250000.  This allows for a fair profit for me while also giving you a chance to acquire something you value highly.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is only $50,000 more than what Bob would pay John, it's still an unnecessary expense. Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the financially wiser decision."
