"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $17,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $14,000. While it's closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm countering with $15,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this shows good faith while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to take the $14,000, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my target price.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm countering with my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.  If he doesn't, it's getting increasingly risky to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000.  While Bob has been persistent, he's not budging much from his initial offer.  With only four rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and ending up with less than my minimum price is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my target price and avoids further uncertainty."
