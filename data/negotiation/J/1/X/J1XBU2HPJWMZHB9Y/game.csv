"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground at $950,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from your original offer and leaves room for both of us to come away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
