"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your interest, Bob. While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $18,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me.",15000.0,Bob,4,
