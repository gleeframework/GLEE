"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I'm not willing to pay the full $1,000,000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise. I'm ready to accept $950,000. This offer still leaves a good margin for both of us and allows me to meet your needs.  Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,
