Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives us room for negotiation and I can still earn significantly more than my minimum price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is more than my minimum, I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, I've already rejected his previous offer and it's likely we're nearing a stalemate.  $9,500 is still a good deal for me and is closer to my desired price."
