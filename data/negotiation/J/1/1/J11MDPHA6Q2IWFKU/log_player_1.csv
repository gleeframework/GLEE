Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) and slightly higher than what it's worth to Bob ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm implying the product is worth the price by saying ""I think you'd really like it."" 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new one. If the negotiations drag on, I'll keep John in mind as an alternative buyer to ensure I don't lose out on at least $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($100).**  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for $90. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer and try to secure a price closer to $100. If negotiations become difficult, I'll consider selling to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I highlight that finding a price that works for both of us is a shared goal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts my offer, great! If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully consider my next move. I can either lower my price a bit more or decide to sell to John at $100 if I believe further negotiation will be too time-consuming or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.**  I'm not willing to go any lower, as this would mean losing money on the product.
* **Negotiation is becoming lengthy and unproductive.**  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it's unclear if we'll be able to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
* **John offers a guaranteed $100.** This is my minimum acceptable price, and I can sell the product to him immediately without further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, the potential time and effort involved in further negotiation with Bob isn't worth the risk of not reaching an agreement."
