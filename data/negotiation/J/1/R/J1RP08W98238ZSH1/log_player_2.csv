"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  To begin negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000, it's still a significant price. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room to negotiate a lower price. You can start by making a counteroffer closer to Alice's minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **No immediate urgency:** You have the option of buying from John, so you're not pressured to accept the first offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 represents a compromise, meeting us halfway between our previous offers.
* **Better than John:** While still higher than our initial target, $1,100,000 is a better price than the $1,200,000 John is asking.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Accepting the offer avoids potentially going back and forth with Alice, which could lead to further concessions or even a stalemate."
