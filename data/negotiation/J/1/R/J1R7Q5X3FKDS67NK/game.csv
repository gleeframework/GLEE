"I'm interested in the product, but $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly unique and sets a new standard in its category. To reflect that, I can't accept anything below $2,100,000.  I'm confident this is a price that will prove to be a smart investment for you in the long run.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
