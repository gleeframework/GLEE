"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong anchor price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob might not perceive it at that value yet.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** While I have John as a guaranteed buyer, securing a deal with Bob above $1,500,000 is preferable. I'll use John strategically as the negotiation progresses if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his initial perception of $1,000,000, indicating flexibility and strong interest in the product. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll leverage John's offer to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly unique and sets a new standard in its category. To reflect that, I can't accept anything below $2,100,000.  I'm confident this is a price that will prove to be a smart investment for you in the long run."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round ($150,000 vs. the previous $450,000) to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm continuing to reinforce the product's exceptional value to justify the high price and potentially shift Bob's perception.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not rushing to meet Bob's price. I'm confident I can leverage John's offer if needed to secure a favorable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique value, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is significantly above my minimum of $1,500,000 and represents a $900,000 increase from his initial perception of the product's value. This indicates a successful negotiation on my part.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob backing out increases. Accepting now secures a substantial profit.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further with no guarantee of a better outcome is not advantageous. Accepting now allows me to close the deal and move on to other opportunities."
