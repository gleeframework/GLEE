"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers your company.  Let's start our negotiations with this offer, and we can discuss further details.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product would be valuable to my company, but $1,750,000 is simply out of our budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering it's significantly above my alternative options.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, reflecting the significant value this product brings to your company. This is a fair compromise and a good starting point for us to find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value. While I agree it's a good product,  $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can do $1,200,000. I'm motivated to find an agreement and believe this offer shows I'm serious about purchasing the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product will bring to your company. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I can offer  $1,230,000 to demonstrate my willingness to find a middle ground. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can close the deal soon.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,230,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000.  This is a very fair price, considering the value this product brings to your company. Let's make a deal and finalize this transaction.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're invested in finding a fair price, and I respect that. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for my company, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
