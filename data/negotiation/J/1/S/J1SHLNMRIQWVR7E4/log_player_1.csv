Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so anything less than that is a loss.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  Starting with $12,000 gives me a decent profit while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is still an option:**  I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,000, showing a willingness to compromise with Bob.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $10,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price point. 
* **Maintaining John as a backup:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still go back to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Bob has already shown that he's unwilling to go much higher. 
* **John is the best option:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort, and the outcome is uncertain.  

By selling to John, I maximize my profit and avoid further negotiations with Bob."
