Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage with Bob.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin above your minimum.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** While you have a backup buyer, it's important to consider the potential downsides of Bob rejecting the offer:

* **Time Delay:** Selling to John will take additional time.
* **Potential Future Business:**  A positive interaction with Bob, even if he doesn't buy this product, could lead to future business opportunities."
