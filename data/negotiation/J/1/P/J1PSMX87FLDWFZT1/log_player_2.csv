"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This price reflects its significant value and potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While we don't want to insult Alice, we want to start significantly below her asking price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Show Interest:** The message conveys interest but also firmness about our budget limitations.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer puts us in a good position for future rounds. Alice is likely to counter, giving us more information to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, it's not a significant drop from her original offer. This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Target in Sight:** Our goal is to get as close to $700,000 as possible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice.
* **Time Consideration:** We have plenty of rounds left. It's too early to accept an offer that's still significantly above our target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counter-offer signals willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Simple and Clear:** Proposing to ""meet in the middle"" makes the offer easy to understand and digest.
* **Applying Pressure:**  We're still a considerable distance from Alice's last offer, which keeps the pressure on her to move closer to our range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $825,000. This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but her concessions are getting smaller. This suggests we're nearing her limit.
* **Margin for Negotiation:**  We're still $50,000 away from our ideal price. There's room to push a bit further, even if it's just a few thousand dollars.
* **Calculated Risk:**  We're getting closer to the point where Alice might walk away. However, we have to balance that risk against the potential savings."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up slightly, but I can't justify going any higher than $800,000. Let's make this happen."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at Alice's estimated value for the product. This offer sends a clear signal that this is our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message conveys a willingness to close the deal but also a firm stance on the price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While there's a chance Alice might reject this offer, it's unlikely she'll find another buyer willing to pay significantly more. We're prepared to walk away and go with John if necessary."
