"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This price reflects its significant value and potential for your business. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's high but still leaves room for negotiation, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I emphasize fairness to establish a good starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm prepared to lower the price if Bob counters, but I want to see how much he's willing to pay. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he is interested in the product.  
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round, but still leaving room for compromise.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price higher than $700,000 but lower than $950,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the product's value and potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise &  Fairness:**  I've lowered my price significantly from the initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.  I emphasize fairness to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Value Proposition:** I remind Bob of the product's value and its potential benefit to his business, hoping to justify the price.
* **Closing the Gap:** $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 

**Next Steps:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob counters, but I'm confident that $850,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer, aiming to find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a price of $825,000, further narrowing the gap and demonstrating my commitment to reaching a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference at $825,000. This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $825,000, I'm showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating my desire to reach a deal.
* **Finality:**  I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal to signal that I'm serious about closing the sale.
* **Value and Fairness:**  I reiterate the product's value and the fairness of the price to encourage Bob's acceptance.

**Next Steps:**  I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer.  If he rejects it, I'll have to carefully assess my options, as we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I'm still prepared to counter, but I'll also need to consider selling to John for $800,000 if a deal with Bob doesn't seem likely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up slightly, but I can't justify going any higher than $800,000. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 finally meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Success:** After several rounds, we've reached a deal that is acceptable to both of us.
* **No Further Incentive:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely.
