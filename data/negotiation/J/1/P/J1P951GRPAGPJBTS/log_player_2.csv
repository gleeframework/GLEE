**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm still hopeful I can get her down to $8,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8900. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly from her original price and is now just $100 above my last counteroffer.
*  The difference between Alice's offer and John's is $1100, which is a significant saving. 
* It's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price reductions, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with Alice."
