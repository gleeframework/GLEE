**Reasoning:**

While Bob has inched closer to a million, he seems firmly capped at a price below our guaranteed sale to John.  We've been firm and fair with our offers, and continuing to haggle with Bob risks leaving us with no deal at all when time runs out.  The guaranteed $1,200,000 from John is the best business decision at this point."
