"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and engaging in this negotiation. While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the returns it can generate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, the $950,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value this product offers. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider $1,025,000? This offer demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $975,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment, and I respect your position.  I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair given the potential returns.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $980,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",980000.0,Bob,8,
