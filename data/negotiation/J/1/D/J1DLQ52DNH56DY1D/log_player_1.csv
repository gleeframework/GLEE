Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $16,000, which reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value and potential, I'm aiming to justify the higher price in Bob's mind.  
* **Backup Plan:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so I'm not pressured to accept anything below that amount. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response and willingness to pay."
