"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $2000000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident the return will be even greater.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time. This represents the maximum value I'm willing to pay. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1750000 for the product. This reflects a significant discount from my original price and hopefully represents a fair value for both of us.  Let me know if this is something we can work with.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
