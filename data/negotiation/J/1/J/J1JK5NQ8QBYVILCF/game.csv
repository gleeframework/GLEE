"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This would still give you a great value and allow me to get closer to my desired price.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $750,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $725,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going below $750,000.  It seems like we're very close to an agreement. Would you be willing to go up to $740,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",740000.0,Alice,5,
