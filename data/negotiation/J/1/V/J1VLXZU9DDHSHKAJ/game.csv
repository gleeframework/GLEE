"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
