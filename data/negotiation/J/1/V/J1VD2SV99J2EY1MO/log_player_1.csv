{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a fair price considering Bob's value of the product. This offer allows for some negotiation room but still ensures a decent profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  It is significantly lower than what I would consider a reasonable price. I'm not going to accept that. I will make a counteroffer instead."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we settle on $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. This is the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While it's still less than I'd hoped for, it's within a reasonable range and I want to avoid the risk of him walking away or continuing to negotiate down further.  I'm willing to take the $10,250 and move on."
