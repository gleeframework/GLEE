"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing what might work best for both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's unique qualities justify a higher price point. I could consider letting it go for $2,100,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to ensure we find a figure that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique qualities, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
