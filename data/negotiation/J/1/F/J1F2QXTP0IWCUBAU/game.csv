"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is impressive, that price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  I think that's fair given its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my original asking price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $750,000? I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise again. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
