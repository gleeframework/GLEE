"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique and high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference between our last offers, and we settle on $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you at $675,000, which is just a bit above the midpoint. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
