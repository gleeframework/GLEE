"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $950,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your transparency, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $990,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",990000.0,Alice,5,
