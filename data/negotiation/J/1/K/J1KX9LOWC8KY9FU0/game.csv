"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, considering its value to me. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our previous prices.  Would you consider $1,875,000? This reflects my commitment to reaching a deal while acknowledging the significant value this product offers.",1875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,875,000 is still above my comfortable price point. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This would leave room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can find an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I feel this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,650,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to go to $1,500,000 as a final offer. This is my absolute limit, as I'm very close to purchasing from another seller at a lower price. If you're unable to accept this, I'll have to move forward with that alternative.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
