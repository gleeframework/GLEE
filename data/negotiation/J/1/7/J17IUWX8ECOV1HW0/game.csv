"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this item. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest. While $750000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $850000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of this product, and it would allow me to move forward with this transaction.
