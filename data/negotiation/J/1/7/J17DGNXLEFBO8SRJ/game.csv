"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Would you be open to discussing that?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10500? It's a fair price that allows us both to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to buy the product right now for $10200.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10200 is a serious offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you've been very accommodating, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to go up to $10300. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",10300.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a little frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but this is my final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10400. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,9,
