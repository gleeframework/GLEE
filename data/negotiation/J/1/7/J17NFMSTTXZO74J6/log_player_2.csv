"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1,300,000.  Would you be open to discussing that price point?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what John is selling the product for ($1,500,000) and closer to Bob's desired price point of $1,300,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while still saving money."
