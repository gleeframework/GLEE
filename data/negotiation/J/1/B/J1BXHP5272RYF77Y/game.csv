"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. That's the highest I can go.",7800.0,Bob,4,
