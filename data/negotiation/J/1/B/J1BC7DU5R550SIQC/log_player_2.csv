"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($90):** While this is lower than Alice's value, it's still more than you want to pay.
* **Your Alternative ($80):**  You know John will sell you the product for $80. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can get the product for your target price from John."
