Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I believe Bob will see this as a fair starting point and might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling the product, and we can reach an agreement closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  I believe I've reached the point where further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to move on and sell to John for a price that meets my needs."
