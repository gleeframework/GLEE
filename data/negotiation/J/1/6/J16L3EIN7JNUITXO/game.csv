"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $15,500. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
