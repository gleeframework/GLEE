Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, I believe $1,150,000 is a bit high. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a good return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's make it $1,100,000 and close the deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* I've countered by meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,050,000) and my previous asking price ($1,150,000). 
* This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* By framing it as a way to ""close the deal,"" I'm subtly encouraging Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds."
