Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is still above my minimum price and hopefully shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to let him completely lowball me."

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to keep negotiating, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll take the $1,500,000 and move on."
