The product is far too expensive at $2,000,000.  It's better to try negotiating with Alice or buy from John."

I'm going to start with a lowball offer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a starting point for negotiation. We'll see if she's willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still too high. I'm going to try a counteroffer before going with John."

I'm going to increase my offer to $1,500,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  Hopefully, it's closer to what she's willing to accept."
