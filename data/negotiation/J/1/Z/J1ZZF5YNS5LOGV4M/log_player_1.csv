"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll love it.  I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit, and $115 ensures that.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Leaving some room for negotiation gives Bob a reason to engage. 
* **The message is friendly:**  Building rapport can help you reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $100 is your minimum, you can likely do better. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's still room to bargain, and you have rounds to work with.
* **Selling to John is premature:**  John is a backup, but it's too early to give up on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic pricing:** $107.50 is a middle ground, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Positive message:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $107.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Profit:** While $105 isn't your ideal price, it's still a decent profit and significantly better than selling to John for $100.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, so there's a risk of the negotiation collapsing if we keep rejecting offers. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** Even though we're accepting, Bob might counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, giving us a chance to get closer to our initial goal."
