Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum valuation is $800,000, we have a strong fallback option with John. Starting with a price closer to our minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, which is a common tactic in negotiations.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""unique value proposition"" subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing our absolute bottom line.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** We lack information about Bob's negotiation tactics. Is he aggressive? Does he tend to meet in the middle? Adjusting our approach based on his personality could be beneficial in a real-world scenario.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If there's a time constraint to sell the product, it might push us to be more flexible with Bob."
