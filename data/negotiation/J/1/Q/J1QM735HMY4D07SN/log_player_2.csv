Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your creative thinking, Bob, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $130 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price you're comfortable with. You've made a good effort to negotiate, but at this point, John's offer of $80 is much more appealing than continuing to haggle with Alice."
