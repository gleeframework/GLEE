Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Leveraging the ""Anchor"" Effect:** The initial price of $19,000 acts as an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the starting point influences his perception of a ""good deal.""
* **Backup Plan:**  I know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a minimum profit. This allows me to be more ambitious with my initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't have significant time constraints. If I needed to sell quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing offer to Bob might be a better approach."
