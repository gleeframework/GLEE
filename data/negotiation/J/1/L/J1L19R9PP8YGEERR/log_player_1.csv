Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can get a better deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. If he's completely turned off by the price, you can always adjust in a subsequent offer."
