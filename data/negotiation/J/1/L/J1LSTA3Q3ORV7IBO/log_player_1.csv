"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states this is a starting point, signaling to Bob that I'm open to moving on price.
* **Building Value:**  Instead of just stating the price, I emphasize the ""opportunity"" and ""potential"" of the product to frame it as highly desirable. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gather information:**  Bob's reaction to this initial high price will be telling.
2. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob is willing to negotiate close to my asking price, it means I could potentially earn more than John's guaranteed offer. 
3. **Maintain a strong position:** Starting high allows me to make concessions throughout the negotiation while still aiming for a price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum. Rejecting this offer serves a few purposes:

* **Demonstrates firmness:**  It shows Bob I'm serious about the value of my product and not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Keeps the negotiation alive:** It allows me to steer the price closer to my target range.
* **Preserves the John option:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, I believe there's room to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognize your interest in the product. To be fair, $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet halfway at $1,075,000? This reflects my desire to strike a deal, while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant jump down from my initial price, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and just above my minimum.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Proposing to ""meet halfway"" aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my range.
* **Justification:** I've subtly reminded Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price point. 

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage a counteroffer:**  My significant concession makes it more likely for Bob to respond with a counteroffer rather than walking away. 
2. **Maintain a strong position:** I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
3. **Keep the negotiation moving:** I want to see how Bob reacts to this counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1,075,000 is still above my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and go with $962,500. This shows good faith on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I can get from John.  It's too early to accept a price below John's guaranteed offer. I need to push a bit further to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to negotiation. While $962,500 is closer, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider $1,020,000? This keeps us moving forward and acknowledges your willingness to find common ground."",
""product_price"": 1020000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Effort:**  I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by acknowledging his efforts in the negotiation.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making another concession, but this time it's smaller, indicating I'm reaching the upper limit of what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Shifting Focus to Value:** I'm subtly steering the conversation away from just splitting the difference and back to the inherent value of the product.
* **Above John's Offer:** This counteroffer ensures I'm still aiming for a price that beats John's guaranteed offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob's final offer:** The smaller concession and focus on value may prompt Bob to make his best offer. 
2. **Maintain a strong position:** I'm sending a clear signal that I'm not desperate to make a deal at any price.
3. **Prepare for a decision:** With only five rounds remaining, I'll need to decide whether to accept Bob's next offer or take John's guaranteed deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. $1,020,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's compromise at $990,000.  I believe this is a fair price that respects your needs and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,000,000. He's consistently used ""splitting the difference"" tactics and framed his offers as reaching his budget limit. While he might budge slightly, it's not worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer. 

At this point, the potential gain from continuing negotiations with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of John's offer."
