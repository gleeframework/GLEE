"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his desired price point. He should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering purchasing from another seller."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about considering other sellers, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can do $10,200, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,200 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than his desired price point.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to go with John's offer of $8,000 and save the extra $2,200.  Further negotiation with Alice may result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and Bob risks losing out on the deal with John."
