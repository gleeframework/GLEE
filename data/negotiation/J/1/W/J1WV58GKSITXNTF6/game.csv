"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering purchasing from another seller.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about considering other sellers, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can do $10,200, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",10200.0,Alice,5,
