"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This reflects the value and quality you'll be receiving.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $12,000 is simply too low for the quality and benefits this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
