Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $15,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly less than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's message indicates he's willing to pay a premium, suggesting there's room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Backup Option:**  You still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still staying closer to your desired price. It's a common negotiation tactic that can signal willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm stance on value.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces your position and provides a reason for the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** While closer to your minimum, the offer still leaves a small margin for potential further negotiation if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is above your absolute minimum of $12,000 and represents a reasonable compromise.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting a good offer now allows you to move on and potentially pursue other opportunities."
