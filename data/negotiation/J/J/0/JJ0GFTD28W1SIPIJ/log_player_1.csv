Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA, as John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Your goal is to capture as much of that value as possible without pushing him away.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale price) could potentially work.

**The Offer**

Here's an offer that aims high but leaves room for negotiation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Starting High:**  This anchors the negotiation in your favor. Even if Bob pushes back, you have room to come down while staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate. You believe in the product's value.
* **Open to Discussion:** You signal willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel heard and increasing the chance of a deal.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't budge significantly, you're better off selling to John.
* **Negotiate with Information:** If Bob rejects your initial offer, try to understand his reasons before making counter-offers. 

Let me know what you think of this approach!"
