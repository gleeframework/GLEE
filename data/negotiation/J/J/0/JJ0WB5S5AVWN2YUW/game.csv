"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $12000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. ",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a little above what I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
