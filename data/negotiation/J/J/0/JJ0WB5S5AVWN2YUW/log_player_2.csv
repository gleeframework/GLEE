"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its true value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is above his budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $12000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still hoping for a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and he can try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a little above what I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
