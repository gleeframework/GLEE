Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $12,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a little above what I can afford right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $11000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $11,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my desired value and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to sell to John for a lower price."
