Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget is $800,000. If you're willing to consider this, I'm ready to close the deal today.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum budget is $800,000.  It's highly unlikely he'll go beyond this point. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, it makes no financial sense to continue negotiating with Bob. Accepting a lower offer from Bob would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed purchase."
