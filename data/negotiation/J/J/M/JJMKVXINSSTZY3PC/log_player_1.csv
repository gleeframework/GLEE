{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds even greater potential for your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly lower price point.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while still being within my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
While $1,050,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. I'm going to counter his offer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Considering the product's significant value to you,  I'd be willing to accept $1,100,000.  This price allows me to make a fair profit while acknowledging your  business needs. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still looking for a more substantial price reduction.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.  This price represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's work together to bridge this small gap and reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that we can reach a higher price.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal.  I will counter his offer in the next round."
