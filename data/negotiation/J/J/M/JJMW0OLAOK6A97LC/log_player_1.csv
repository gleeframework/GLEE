Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a price just below her guaranteed sale to John, Alice creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially allowing Alice to earn even more."
