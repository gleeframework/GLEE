"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? ",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, I can't quite justify $875,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $880,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
