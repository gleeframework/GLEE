Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product for. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that steep a discount. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you consider $1,175,000? This reflects my willingness to be flexible while still acknowledging the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle somewhere in the middle, say $1,100,000? That's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still cutting it a bit too close to my minimum. I'll try pushing a bit further in the next round, but I need to be mindful that I have a safety net with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,137,500? This recognizes the product's value while finding a compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,120,000.  If you can meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

This offer is above my minimum and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away by further negotiation.  It's a good outcome!"
