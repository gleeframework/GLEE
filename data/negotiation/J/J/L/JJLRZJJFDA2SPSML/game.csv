"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to my budget?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a good price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still not able to meet at $130. Could we perhaps aim for $125? That would be closer to what I'm comfortable with while still allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit.",125.0,Bob,4,
