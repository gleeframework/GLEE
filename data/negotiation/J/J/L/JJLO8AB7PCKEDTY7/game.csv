"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $850000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $850000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $750000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $800000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $800000. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still willing to negotiate, but $775000 is getting closer to my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $795000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $795000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $795000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which normally costs $20000. This way, you'll get the product at the price you're willing to pay, plus some added value. So, the total price remains at $780000, but you'll get more for your money. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,7,
