"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves a potential profit margin for myself.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, framing it as a good deal for him.
* **Open Ended:** The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have 8 rounds left and still have room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired price range, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows us both to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Fairness & Value:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and again highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We are already in round 4, and I only have 6 rounds left to make a deal.  There's a risk that I could end up with nothing if I continue to reject offers.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I can still try to negotiate a higher price in the future rounds if Bob is willing to increase his offer.

This offer allows me to secure a sale and make a profit while leaving the possibility open for potential future negotiation."
