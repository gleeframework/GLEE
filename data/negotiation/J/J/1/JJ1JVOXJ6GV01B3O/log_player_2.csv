"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** $120
* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **Value to Alice:** $80

While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer, potentially securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Minimize cost while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Value:** $80 
* **Bob's Maximum:** $120 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's below Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to profit.  It signals Bob's willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a price closer to Alice's minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $90
* **Bob's Maximum:** $120
* **Value to Alice:** $80

Alice has lowered her price, and while it's still higher than Bob's ideal, it's within a range Bob is willing to pay.  Accepting the offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock, while still securing a good price."
