Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

I'm starting the negotiation high, close to Bob's perceived value. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I get a great deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It allows me to potentially lower the price during counteroffers while staying above my minimum. 
 
I've also included a message that sounds reasonable and open to discussion, increasing the chances of Bob engaging in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $95 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $95 is a good deal, placing it above my minimum selling price. While I could try to negotiate for a bit more, the difference isn't substantial enough to risk losing the sale altogether.

It's better to secure a good profit now than to risk a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
