"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal you're trying to make, but I'm really looking to get it for a bit less. How about $75? That's still a good price for both of us, and it's within my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get the product for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $85? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
