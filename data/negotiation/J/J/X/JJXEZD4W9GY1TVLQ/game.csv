"Alice,  $170 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $132.50. I'm willing to meet you at $140, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
