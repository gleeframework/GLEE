"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm interested in the product and believe it has great potential, but I'm only able to offer $600000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a game-changing product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $700000 is closer, but it's still a bit higher than what I can justify right now. I'm willing to offer $650000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident that the product will be a success.  Let's find a way to make this work.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $675000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
