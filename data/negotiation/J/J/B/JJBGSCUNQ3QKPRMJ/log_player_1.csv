Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not willing to sell for $70, as that's below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $70 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Would you be open to considering this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the potential gains are small and I'm running out of rounds. I'll take the guaranteed $80 from John."
