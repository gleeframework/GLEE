"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I do like the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $15,200, which is a bit closer to my initial price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",15200.0,Alice,5,
