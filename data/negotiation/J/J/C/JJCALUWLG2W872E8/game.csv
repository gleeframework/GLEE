"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's work together to close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we split the difference and meet at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
