"I'm interested in your product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.  This price is still fair given the value you'll receive, and it gives us both a good opportunity to close the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a solution that works for us. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $1,475,000. This is a good price for you, considering the value you'll get, and it allows me to make a profit as well. I'm confident that this is a win-win scenario. Let's close this deal.",1475000.0,Alice,7,
