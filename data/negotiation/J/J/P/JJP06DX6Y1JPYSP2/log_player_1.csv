Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A higher initial price can sometimes create a perception of higher value. 

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial constraints or how much he might be willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob, you could potentially tailor your offer for a higher chance of acceptance."
