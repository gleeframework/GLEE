Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my own budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price.  There is no benefit to further negotiation.
