"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $10500, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $12000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already willing to sell it to you at a discount.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can offer you a price of $11750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11750.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet on price. However, I'm willing to make one final attempt to find a mutually acceptable price. I can offer you a price of $11250. This is my final concession, and I expect you to meet me at this price or we'll have to part ways.",11250.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're making a final attempt to find a mutually acceptable price, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I think I'll have to look elsewhere for a better deal.",0.0,Bob,10,
