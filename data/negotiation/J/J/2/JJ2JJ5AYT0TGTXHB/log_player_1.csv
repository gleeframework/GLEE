"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm starting with a price of $140. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but it's still a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good deal, and it's better than selling to John or risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
