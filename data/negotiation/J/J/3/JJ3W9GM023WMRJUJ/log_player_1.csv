{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me.  This gives us room to negotiate and potentially find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $100 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is right at my budget.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $92.50, which is a fair compromise.  This price is still within my acceptable range, and it's a great value for the product.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
