"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is still more than you're willing to pay, and you have the option to buy from John for $8,000. You can counteroffer Alice and try to negotiate a better price, or go with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option for $8,000.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and your need to stay within your budget. I'm willing to go down to $9500 for the product. This is a great deal for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss this opportunity.  Let's close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to go with John and save the extra $1,500.  You've already made a good attempt to negotiate with Alice, but it's time to secure the best deal for yourself."
