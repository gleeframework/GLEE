Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To show my serious interest in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit above your minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation falling apart and only getting John's offer of $1,200,000."
