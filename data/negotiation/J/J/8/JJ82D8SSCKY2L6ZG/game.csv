"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To show my serious interest in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for countering. While $1,000,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,550,000.  This reflects the true value of this product.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm very interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
