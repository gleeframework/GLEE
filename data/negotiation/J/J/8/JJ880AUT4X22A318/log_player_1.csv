We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $860,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $860,000, which would be $817,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

While we could push Bob a bit further, accepting $817,500 is a good outcome. It exceeds John's offer and provides a decent profit margin. It's always best to secure a good deal when it's on the table rather than risking a breakdown in negotiations."
