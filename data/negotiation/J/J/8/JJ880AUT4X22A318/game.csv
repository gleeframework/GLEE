"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's on offer.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between what you're willing to pay and the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept $860,000, but that's my final offer.",860000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $860,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $860,000, which would be $817,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",817500.0,Bob,6,
