"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still getting a good price. Bob is unlikely to accept this offer immediately, but it sets the stage for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm aiming for a much higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price higher than what John is offering.  This shows flexibility while maintaining my goal of getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping the price to $15,500, which is just above my minimum and still a decent price.  At this point, I'm hoping Bob sees the value in closing the deal, especially since I've shown flexibility in my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what John is offering.  The negotiation seems to be getting stuck, and I don't want to risk going further down in price.  I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him.  It's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
