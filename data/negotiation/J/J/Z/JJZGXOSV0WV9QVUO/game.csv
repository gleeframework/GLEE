"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the product's unique value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for you and allows me to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're looking for a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still quite far from where I need to be. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. I hope you'll see it as a fair offer and we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. I'm offering you the product for $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",975000.0,Alice,7,
