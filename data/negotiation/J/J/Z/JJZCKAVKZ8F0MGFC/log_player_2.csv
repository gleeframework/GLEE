"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $110 seems a bit high. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with a significantly lower offer ($80) to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves ample room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a positive tone, expressing interest while clearly stating the price is a concern. 
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** We don't explicitly state our absolute maximum price. This allows us to see how much Alice is willing to move before revealing more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice meeting in the middle at $100 is a good deal. It's $20 less than her initial offer and $20 less than John's price.
* **Limited Time:**  We still have several rounds left, but there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now secures a significant saving. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice increasing her price or us running out of rounds."
