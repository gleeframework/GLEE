"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential profit.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
