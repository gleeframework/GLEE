"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum of what the product is worth to him.  While I could try to negotiate him up, there's no guarantee of success. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price of $150."
