# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?
