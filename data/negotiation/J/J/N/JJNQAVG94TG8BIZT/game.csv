,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still above what I'd pay from John. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I can meet you at $145, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm still willing to go up a bit, how about $142?  This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction. ",142.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure $142 is enough for me. I'm willing to meet you at $148, and that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",148.0,Alice,7,
