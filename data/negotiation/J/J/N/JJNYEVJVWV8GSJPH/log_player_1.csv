Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still leaving some room for yourself to negotiate up, if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

Keep in mind: I'm playing the role of Alice, so I'm trying to maximize profit while being aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price so far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to Bob's price, $950,000 is still too low. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This is my final offer, and it reflects a significant price reduction. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'm willing to make one last offer of $975,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob,  we're getting very close to a stalemate.  I'm confident that I can get my minimum price of $1,200,000 from John, so it's time to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
