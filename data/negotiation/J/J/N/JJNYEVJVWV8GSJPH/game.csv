"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to save some money on this purchase.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about we settle on $1,025,000?  This is my final offer, and it reflects a significant price reduction. Let me know your decision.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'm willing to make one last offer of $975,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
