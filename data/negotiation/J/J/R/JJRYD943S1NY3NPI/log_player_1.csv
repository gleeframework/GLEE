Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John. 

Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a perceived deal (it's less than your backup offer) while still earning you a profit significantly above Bob's valuation."
