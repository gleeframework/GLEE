Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $100,000 if Bob accepts the $1,100,000 offer.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value establishes a firm negotiation position.
* **Bob's Perspective:** The offer is still significantly lower than my minimum ($1,200,000) and provides a substantial profit opportunity for Bob (potential $300,000 profit if he leverages it right).

This strategy aims to balance securing a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
