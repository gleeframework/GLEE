"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll see the value in it.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product is undeniable, and I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a reasonable increase from my last offer and closer to your original asking price. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
