"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,800,000. This reflects the product's potential and offers you a fair price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product has value, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
