Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  This product is truly worth a significant investment. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $15,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I believe $10,000 is still a fair price considering my budget constraints. Could we possibly negotiate further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is not budging from his $10,000 offer.  It's unlikely he'll go above that amount. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation time."
