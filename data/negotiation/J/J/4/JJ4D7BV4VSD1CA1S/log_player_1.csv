Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really love. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the likelihood of him accepting while maximizing your profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $130 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to secure a sale price significantly higher than your minimum while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
