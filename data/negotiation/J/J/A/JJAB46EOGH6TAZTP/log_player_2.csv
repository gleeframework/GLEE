# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and utility, we believe it's worth $15,000 to you. Considering this, I'm offering you the chance to purchase it at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the high demand and limited availability of the product. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
