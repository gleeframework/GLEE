{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm also setting a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer you $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's not worth selling to him at that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 for the product. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price. It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
