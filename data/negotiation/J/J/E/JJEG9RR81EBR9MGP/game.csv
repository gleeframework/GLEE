"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to make one last offer of $15,000. It's my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's still fair considering the value of the product. Let me know your decision.",15000.0,Alice,5,
