"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers, but it also shows I value the product and am not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  I'm going to reject it and counter-offer in the next round. I still have time to negotiate and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. It's a smaller decrease from my last offer, showing that I'm not willing to drop my price too much further. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. With only four rounds remaining, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum and allows me to close the deal quickly."
