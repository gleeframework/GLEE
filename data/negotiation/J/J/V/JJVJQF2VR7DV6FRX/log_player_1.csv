Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $11,000, I can get at least $12,000 from John. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is just too low for me. How about $13,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and it saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
