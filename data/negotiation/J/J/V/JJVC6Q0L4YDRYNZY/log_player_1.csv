Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,100,000 creates a sense of value and leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, moving closer to the desired $1,200,000 mark.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Knowing John will purchase at $1,200,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims for the highest possible profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and our secured alternative."
