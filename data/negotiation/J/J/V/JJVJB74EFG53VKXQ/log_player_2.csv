"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a great price, as I have another offer for $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and perceived value by mentioning another offer and inflating the worth to you. You can likely get a better price by rejecting and seeing if she'll come down.  If not, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
