"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $925000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're still a bit away from my target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $900000. I'm offering you $920000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900000. I'm thinking of $915000 is a bit too high, but I'm willing to meet you at $915000 is not the best for me, I'll go with $912000. Can you consider that?",912000.0,Bob,6,
