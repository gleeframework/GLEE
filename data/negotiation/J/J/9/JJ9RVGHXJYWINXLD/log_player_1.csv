{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to secure a higher price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, which would be $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $8,500 is closer to my initial offer and represents a good compromise.  It's also significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
