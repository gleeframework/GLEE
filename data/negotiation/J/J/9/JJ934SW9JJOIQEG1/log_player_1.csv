"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's well below its true market value.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think $10,000 would be a fair price for the product considering its value. Please let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can do better, especially since he acknowledged the product's true value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $10,500? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I believe $10,200 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price of $11,500, it's unlikely Bob will budge further.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit within the remaining rounds and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
