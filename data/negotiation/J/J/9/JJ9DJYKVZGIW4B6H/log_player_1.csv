"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe the value it brings will far exceed the price. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and could lead to Bob increasing his offer.

While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm choosing to continue with Bob as there's a chance of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still allows for a profitable margin for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Mid-Point Approach:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my initial offer and halfway between his offer. This signals flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and the potential for mutual profit.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have 6 rounds left, providing more opportunities to negotiate.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and potentially push him closer to my desired price.

Selling to John would be a safe option, but there's still a chance of getting a better price with Bob, making it worthwhile to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 remains significantly below the product's real value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final concession, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm presenting this as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Slight Adjustment:** While still above my minimum acceptable price, I'm making a small concession to show flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair for both parties to encourage Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards accepting my offer, while still maintaining a price above my minimum target. If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I've reached the 6th round. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of his offer remaining stagnant or even decreasing further. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome with John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

Given the limited rounds remaining and the potential for further price reductions, it's more prudent to secure the guaranteed deal with John."
