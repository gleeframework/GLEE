,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $19,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",19000.0,Bob,4,
