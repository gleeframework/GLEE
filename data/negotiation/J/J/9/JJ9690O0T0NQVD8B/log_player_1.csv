"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation, considering the product is worth $80 to Bob.  It also sets a positive tone by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $100 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $115 for the product. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'll reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject this offer and keep negotiating.  I have a backup option in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than what I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting close to an agreement. Let's split the difference and go with $109 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your persistence. I am willing to pay $108 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not yielding significant gains.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to him for $150.  It's a better deal for me than accepting Bob's current offer."
