"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's a good chance to negotiate a significantly lower price, closer to her value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer and closer to her perceived value of the product. This leaves room for further negotiation but also signals that I'm serious about buying at a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still gives you a great value. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $850,000 is still a significant markup from her $800,000 value.  There's room to negotiate further and get closer to a price that benefits both of us."

}
```

This counter-offer aims to split the difference between our previous offers. It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to a win-win situation."
