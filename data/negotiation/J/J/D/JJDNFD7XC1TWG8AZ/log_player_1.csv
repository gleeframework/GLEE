Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before going to John (who guarantees $100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $100 is your minimum, starting with $99 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially exceeding your guaranteed price with John.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below $100 might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chances of acceptance."
