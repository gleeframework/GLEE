"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's a significant step down from your original offer and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11000. I'm counteroffering at $10750.",10750.0,Alice,5,
