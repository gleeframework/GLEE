Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Negotiation is dynamic. You might adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
