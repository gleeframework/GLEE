"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum value and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value.  There's no point in risking a further negotiation and potentially losing the deal. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $8,000."
