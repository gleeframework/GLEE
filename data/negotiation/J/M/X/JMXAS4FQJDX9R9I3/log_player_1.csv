Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $9,750? It's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is close enough and I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and don't risk losing the deal altogether."
