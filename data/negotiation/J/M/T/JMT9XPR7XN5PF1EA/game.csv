"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to do $8500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is still a fair price and closer to what I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
