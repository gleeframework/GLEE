"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair starting point considering its potential, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,100,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
