Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $10,000. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round, or else I'll consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 still isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,200.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10200}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where I'm very close to my minimum price, but I'm not confident that I'll be able to get any higher with Bob.  While I'm not thrilled with selling to John for only $10,000, it's a secure deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
