"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, the price is a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $15,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your feedback, I would like to counter your offer with a price of $10,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering both the value of the product and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
