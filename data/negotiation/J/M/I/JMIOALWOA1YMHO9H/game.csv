"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product for $9500. I think this is a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $9000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product for $9250. This is my final offer.",9250.0,Alice,5,
