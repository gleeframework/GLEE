{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's wiggle room to increase the price if needed. 
* **Is above your minimum:** You've stated your minimum is $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **Shows you're serious about selling:** By offering a price, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price and message based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you initially offered. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to offer $10,500. Can we do business at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just a bit below your initial counteroffer of $11,000. This means that you're close to reaching a deal and it's likely that if you reject, he won't increase his offer further.  Selling to John for $8,000 is less profitable. So, accepting Bob's offer for $10,500 is the best option in this scenario."
