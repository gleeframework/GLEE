"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a significant discount, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate. It also leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to accept a price too low for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob can continue to negotiate to try and reach a price closer to his $8,500 counteroffer.  While there's a risk that Alice could keep rejecting offers and Bob might have to buy from John, there's also a chance Alice will accept a counteroffer in the next round, saving Bob more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.  $8,750 is still a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. It also avoids appearing too stubborn and could encourage Alice to accept the offer."
