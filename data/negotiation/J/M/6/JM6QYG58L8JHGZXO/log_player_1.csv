"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This is to maximize my potential profit while giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a higher price. There are still rounds left, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit higher than what Bob is offering.  I believe this is a fair counteroffer, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to continue negotiating for a higher price, we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. This offer from Bob is within my acceptable range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
