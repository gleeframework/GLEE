"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm suggesting a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her value of $800,000."
