"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a price that's lower than its worth to you, and I get a strong return on my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us - you'll make a profit, and I'll get a great product at a price that works for me.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This still leaves you with a great deal, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
