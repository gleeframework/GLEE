Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is below your minimum of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It shows good faith:** By offering a price that is not your absolute maximum, it shows you're open to negotiation and willing to compromise. 

This strategy aims to maximize your chances of getting a good price while keeping the negotiation open and engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go as low as $8,000.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still unable to meet at $9,000. I would like to propose $8,500 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I believe I can still get a better deal by counter-offering one last time before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're still not able to go higher, I'll have to accept your previous offer of $8,500, but I'd prefer to find a solution that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 8750}
