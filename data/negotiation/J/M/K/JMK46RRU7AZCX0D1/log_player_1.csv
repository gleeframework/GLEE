"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great asset for you. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a slow climb to reach a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is a better use of my time and ensures I get a fair price for the product."
