"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10,500 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
