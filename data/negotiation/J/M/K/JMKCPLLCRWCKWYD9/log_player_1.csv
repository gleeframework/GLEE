Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Its value to you is undeniable. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. How about a price of $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value ($1,800,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Scarcity and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the product's exclusivity and your confidence in reaching a deal subtly implies Bob might lose out if he refuses.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob is likely to counter, and you can gradually decrease your asking price while aiming to stay well above your $1,000,000 floor. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even initially reject your proposal.  The key is to engage in a negotiation that leads to a mutually beneficial outcome, ideally closer to your initial asking price."
