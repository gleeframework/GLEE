"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not asking for the full value I believe the product has, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping for something closer to $100. I understand the value of the product might be different for you, but I'm looking for a price around $100. Let me know if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **I want to explore further:** Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my desired range.  
* **The risk of selling to John is low:**  Since I can still sell to John for $120, I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's try to work something out!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within my range:** I'm proposing a price that's above my minimum ($120) but lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. Considering the product's value, I would like to propose $120 as my offer. I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $120 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale.
* **No upside to rejecting:**  While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll get it, and I'm risking losing the sale altogether.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even if I reject Bob's offer, I still have the option to sell to John for the same price.  There's no need to take a gamble."
