"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $16,000 is still a little higher than what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
