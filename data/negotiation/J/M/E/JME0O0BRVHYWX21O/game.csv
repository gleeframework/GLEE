"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the benefit it will bring.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering it's still above your value and gives us both room to profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident the value this product brings justifies a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,120,000?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,120,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,085,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",1085000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I want to find a price that works for us both, that offer is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a good compromise that keeps us both in the black, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
