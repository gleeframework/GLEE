"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.  I think it's a fair price considering the benefit it will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While there's a chance Alice might drop the price in subsequent rounds, it's better to start the negotiation with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering it's still above your value and gives us both room to profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident the value this product brings justifies a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,120,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reduced the price slightly, but it's still too high. Bob wants to save as much as possible and should continue to negotiate.  There's still room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,120,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,085,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I want to find a price that works for us both, that offer is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his target.  He has room to negotiate further and should aim for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $1,050,000.  There's a good chance Alice will concede further in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a good compromise that keeps us both in the black, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
