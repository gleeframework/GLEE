Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential value of the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering it's still above your value and gives us both room to profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
