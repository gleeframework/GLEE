Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $11,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for you.  This starting point aims to capture the majority of the potential surplus value (the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum).

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, starting with a strong offer that is still within a reasonable range for Bob is the best strategy to maximize your potential profit."
