"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get the product for less than $900,000.  It's too early in the negotiation to commit to that price, especially with the alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is a good price, Bob should still try to get a better deal. He's only 3 rounds in and knows Alice is willing to negotiate. He can likely get closer to his desired price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer.  The risk of buying from John is still present, but this offer is too high at this stage of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to offer $860,000.  This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to an agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a price of $880,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, and the risk of buying from John for $1,000,000 is becoming more pressing. Alice's offer of $880,000 is only $20,000 above Bob's last offer and is a good deal considering his target price of $1,000,000.  It's a good time to lock in a solid price, especially as there are only 5 rounds left.  Further negotiation may not lead to a significantly better price, and Bob could risk missing out on a good deal altogether."
