"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This would give you a good profit, and I would get a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's finalize this deal and move on.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us - you get a good deal, and I can still make this work.  Let's try to finalize this deal and move on.",13000.0,Bob,6,
