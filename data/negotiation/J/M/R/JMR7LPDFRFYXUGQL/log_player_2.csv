"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to work towards a deal that's better for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Starting with a lower price gives you more room to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $12,000 is still a significant profit for Alice, as it's above her value of $15,000. 
* **Opening the Dialogue:** This counteroffer opens a dialogue and encourages Alice to consider your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This would give you a good profit, and I would get a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
