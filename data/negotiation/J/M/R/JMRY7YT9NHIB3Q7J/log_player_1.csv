"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While I appreciate your offer, $80 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $88?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $85 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer $88, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. $85 is a fair price, and I'm happy with that outcome."
