"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1500000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1350000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1420000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a fair price for me.",1420000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1375000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1375000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1375000 and $1420000, which would be $1397500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1397500.0,Alice,5,
