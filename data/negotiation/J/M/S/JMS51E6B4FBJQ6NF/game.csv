"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for this product. This still leaves a good profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a good profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer you $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
