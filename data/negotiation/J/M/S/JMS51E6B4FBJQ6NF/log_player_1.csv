This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals your willingness to compromise while still ensuring a good profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for this product. This still leaves a good profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a good profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer you $1,300,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. Although I'm getting closer, the difference is still significant, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation. John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so I'll take his offer."
