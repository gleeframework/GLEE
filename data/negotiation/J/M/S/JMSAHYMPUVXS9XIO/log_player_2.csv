Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to meet you at $7,850, Bob. However, I'm willing to get closer to your target price. I'll offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $8,100 is a reasonable deal. It's much closer to her perceived value ($8,000) than your maximum ($10,000).  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and risk her ending the negotiation."
