"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a little bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be open to $7,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and land on $7,850?",7850.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to meet you at $7,850, Bob. However, I'm willing to get closer to your target price. I'll offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
