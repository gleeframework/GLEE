Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response. Remember, I can always fall back to John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
