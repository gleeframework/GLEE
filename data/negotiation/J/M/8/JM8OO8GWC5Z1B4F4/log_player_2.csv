You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since you're willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. You can buy from John and secure the product immediately."
