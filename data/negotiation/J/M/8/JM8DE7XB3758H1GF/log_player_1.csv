Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation if needed. It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe there's room for negotiation. I will make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price reductions and wasted time is too high.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 guarantees my minimum and allows me to move on."
