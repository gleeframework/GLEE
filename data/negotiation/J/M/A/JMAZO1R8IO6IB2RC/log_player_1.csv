Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible without going below her own minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Alternative Secured:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at her minimum price, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
