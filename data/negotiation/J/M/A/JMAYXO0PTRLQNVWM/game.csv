"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider $850000? This is a fair price that still allows you to profit while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $875000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smoother transaction.  Let me know what you think.",875000.0,Alice,3,
