"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. You can likely get a better price, and you have 9 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to come to an agreement that works for both parties. Our counteroffer is $13,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still better off trying to negotiate a lower price. You've already established a range of acceptable prices (between $12,000 and $14,000), so continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $12,500.  I really want this product and am confident we can find a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your willingness to negotiate further. Considering your latest proposal, we are pleased to offer $12,750 for the product. We hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's very close to your last counteroffer, and you have a few rounds left to negotiate. Accepting this offer is a good move. You've saved $2,250 compared to buying from John, and you have more rounds to potentially negotiate a lower price if you're not satisfied with the final deal."
