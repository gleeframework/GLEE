"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While the product seems valuable, my budget for it is significantly lower than your asking price. Would you be open to negotiating a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I understand you need to profit, and I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $7,500 for the product? This price point aligns better with my budget while acknowledging the value of what you're offering.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about the value I bring to the table. How about we discuss a price of $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,5,
