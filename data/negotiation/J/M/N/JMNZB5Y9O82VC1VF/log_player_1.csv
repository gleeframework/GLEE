{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of such high caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum ($1,000,000).
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to be more confident in her pricing with Bob.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he's willing to pay beyond his maximum value.  In a real-world scenario, gathering more information about the buyer would be crucial for optimizing the offer."
