"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. While I recognize the product's worth, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to start. To make this deal work, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price still leaves a healthy profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still leaves room for profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
