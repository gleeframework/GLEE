{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  It's a significant discount from John's price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows for potential savings.**  You might be able to get Alice to drop her price further.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to decide on a counteroffer.  Consider how much lower you're comfortable going and how likely you think Alice is to accept a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant discount:** This counteroffer represents a 10% discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a serious intent to purchase.
* **Reasonable starting point:**  $800,000 is still a good price for you, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she rejects, you can adjust your next counteroffer based on her reaction."

* **Significant Savings:**  You've saved $150,000 compared to John's offer.
