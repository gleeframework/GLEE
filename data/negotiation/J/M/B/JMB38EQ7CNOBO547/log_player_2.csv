"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also cheaper than buying from John. Even though Alice uses some sales tactics in her message, the price is a good deal."
