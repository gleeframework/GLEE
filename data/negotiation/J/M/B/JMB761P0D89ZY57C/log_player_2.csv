"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's a significant difference between her offer and your maximum, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is a bold move, but it's a tactic to see if Alice is truly motivated to sell. If she rejects this, we can adjust our counteroffers upwards in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to $5,000 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This is a more moderate approach than the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,200 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to accept it yet.  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but I believe we can still reach a price closer to $5,500.  I'll reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher price, hoping to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only slightly. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's most recent one.  The hope is that Alice will accept this offer, as it's not too far from her previous offer and still within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd still like to see a lower price, Alice's offer of $6,300 is getting close to my acceptable range. It's also likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly lower price. It's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product than risk losing it and having to pay John's price."
