"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $11,500 from John.  It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't accept $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is a good deal for Bob. It's still cheaper than buying from John for $12,000, and it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money and gets him the product."
