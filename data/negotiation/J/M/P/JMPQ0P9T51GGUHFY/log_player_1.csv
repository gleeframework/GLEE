Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value ($150) increases the likelihood of him accepting while still generating a significant profit for you. 

* **$130** is a compelling price for Bob, saving him $20, while you earn $30 more than your minimum acceptable price."
