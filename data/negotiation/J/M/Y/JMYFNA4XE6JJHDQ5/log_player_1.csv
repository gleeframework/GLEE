Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is worth a lot to you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We're getting close to my minimum, and further haggling might not be productive.  It's better to take the $140 and avoid the risk of Bob walking away."
