Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it does indicate he's interested in buying the product. This allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a compromise. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which gives me leverage in negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum but still allows for negotiation. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  The counteroffer is still higher than Bob's initial offer, suggesting that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **""Meet Halfway"" Approach:**  Phrasing the counteroffer as a compromise can make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **John as Backup:**  The security of John's offer gives me the confidence to push for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not able to go above $10,000 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between our prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which makes Bob's offer unattractive.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there's a possibility he might be willing to pay more if I push back. 

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to get closer to my minimum price or, if unsuccessful, will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and  ""Meet Halfway"" Approach:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still pushing for a price that's closer to my minimum. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and highlights my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value and Fairness:**  I emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of my proposed price to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet, keeping open the possibility of further negotiation or selling to John."
