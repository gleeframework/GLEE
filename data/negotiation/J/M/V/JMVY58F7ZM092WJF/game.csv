,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not able to go above $10,000 for this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between our prices?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",11000.0,Alice,5,
