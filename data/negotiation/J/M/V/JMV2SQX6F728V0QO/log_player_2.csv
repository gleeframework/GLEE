"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than what Alice likely considers a reasonable price. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value and potential of this product, I could come down to $1,325,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit significantly.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,325,000 is still more than you want to pay.  You're aiming for a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to keep negotiating and potentially get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,262,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1262500}
