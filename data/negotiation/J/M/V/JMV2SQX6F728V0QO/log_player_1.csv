"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation at a high point.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While my minimum is $1,000,000, starting lower would limit potential gains. This price allows for negotiation while still being significantly above my baseline.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps me understand how eager Bob is to buy and how flexible he might be in his counteroffers. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's quite interested in the product. By rejecting and counteroffering, I can aim for a price closer to $1,300,000. It's a calculated risk, but I'm willing to take it at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the true value and potential of this product, I could come down to $1,325,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit significantly.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer, but not drastically. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and make it clear I'm not simply dropping the price for the sake of it.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive, pushing towards a price point where I'd be very satisfied with the deal. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but still have room to maneuver if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,262,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,262,500 is a very good price, significantly above my $1,000,000 minimum and a substantial profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob is clearly using a midpoint strategy, and this offer represents a fair compromise in the negotiation.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Dragging the negotiation out further might not yield much more, and a sure thing now is generally better than the risk of holding out for a slightly higher price later. 
* **John as a Backstop:** While I could theoretically push Bob further, the difference in potential gain is not worth the risk of him walking away. I'm confident I'm getting a great deal, especially since I have John as a guaranteed backup option."
