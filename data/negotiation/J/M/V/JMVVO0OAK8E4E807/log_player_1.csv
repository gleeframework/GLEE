Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $17,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that?

You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his final offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely he'll move much higher than $12,000. John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum, so it makes more sense to proceed with him."
