Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to spend and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
