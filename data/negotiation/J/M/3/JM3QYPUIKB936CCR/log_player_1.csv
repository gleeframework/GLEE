"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe could significantly benefit you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Urgency (Subtle):**  Mentioning a ""unique opportunity"" hints at potential competition without being overly aggressive.

This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation close to Bob's maximum valuation while gauging his willingness to pay a premium.  It allows me to adjust my approach based on his response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to maximize profit, but accepting $1,050,000 at this stage would leave a substantial amount of potential value on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the still-high price.
* **Compromise:** By positioning the new price as a ""compromise,"" I'm encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my target.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
