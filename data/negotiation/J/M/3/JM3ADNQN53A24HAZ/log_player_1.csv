{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you still make a profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** This can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to accept.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can use the information from his counteroffer to adjust your strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your desired price point. You're not desperate to sell, and John is willing to pay your minimum.  It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
