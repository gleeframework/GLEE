"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is better than $100, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to lower the price further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for your counteroffer, as it's below Alice's value of $80 and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is a better price than $100, it's still higher than the $85 you offered. Since Alice rejected your offer, it shows she is willing to negotiate further.  You should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Explanation:**

You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate, and she's met you halfway by dropping to $90. Now you're offering a slightly higher price than your previous offer, but still below Alice's value. This signals that you're serious about buying but also that you're willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet your needs."
