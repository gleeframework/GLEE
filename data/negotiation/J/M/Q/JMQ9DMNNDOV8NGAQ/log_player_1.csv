Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially get a higher price, but you are also ready to walk away if Bob is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $120 is better than selling to John, you can likely do better than that.  Bob's offer is within your range, but it's still low. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That still leaves you with a great value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
