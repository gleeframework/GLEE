"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny! What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. Could you consider $8,750? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still just a bit too low. How about we split the difference again and go with $8,875? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's the absolute maximum I can offer. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,6,
