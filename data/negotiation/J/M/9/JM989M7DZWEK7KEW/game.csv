"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price.  While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. This is a significant product with a lot of value to offer, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
