Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I know it's worth a lot to you. My starting price is $900,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price.  I want to try and squeeze a bit more out of the deal before considering John's offer. There are still six rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my asking price.  While I'm open to further negotiation, I'm still not comfortable going below $825,000. This is a significant product with a lot of value to offer, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect your need to get a fair price. Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a good deal for me, considering my minimum goal was met.  It's also important to note that I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject this offer, I risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's offer, which is the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer secures the deal and ensures I get my desired price."
