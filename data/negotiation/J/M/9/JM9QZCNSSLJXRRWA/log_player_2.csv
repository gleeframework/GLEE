"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600000. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a good starting point, $600,000 is still significantly more than what you're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate. There's room for Alice to lower her price, and you can counteroffer strategically. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Buying from John immediately means paying full price. It's better to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I see the value in it, $600,000 is above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for the product. This price reflects its market value and allows for a fair profit for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Justified Offer:**  The message explains your reasoning for the lower price, appealing to a fair market value and profit for Alice.
* **Openness to Collaboration:**  The message emphasizes the desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, keeping the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $550000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this price is a fair middle ground, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Alice has moved from $600,000 to $550,000, a considerable reduction.
* **Fair Middle Ground:** Alice's message suggests she's willing to compromise, and $550,000 is a reasonable middle ground between your last offer and hers.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** While you could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice could become less flexible or even walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal with a limited risk.
* **Avoiding John's Price:** Buying from John at $800,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's offer."
