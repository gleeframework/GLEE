"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I've done some research and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still leaves some room for both of us to feel like we got a good deal. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $102.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $108. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. It's a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced it's worth $108. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If I can't get it for $105, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $100.",105.0,Bob,6,
