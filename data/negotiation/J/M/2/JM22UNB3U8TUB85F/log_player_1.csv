Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $15,000 might discourage Bob. This price point is competitive while still ensuring a significant profit margin.
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John if Bob declines."
