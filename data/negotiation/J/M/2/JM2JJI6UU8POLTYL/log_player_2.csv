Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the benefits you'll get from the product.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has come down from her initial offer and is now at $6,000, which is a good price. It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more back and forth and could even cause Alice to withdraw her offer completely.  Accepting $6,000 saves Bob $2,000 compared to buying from John."
