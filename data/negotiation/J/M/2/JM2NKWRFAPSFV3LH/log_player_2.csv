"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth $10,000 to you, right?  I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but it's still above what the product is worth to you. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above what the product is worth to her. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Alice some incentive to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good deal for me. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially causing the price to go up again is too high.  It's also possible that I'll end up paying John $10,000.  $9,000 is a better price than either of those options."
