"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $115. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $115 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $125? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",125.0,Alice,5,
