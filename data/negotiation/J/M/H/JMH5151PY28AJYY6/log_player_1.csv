Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for bargaining. It also acknowledges Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is a decent offer, I can likely do better. Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $117.50? "", ""product_price"": 117.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $117.50 is closer but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my ideal price and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a lower price or even a rejection. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price significantly higher than John's offer."
