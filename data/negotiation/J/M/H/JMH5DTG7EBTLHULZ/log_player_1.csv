"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still below what I know the product is worth to Bob. This should incentivize him to negotiate, but leaves room for me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much.  How about $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 
 
 I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to my desired outcome, but still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe that I can get a better price. I will reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800 as a final compromise. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in closing this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
``` 

I'm  offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I think there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can reach a more favorable price. I still have time and options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200 as a final compromise.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in closing this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, hoping this is enough to get him to accept.  It's a significant drop from my previous offer, showing I'm flexible and committed to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I have very few rounds left. With only 2 rounds left, the chance of getting a better offer is low, and the risk of ending up with no deal is high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, so that's the safest option at this point."
