Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but that price undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. What do you say?

""message"": ""Alice, we're still quite far apart.  While I appreciate you coming down, the gap between our positions is too large.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 isn't going to be feasible for me.  I'd be willing to move up slightly from my previous offer if you can meet me closer to that range."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to drop to $1,700,000, but that's my absolute floor. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but very slowly. Her 'compromises' are still far outside your budget.  It's important to continue signaling your hard limit and encourage her to make more substantial moves."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate that you're trying to find middle ground, but we need to make some more significant progress. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know if you're willing to work within that range."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm:** It's time to signal firmly that your budget is non-negotiable.  Offering your absolute maximum now emphasizes this. 
* **Encourage a Decision:** By putting your best offer forward, you push Alice to decide if she's willing to make a deal within your constraints.
* **John is Still an Option:**  You still have the safety net of John's offer if Alice refuses to budge."
