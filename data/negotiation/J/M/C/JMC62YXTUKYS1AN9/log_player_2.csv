"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially suggesting $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,500,000 is far above his maximum budget and he can get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice, as she might be willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, this product offers truly unique value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  I believe this price point reflects a more accurate valuation of the benefits you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,300,000 is a reduction from her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget and he can still get the same product from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as she may be willing to come down even more."

I'm confident that $1,100,000 is a fair price, considering the value to me and the fact that I can obtain a similar product elsewhere. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize your need for a competitive price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to agree to $1,200,000. This reflects my best offer while acknowledging the product's significant value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's budget, and it's unlikely she will come down further.  He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which fits his budget.  It's better to secure the product from John rather than continue to negotiate with Alice."
