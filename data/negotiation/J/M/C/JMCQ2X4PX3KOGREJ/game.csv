"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,500,000. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
