"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,500,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. How about $1,250,000?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $950,000 offer. Accepting his counteroffer would mean losing out on a potential $50,000 profit.  It's strategically wiser to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
