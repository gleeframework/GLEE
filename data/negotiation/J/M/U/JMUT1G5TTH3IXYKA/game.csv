"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $88. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep this conversation going!",88.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $88 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference at $86?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $86 is still a little too low for me. How about $87?  That's a small step closer to my ideal price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?",87.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $87 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $86.50?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me.  Let's find a way to make this work!",86.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal, and $86.50 is closer than before. However, I'm still aiming for $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this work!",87.0,Alice,7,
