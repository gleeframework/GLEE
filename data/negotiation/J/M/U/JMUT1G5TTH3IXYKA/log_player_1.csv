Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $88. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep this conversation going!"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $88 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we split the difference at $86?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $86 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite happy with it. I'm going to try to push for a higher price with my next counteroffer. I still have plenty of rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but $86 is still a little too low for me. How about $87?  That's a small step closer to my ideal price, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $87 is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $86.50?  It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference to me.  Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $86.50 is pretty close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, and see if I can get him to budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal, and $86.50 is closer than before. However, I'm still aiming for $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 87}
