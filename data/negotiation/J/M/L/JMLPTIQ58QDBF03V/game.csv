"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1500000, but I'm not willing to budge further. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be realistic about the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1350000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet on price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think I'd be better off selling to John at $1500000. That being said, I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $1300000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
