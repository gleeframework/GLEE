"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'm thinking of $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $112, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $108?",108.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent price for the product. I can do $115, but that's really as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",115.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous counteroffer. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already met you at $110 in a previous round. I'm not willing to revisit that price. I'm willing to make one more small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $112.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",112.5,Alice,9,

"I understand that you've already met me at $110 before, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $109. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the offer. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $150.",109.0,Bob,10,
