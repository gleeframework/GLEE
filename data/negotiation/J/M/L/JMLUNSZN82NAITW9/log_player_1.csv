"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get as much as possible.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and optimistic tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob emphasizes its worth and encourages him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I have 8 rounds left to negotiate. There's still a chance to reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is always a viable option, but I'm not giving up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go any lower than $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reinforcing the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards accepting my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and cooperative tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I'd love to make a deal, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Acceptable:**  $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred more, it's a reasonable offer considering the negotiation so far.
* **Avoiding Further Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to more rejections and further delays, risking the possibility of losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and move on to other opportunities.

I'm happy with this outcome, even though it's not my ideal price. It's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product and avoid further potential losses."
