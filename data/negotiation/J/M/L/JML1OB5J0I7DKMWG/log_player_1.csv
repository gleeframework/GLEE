Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that."
