"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $12,500 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11,750. Can you consider that?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but I'm still not quite there. How about $12,250? That's a fair compromise, and it's still above my minimum. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I can do $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
