"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move forward, I could consider $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working to reach a deal.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,850,000.  This price reflects the true value of this unique product and its potential for return.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
