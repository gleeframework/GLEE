"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  I'm confident this price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $850,000.  Would you consider $900,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit off. How about we settle on $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
