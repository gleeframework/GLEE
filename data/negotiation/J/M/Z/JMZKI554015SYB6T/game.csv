"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, recognizing the value you see in the product.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion if needed.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1000000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",950000.0,Bob,4,
