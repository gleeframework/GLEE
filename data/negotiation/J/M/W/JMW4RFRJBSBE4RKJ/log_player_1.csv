Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $8,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob still has a potential profit of $3,000.
* **It shows you're willing to be flexible:**  You're not starting at the highest possible price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Reasoning:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** The message emphasizes the good deal Bob is still getting, making it more likely he'll accept. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
