Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the value of the product can encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  Using ""Let me know what you think"" shows I'm open to counteroffers and willing to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below my target.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $13,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by counter-offering.
* **Compromising:** $13,500 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Keeping the conversation open:**  ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" keeps the negotiation going and shows I'm willing to find common ground. 
* **Maintaining a safety net:** I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my expenses within a specific limit. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has returned to his original offer of $13,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $13,500. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiations could drag on, and I'm already close to my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000,  which is better than risking further negotiation with Bob. 

It's a tough choice, but selling to John is the most efficient option to maximize my earnings."
