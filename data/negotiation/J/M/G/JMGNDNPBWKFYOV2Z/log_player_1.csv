"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in the product, I think $14,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and his perceived value. There's room for negotiation.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to do $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a bit higher.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?"", ""product_price"": 11750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks again. I'm ready to make this work, but $11,750 is pushing it a bit too far.  How about we land at $11,200? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a good deal, and he's getting close to my fallback option with John. 

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting at $11,200 is still a profit, and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or losing the sale altogether."
