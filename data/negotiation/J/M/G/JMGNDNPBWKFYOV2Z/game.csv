"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see the value in the product, I think $14,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks again. I'm ready to make this work, but $11,750 is pushing it a bit too far.  How about we land at $11,200? That's a fair compromise.",11200.0,Bob,6,
