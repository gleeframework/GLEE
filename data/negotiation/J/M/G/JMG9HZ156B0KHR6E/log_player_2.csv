"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product, leaving room for negotiation. Buying from John for $15,000 would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, but slowly.  There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counteroffer aims for a price point slightly above Alice's known value while staying well below John's offer and our initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable price, but we're still not at a point where accepting is better than a potential deal with John. Let's counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing the value in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $10,250? That's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 10250
}
```

We're inching closer to Alice's value while staying conscious of the $15,000 alternative. This offer keeps the negotiation moving while applying subtle pressure that time is a factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now getting very close to her value. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase below John's $15,000 price, making it the most logical decision at this stage."
