"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway just yet. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $13500. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
