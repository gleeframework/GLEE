(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget. It's more beneficial to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's already indicated he's willing to pay $10,000 from John. This counteroffer sets a firm limit and puts the pressure on Alice to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. He can try to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to $10,000.  He has several rounds left and doesn't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $10,000 to $12,000, showing flexibility while still aiming for a significant discount. This counteroffer shows Alice he's serious about buying, but also that he won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still willing to hold out for a better price. He's only $4,500 away from his target price with several rounds remaining. There's still room to negotiate further, and he's not in a hurry to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small increase in his offer, demonstrating that he's serious about buying but still wants a price closer to his target. This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to meet Alice halfway while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price. At this point, Alice's offer of $14,000 is within $4,000 of his ideal price and only $1,000 more than his last counteroffer.  With limited rounds remaining, accepting the offer seems like the best strategy.  It's a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and provides a good deal for Bob.  There's a high risk that Alice might not budge further, and Bob might end up paying more if he rejects the offer again."
