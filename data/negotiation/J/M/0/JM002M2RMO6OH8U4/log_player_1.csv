Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is closer to my value of $10,000 than Bob's value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob feel more inclined to negotiate.
* **Open to counteroffers:** The message implies I'm open to counteroffers, which encourages Bob to participate. 

This offer strikes a balance between maximizing my potential profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my bottom line ($10,000),  it's still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm not just rejecting Bob's offer outright.  I'm proposing a counter-offer that's a compromise,  and I'm providing a reason why it's fair (splitting the difference).
* **Maintaining a friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly to keep the negotiation positive.
* **Still leaving room for further negotiation:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, $9,000 is still above my bottom line of $10,000. This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made two counteroffers and I'm not confident I can get much closer to my desired price.  

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $10,000, it's more beneficial for me to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
