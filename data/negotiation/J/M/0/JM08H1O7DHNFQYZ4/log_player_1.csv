Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit. It also opens the door for a counteroffer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay a maximum of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. I want to see if I can push Bob further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000.  The product is worth significantly more to me than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a substantial discount.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable paying $950,000. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you place on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $920,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  I can get a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, which is a much safer and more profitable option at this point."
