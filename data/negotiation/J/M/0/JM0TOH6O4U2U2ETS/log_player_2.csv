"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely do better than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Alice is clearly willing to go lower than her original offer, so rejecting again allows for more back-and-forth and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still leaves room for a compromise.  This should put us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I'd prefer a lower number,  it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
