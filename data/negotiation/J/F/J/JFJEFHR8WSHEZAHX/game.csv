"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $110. I'm willing to come down to $125, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can meet you at $115, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered it to you for $130 and $125, and you've rejected both times. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. However, I'll give you one last chance. I'll sell it to you for $135, and that's my final offer. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'll meet you halfway between $125 and $130, which is $127.50. Can you accept that?",127.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I think $127.50 is a bit too close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $127.50 and $135, which is $131.25. That's my final offer. Take it or leave it.",131.25,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $131.25. I think I've made it clear that my maximum budget is $125, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at that price. I'm willing to make one last offer: $125. If you can accept that, I'll buy the product. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",125.0,Bob,10,
