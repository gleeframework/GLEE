"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum price and still offers you a good value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable, but also assertive. He acknowledges Alice's offer while highlighting that it's still too high for him. By offering $12,500, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise but also setting a firm boundary. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while staying within Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $12500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $13500, which reflects a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate further. He can still potentially get a better deal from Alice, or he can choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about getting this product. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again showing a willingness to compromise by increasing his offer, but he's still staying firm within his budget. The message also subtly hints at the possibility of going to John, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.  This counteroffer strikes a balance between being reasonable and pushing for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  I'm willing to accept $13250 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise given your previous offer and my minimum requirements. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, so rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy.  Bob can either try to get Alice closer to his desired price or  look at buying from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering our previous offers and the value of the product to both of us. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 12750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for a price that's as close to his budget as possible while still offering a price that's reasonable for both parties. He's also using a strong closing tactic by saying it's his final offer. This adds pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but $12750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is a compromise we can both live with. This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's clear that further negotiations are unlikely to result in a price Bob is comfortable with. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and saves him the time and effort of further negotiation."
