"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price. However, $14000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $12500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $13500, which reflects a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers. Let me know your decision.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about getting this product. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider my other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to pay $12750 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering our previous offers and the value of the product to both of us. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",12750.0,Bob,6,
