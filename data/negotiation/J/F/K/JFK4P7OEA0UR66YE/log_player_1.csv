Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it aims to set the bar high and potentially get Bob to quickly counter with a more reasonable price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 at any time, so I'm not afraid to risk losing this deal if Bob isn't willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more than $800,000, Bob's offer is already my minimum acceptable price. I'm not sure how much he values the product, but I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle with John for the same amount."
