It's clear Alice's offer is way too high.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm starting with a price that's close to my maximum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This should show Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I won't overpay."

While $9,500 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to push for a better deal. I'll reject and see if Alice will budge further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice that I'm serious, but still keeping it under my maximum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still prefer a lower price, Alice has come down significantly.  $9,200 is within my budget, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get the product without having to resort to buying from John."
