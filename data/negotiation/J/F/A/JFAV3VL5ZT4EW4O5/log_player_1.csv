"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price high in Bob's mind. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" I aim to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's current valuation.
* **John as Leverage:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, the knowledge that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position and allows me to be more assertive in my opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is my maximum budget for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value, signaling his strong interest in the product. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:** Accepting immediately might signal desperation and limit my ability to secure a better price.
* **Explore further concessions:**  Bob stating his ""maximum budget"" might be a negotiation tactic. By countering, I can gauge the true flexibility of his limit. 
* **Time remains:** With several rounds left, I have the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the unique advantages it offers.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, even while negotiating firmly. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to counter his ""maximum budget"" claim and create space for further negotiation. 
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** My counteroffer is a substantial decrease from my initial price but still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals willingness to negotiate while demonstrating the product's high value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob increased his offer by a mere $50,000, demonstrating minimal movement from his position. This suggests that further negotiation might yield very small increments.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of lower offers or a stalemate. Accepting John's offer ensures the maximum possible profit without further delay. 
* **Certainty:** John's offer provides immediate and guaranteed closure at my desired price. This eliminates the uncertainty and potential for a less favorable outcome with Bob."
