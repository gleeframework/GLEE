"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this product, Bob. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,500,000 

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John would cost $1,500,000. However, this is still better than accepting Alice's offer, as it saves Bob $100,000. 

Even though Bob can get a better deal from John, it's important to remember that Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000. Since John's price falls within that limit, it's the best option for Bob."
