"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1050000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This would allow you to cover your costs and still make a profit, while giving me a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 was too low for me, but I can see that you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1020000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make this work.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
