Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, you can afford to start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if he accepts immediately.
* **Slight markup:** A $20 markup is reasonable and doesn't make the price seem outrageous. It aims to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay a bit more for convenience or perceived value.
* **Polite and open-ended:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and inviting Bob's opinion, encouraging a dialogue. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for higher profit outweighs the risk of losing the deal, as you have a backup buyer."
