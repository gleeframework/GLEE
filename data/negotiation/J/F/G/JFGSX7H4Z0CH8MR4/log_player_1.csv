Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price is still lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Protecting My Interest:** If Bob rejects, I can either negotiate further or take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  How about $9,000?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up with a lower offer. 
* **Time is Money:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale quickly, allowing me to move on to other opportunities.

**Note:** While I could potentially get a higher price, accepting $9,000 is a solid outcome that minimizes risk and avoids the potential for a prolonged negotiation."
