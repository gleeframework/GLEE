"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. Given the value I'm seeking, I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to consider my own needs, and $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a fair price that I think we can both be comfortable with. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $17,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price that accounts for the value I'm seeking and allows for some room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to make a profit, and $15,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise a bit further. I'm counteroffering at $16,250. This price takes into account the value you're seeking, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
