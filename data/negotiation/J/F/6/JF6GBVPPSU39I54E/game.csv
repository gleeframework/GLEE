"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to get it for a lower price.  How about $140?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $180. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
