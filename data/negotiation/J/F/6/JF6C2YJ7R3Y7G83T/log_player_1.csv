Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept but maximizes your profit.  Here's a possible approach:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below your guaranteed price to leave room for negotiation if needed.
2. **Justification:**  It can be helpful to provide a reason for the price (even if vague) to make it seem less arbitrary.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  The $1,450,000 offer anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's ""unique value,"" potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Room for Negotiation:** You've left some space to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates, while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance, you might adjust your approach."
