Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  $95 gives Bob a small discount (from his perceived value of $80) while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By saying ""special price"" you subtly imply this offer might not last, potentially nudging Bob to act."
