"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is $12,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price, aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering it's significantly less than your asking price and still allows you to make a profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is closer to his target price, he can still attempt to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,500 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This price is a fair compromise, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is a good deal, Bob is very close to his budget limit.  He's likely to have a difficult time negotiating further with Alice.  To ensure he doesn't spend more than his target, it's best for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This decision guarantees he stays within his budget."
