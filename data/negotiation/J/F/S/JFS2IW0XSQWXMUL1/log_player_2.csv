"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is within my budget, I'm aiming to save as much as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to do $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
