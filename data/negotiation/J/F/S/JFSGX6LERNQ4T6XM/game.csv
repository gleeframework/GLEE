"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $115. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $110. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $112.50. It's a small adjustment, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
