Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm going to start by offering Bob the product at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves no room for negotiation on my end, but it gives Bob a chance to accept the deal if it's within his budget. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and my options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is still a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round. I'll still keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between his offer and my initial price. It still provides a decent profit for me, but also allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low. It's clear we are too far apart in our valuations.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,000,000. It's my minimum price, and it guarantees me the best possible outcome."
