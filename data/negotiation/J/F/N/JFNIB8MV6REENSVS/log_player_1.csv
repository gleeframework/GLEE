"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great value for you, considering what this product is worth to you.  Let's find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted by John's offer, $1,000,000 is too low. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my minimum price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but $1,000,000 is still far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as a final compromise. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've only got 4 rounds left, and it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that satisfies my minimum value.  John's offer guarantees me my desired price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
