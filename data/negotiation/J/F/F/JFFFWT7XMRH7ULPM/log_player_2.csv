"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is showing some flexibility, she's unlikely to reach my target price. I've set a firm budget, and going over it isn't worth the potential savings at this point. John offers a sure thing at my maximum price."
