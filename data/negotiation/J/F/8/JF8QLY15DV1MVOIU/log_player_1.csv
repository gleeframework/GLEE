Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also gives a clear message about why the price is justified. This approach aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $1,150,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Encourage negotiation:** This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer or use John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it's still significantly lower than the value of the product to me. It's in my best interest to keep negotiating and try to get closer to my target price of $1,150,000. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that hopefully will lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value I'm providing, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it also holds firm on my desire for a price closer to the product's value.
* **Justification:** I emphasize the product's value and present $1,100,000 as a fair compromise.
* **Clear Goal:**  My counteroffer aims to reach a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's initial counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position."
