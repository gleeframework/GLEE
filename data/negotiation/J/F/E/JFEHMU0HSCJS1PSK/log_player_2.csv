Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do better. I can offer you the product for $102. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is within our acceptable range. It's better to secure the deal now at $102 rather than risk the negotiation going nowhere and having to pay John $120."
