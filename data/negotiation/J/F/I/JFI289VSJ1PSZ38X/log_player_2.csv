"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the potential benefits it holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate, but I need to ensure a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high, though it's getting closer. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end, and I want to be straightforward. While I'm invested in finding a mutually beneficial agreement,  $850,000 is simply too far off from what I can accept.  To be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer who sees the full value at my asking price.  However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,300,000. This leaves a significant gap for you to profit while ensuring the product's value is acknowledged.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is trying to pressure me, but I'm not giving in yet. Her final offer is still too high, but I'm close to my limit.  One more counteroffer is worth a shot."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
