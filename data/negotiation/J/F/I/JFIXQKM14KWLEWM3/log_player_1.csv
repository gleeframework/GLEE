Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,999,999."",
""product_price"": 1999999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob.  
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer gauges Bob's eagerness and potential to pay a premium. The near $2 million price tag is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob shows interest but balks at the initial figure.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value is much higher than even Bob's perceived $1,000,000 valuation, aiming to justify the high asking price.

**Important Note:**  This is a risky strategy. There's a chance Bob will outright reject the offer, and you'll end up with the $1,000,000 from John. However, the potential upside of securing a much higher price from Bob makes it a gamble worth considering."
