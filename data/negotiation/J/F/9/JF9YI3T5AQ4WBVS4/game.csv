"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $750,000?  This still leaves room for you to get a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, $725,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to achieve. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product at $737,500.  This is a fair price that gives us both a win.",737500.0,Alice,5,
