"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $11,500. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a price of $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
