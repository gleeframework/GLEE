"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum of $800,000, it's significantly below the value I'm aiming for. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000 to reflect your budget constraints.  This price still offers you a substantial gain while allowing me to recoup a reasonable amount.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above my minimum threshold of $800,000, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiation complications or the need to sell to John."
