Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. However, it's important to consider that this might be too high and risk losing Bob. I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get as much as possible, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows a willingness to compromise. It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price, especially considering John is willing to pay more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer to Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can convince Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the negotiations with Bob seem to be dragging on.  I've already made several concessions and Bob is still not willing to meet me halfway.  John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to sell to John to avoid any further delays or potential losses."
