"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a fair compromise. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere.",13000.0,Bob,6,
