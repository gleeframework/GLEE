I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price, so there's no real risk in offering a higher price."
