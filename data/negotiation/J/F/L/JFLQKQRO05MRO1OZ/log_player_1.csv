Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm leaving the door open for a counteroffer, as I understand this might be a negotiation. 
* **Plan B:** I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to be mindful of my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting this would be a huge loss. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he expressed interest and willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a counteroffer that might be more agreeable.
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000, which gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value while still acknowledging his budget constraints.
* **Positive Tone:**  Again, I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** This price still allows for some wiggle room if Bob makes another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $6,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value and I'm unlikely to get a higher offer from Bob.
* **Negotiation is becoming tedious:** Bob's repeated low offers indicate that we might be stuck in a loop of counteroffers, wasting time and energy.
* **Time is money:** It's more efficient to sell to John now and secure a guaranteed $12,000. My time is valuable, and I don't want to risk further negotiation delays.

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, I'm happy to have a guaranteed sale with John. This decision prioritizes efficiency and financial stability."
