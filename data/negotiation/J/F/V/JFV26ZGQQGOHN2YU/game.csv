"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal!",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,700? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. How about $8,650?  It's a small compromise from both of us, and it might be a good way to make this deal happen.",8650.0,Bob,6,
