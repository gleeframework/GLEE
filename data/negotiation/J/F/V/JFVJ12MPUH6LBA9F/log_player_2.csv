"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,400,000. He's willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice values the product at $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start making counteroffers and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position. Alice has moved closer to his desired price, but there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I see your point about the value, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. To reach a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,325,000. This price is fair considering our previous negotiations and reflects the value you've expressed for the product."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm counteroffering at $1,375,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is very close to Bob's desired price range.  It's only $50,000 more than his last counteroffer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only five rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the chance of securing a significantly lower price is diminishing. Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within his budget and avoids the potential of a more expensive alternative."
