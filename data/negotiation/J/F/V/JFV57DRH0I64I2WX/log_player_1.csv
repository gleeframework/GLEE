Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to reach a mutually beneficial price closer to Bob's valuation of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum price of $80. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $82.50? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $82.50 is just above my minimum price of $80, and it seems like he's being reasonable. I'll accept his offer to ensure the sale and avoid risking losing the deal by further negotiation."
