"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I know it would be a valuable asset to your operations.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you value the product highly.
* **Close to Bob's Valuation:** Aiming close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him accepting immediately, securing a significant profit for you.
* **Confident Justification:**  The message frames the price as justified due to the product's inherent value, subtly anchoring the negotiation at a high point.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? I think that's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, it's still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value and our initial offer.  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows us to counter with a price closer to our target. We are early in the negotiation process and have room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential. To meet you halfway, I can offer it for $1,030,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1030000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from $1,100,000 to $1,030,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The new price is still substantially above Bob's offer and closer to our desired range.
* **Justifying the Value:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, subtly anchoring the negotiation above $1,000,000.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between securing a good deal and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the effort. While $1,030,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $950,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. However, $950,000 is still a significant distance from our last offer and undervalues the product. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000. We are not in a hurry and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect your approach to negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,000,000 even? This price acknowledges the product's value while recognizing your willingness to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:**  We've come down to a round number ($1,000,000), signaling our willingness to find a compromise. 
* **Strong Position:** This price is still a significant profit margin for us and a strong position to hold.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting this is a solution that ""works for both of us,"" we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept.

This offer aims to be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still meeting our target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $970,000?  I think that's a fair offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $970,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding our minimum by a large margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could continue negotiating, the potential gains are becoming smaller with each round. It's unlikely Bob will suddenly agree to $1,000,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away, leaving us with John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a very good deal and minimizes that risk. 

This acceptance point reflects a practical approach, balancing potential profit against the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
