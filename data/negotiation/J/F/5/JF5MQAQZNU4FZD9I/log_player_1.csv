{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is lower than Bob's maximum of $150, so there's room for negotiation if he wants to buy it. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** A $10 difference between your offer and your minimum is a fair starting point for negotiation. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to Bob's maximum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
