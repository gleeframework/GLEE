Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $730,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $730,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's ideal price point.  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away or getting stuck with a higher price from John. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal for a potential $20,000 saving."
