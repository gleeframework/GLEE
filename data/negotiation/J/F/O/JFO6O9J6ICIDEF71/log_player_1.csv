Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to aim high with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, it makes a counteroffer around $1,500,000 seem more reasonable.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value but avoids being overly specific. This allows Bob to potentially justify a higher price in his own mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's particularly averse to high initial offers, a more moderate approach might be better.
* **Relationship Building:** While maximizing profit is the goal, consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is desirable. A slightly less aggressive offer could be beneficial in the long run."
