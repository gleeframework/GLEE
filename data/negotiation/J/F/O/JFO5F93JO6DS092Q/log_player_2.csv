The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer of $12,000 is too high. It's better to reject and see if he can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

The product is still worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, so Alice's offer of $10,000 is still too high. It is worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."

Let's try to meet in the middle. This offer is still below Bob's maximum value, but it shows a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, it's time to take the safer route and buy the product from John for $8,000."
