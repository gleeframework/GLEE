Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $170. I believe it offers significant value, but let me know if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with an offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $170, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he rejects this initial offer, he might be more amenable to a slightly lower counter-offer that's still above your minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John gives you leverage. You don't *need* to sell to Bob at a loss. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $120, he might not be willing to pay that much.  His willingness to pay could be influenced by factors like budget constraints or perceived alternatives.
* **Negotiation Style:** This initial offer assumes you're comfortable with a potentially back-and-forth negotiation. If you prefer a quicker, no-haggle approach, you could offer a price closer to $120."
