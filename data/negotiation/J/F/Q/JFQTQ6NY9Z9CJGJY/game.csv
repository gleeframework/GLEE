"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $10,500. How about $9,800? I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I really need this product.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. My minimum acceptable price is $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go any lower. Remember, I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to go with them. Let me know your final decision.",11500.0,Alice,5,
