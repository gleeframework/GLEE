"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $1800000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1550000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming up to $1550000. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1580000.  This price is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the product's value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to be flexible.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
