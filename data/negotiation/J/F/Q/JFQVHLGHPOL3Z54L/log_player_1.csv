I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to be ambitious in the initial offer, as I can always lower it later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still seeking a price closer to my initial value."
