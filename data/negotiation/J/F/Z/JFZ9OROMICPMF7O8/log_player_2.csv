"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows my serious intent to negotiate.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,250,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. I want to continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still room for improvement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and hopefully, a better starting point for further negotiations.  I'm trying to find a price point that Alice might be willing to accept, but still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,225,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept.  I've already shown Alice I'm willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to lower the price further. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,175,000}
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer again to $1,175,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to go much higher than this.  Hopefully, this is close enough to her desired price that she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Alice's offer again. While $1,200,000 is a good price, we've already been through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm confident that we can reach a price closer to my desired target of $1,175,000.  I'm not yet ready to give up and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,185,000}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $1,185,000. This is a compromise, but it's the most I'm willing to pay. I've shown Alice I'm serious about buying, and I'm hopeful that she'll accept.  If she rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John in the next round."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000

Alice has come down significantly in price. I'm close to my target and only have one round left. It's a good deal for both of us."
