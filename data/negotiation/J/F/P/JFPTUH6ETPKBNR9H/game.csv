"Thank you for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $16000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really only able to offer $13000. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm hoping we can agree on $13500. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",14000.0,Alice,7,
