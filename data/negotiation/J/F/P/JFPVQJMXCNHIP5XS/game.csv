"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a good deal, and I respect that. However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $975,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
