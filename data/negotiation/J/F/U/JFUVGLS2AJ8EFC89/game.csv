"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To move forward, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the original asking price, while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. ",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $10,900 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still maintains a good profit margin for us. I hope this revised proposal works for you.",10900.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,900 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm happy to pay $10,600, which is closer to my target price. This represents a fair compromise and will allow us to move forward with the deal. What do you say?",10600.0,Bob,6,
