Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,500. Accepting this offer is the best option because:

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not finding a better deal is increasing.  
* **Fair Compromise:** The offer represents a fair compromise, allowing both parties to achieve their desired outcome."
