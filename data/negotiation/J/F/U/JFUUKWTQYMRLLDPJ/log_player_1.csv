"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum, but it's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested. I'm hoping to strike a deal without going too many rounds, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $10000. This aligns more closely with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least be at $11,000 to make this work for me.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and am willing to consider $10800 as a fair price for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low. I am willing to go lower than my initial minimum, but I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with something closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm prepared to drop my price to $11,200. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10900 for your product. I hope this meets in the middle of our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,900 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with something in between our current positions.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might not be able to reach an agreement. Let's split the difference.  How about $11,050? I think this price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11050}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. Considering the value of your product, I would like to propose a final offer of $10950. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are nearing the end of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are not getting any higher. I'm running out of time, and I am not comfortable settling for a price this low.  I've lowered my minimum price several times, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal.  I am going to sell the product to John for $12,000."
