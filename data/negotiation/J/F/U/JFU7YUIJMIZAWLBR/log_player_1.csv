Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000? That's my maximum budget, and I'm confident we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
