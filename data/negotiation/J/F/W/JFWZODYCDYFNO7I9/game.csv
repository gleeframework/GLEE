"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20000. It's a real steal! I believe you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a price closer to $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10000 is too far below the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still being attractive to you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still quite a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15500. This price is closer to the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here.  $15500 is still too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13000.  It's a fair compromise, and I really believe this product is worth it to me. Let's close the deal!",13000.0,Bob,6,
