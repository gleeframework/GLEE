Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20,000. It's a real steal! I believe you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000, as I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  This will hopefully pique Bob's interest and encourage him to negotiate.  I'm also using a positive and persuasive message to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in the product but would need to see a price closer to $10000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is too far below the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still being attractive to you."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher offer. I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still quite a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500. This price is closer to the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair here.  $15500 is still too high.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13000.  It's a fair compromise, and I really believe this product is worth it to me. Let's close the deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been adamant about his $13,000 offer. I've already lowered my price significantly and am at risk of losing too much money if I continue to negotiate. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk Bob getting any more stubborn. It's time to move on and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
