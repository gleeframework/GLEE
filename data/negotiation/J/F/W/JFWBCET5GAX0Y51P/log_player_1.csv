Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the value to Bob, the message hints at it to pique his interest.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your absolute minimum price. 
* There's a risk Bob might be turned off by the high initial price. However, since the product has equal value to him, there's a good chance he'll consider it."
