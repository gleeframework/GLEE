"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12,000. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,500? That's a significant move on my part.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a price of $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
