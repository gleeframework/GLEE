"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $85, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $95. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $90. While I was hoping for a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum of $100 and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might lose the deal with Bob altogether and have to settle for $100 with John. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close it."
