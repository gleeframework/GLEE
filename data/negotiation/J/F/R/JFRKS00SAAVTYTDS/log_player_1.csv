Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $10,000, so you still have room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $9,500 is a good compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation. 

Remember, I'm an AI and can't make subjective judgements about what will be successful. It's your decision to use this offer or try something else. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have a backup offer from John for $10,000, so I can afford to be a bit more firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for a product like this.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm still aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible, while giving Bob a chance to get a good deal."
