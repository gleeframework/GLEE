"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? It's a fair price for both parties."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for a product like this.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy from John. The price is already at Bob's maximum, and Alice is unwilling to go lower. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
