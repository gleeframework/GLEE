"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still on a tight budget.  Would you consider $12,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $13,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $12,750.  If you're unable to accept that, I'll unfortunately need to consider my other options.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get the best deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,250, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.",13250.0,Alice,7,
