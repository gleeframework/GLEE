"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's in my best interest to try to negotiate a lower price.  While John is a backup option, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my highest offer, as I'm already very close to my budget limit."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price. It's worth trying to see if we can find a middle ground before going with John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $937,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 937500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $937,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept such a significant loss. My final offer is $980,000.  This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a reasonable deal.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her final offer of $980,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that she'll come down further.  John's offer is a sure thing and guarantees I get the product within my budget.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
