"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  How about $11,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can do $11,500.  That's a significant step from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a profit, and $11,500 is getting closer but not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting frustrating. We both know this product is worth around $12,000. Let's just agree on $12,000 and be done with it. This back and forth is a waste of both our time.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12,000. However, I've already had an offer from John to buy the product for $12,000, and I'm not sure if I want to wait any longer to close the deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll need to consider selling to John.",13250.0,Alice,9,
