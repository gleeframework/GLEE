"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite high. How about meeting halfway at $11,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point."
