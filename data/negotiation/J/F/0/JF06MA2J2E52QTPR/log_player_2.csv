"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $120 to you. I am willing to sell it to you for $110. This is my best offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $110. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. This is my best offer for this round."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We're starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value ($100) than our own ($120).
* **Room for Movement:** $105 still leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that's agreeable to both of us.
* **Maintaining a Position:** It's important to show that we're serious about getting a good deal, but we're also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal. I am willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is my best offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high:** While her price is lower, it's still above your ideal price point of $105.
* **More negotiation needed:** You have several rounds left, so it's worthwhile to try to get Alice closer to your price.
* **Avoiding John:**  You're still saving money by negotiating with Alice, so it's not necessary to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $108 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $106.50. This is my final offer for this round."", ""product_price"": 106.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're now splitting the difference between our last offer ($105) and Alice's current offer ($108). 
* **Reaching Agreement:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to be flexible and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're moving closer to the middle ground, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Bob. After considering your last offer, I am willing to sell the product to you for $107. This is my final offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** Alice's offer of $107 is very close to your desired price of $105, and it's significantly lower than the $120 you'd pay John. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  If you reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice will either raise her price in the next round or become less willing to negotiate.
* **Time is running out:** You've already had four rounds of negotiation, and there are only five rounds left. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk a worse outcome later."
