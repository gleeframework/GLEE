"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $25000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your offer. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for this product. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $18000. This offers a significant discount from my initial offer and provides a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the $18000 offer, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $15000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",15000.0,Bob,4,
