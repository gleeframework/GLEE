"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $25,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 25000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your offer. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $10000 for this product. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's too early to sell to John at $15,000, as there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I will counteroffer to explore a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $18,000. This offers a significant discount from my initial offer and provides a fair value for both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the $18000 offer, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $15000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us, and there's no reason to risk losing the sale by rejecting the offer. I'd rather close the deal now than potentially go through more negotiation rounds and risk ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John at a lower price than what Bob is offering."
