"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $16,000?  This would still give you a great value, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $14,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth and my willingness to compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to $15,000. How about $14,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's try to close this deal. ",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider my offer and let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
