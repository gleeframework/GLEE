"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make at least $160 to make it worth my while. How about we try $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  How about $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $140. How about we meet in the middle again, at $152.50? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",152.5,Alice,5,
