"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 was a bit steep for you, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $850,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
