"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still within my budget and is a better price than buying from John for $150.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower price. Accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
