"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is great, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me.  I'm getting closer to being able to meet your price, but $13,500 is still a stretch. How about $11,500? This is my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,7,
