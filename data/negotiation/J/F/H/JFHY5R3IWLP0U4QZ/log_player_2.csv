"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is a significant amount above the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value ($8,000) as possible.  
* **Counteroffer:**  $9,500 is a substantial decrease from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.  
* **Room for compromise:**  This offer leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** While $13,000 is lower than her original price, it's still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **Jhon's price:** Buying from Jhon for $15,000 is a last resort.  Bob wants to avoid this if possible.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Continuing the negotiation gives Bob a chance to further lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's concession:** Alice lowered her price, showing she's willing to compromise.
* **Middle ground:** Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Maintain pressure:**  This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal but isn't making an unreasonable demand."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** Alice's offer remains too high for Bob, as he wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Jhon's price:**  While buying from Jhon is a last resort, it's still a better price than Alice's current offer.
* **Continuing negotiation:**  Bob has 5 rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price.  He's likely to get a better price by continuing to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's stubbornness:** Alice has remained stuck around $13,000, not showing much willingness to lower her price.
* **Closing the gap:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 moves him closer to the middle ground while still keeping some pressure on Alice.
* **Time is running out:**  Bob is approaching the halfway point of his rounds, so he needs to push harder to get a deal.  This offer is bold but not unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** While Alice has lowered her price, $14,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's aiming for a price closer to $11,000 or lower.
* **Jhon's price:**  Jhon's price is a real threat, but Bob still has time to negotiate a better deal with Alice.
* **Negotiation is key:** Bob has 3 rounds left.  While time is getting tight, he can likely get a lower price by making another counteroffer. It's a risk, but the potential reward is worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  Bob has only 2 rounds left.  He needs to make a bold move to close the deal. 
* **Alice's resistance:**  Alice is showing a pattern of resisting lower offers.  A slightly higher offer might convince her to budge.
* **Compromise but with pressure:** This offer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, but it keeps the pressure on Alice to accept.

If Alice rejects this, Bob has a tough decision in the next round. He'll have to weigh whether to accept her final offer (if it's reasonable) or take the safe option of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $14,500 is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible.
* **Time is running out:** This is the last round before he has to buy from Jhon. There's no time to negotiate further.
* **Jhon's price:**  While Jhon's price is not ideal, it's the most sensible option at this point. Bob doesn't have enough time to risk getting a worse deal from Alice.

While Bob would prefer to get a lower price, it's more important to ensure he actually gets the product.  Buying from Jhon guarantees him the product while still staying within his budget."
