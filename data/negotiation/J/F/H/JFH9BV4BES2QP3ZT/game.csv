"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, a price that reflects its potential. I'm confident this product can be incredibly beneficial for your business.  Let's discuss further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the pricing. While $800000 is a fair market value for similar products, this particular product offers unique features and potential that justify a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm open to discussing further, but I need to see some more flexibility on your part.",850000.0,Bob,4,
