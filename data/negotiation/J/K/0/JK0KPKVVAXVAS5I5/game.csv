"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $11,500. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I can do $12,100, but I'm afraid that's as high as I can go.",12100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $12,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $12,100. How about $12,300?",12300.0,Alice,7,
