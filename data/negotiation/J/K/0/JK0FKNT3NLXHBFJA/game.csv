"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves you a good margin to work with, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $800,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
