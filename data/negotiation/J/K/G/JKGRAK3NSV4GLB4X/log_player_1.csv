Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a price higher than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The price is lower than Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential bargaining.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher price might scare Bob off immediately.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and Bob's perceived value.  I believe I can get closer to $14,500 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a good price for Bob as it's below his perceived value, but it's also closer to my ideal price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better.  I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a good compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my final counteroffer and significantly higher than my minimum. At this point, continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a sale and ensure I earn a good profit."
