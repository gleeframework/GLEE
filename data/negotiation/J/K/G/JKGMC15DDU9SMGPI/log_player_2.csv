"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product!  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1400000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your target price of $1,500,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds and the ability to buy from John as a fallback option, so there's room to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a significant investment on my end and hopefully, we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you, while also enabling me to reach my target price.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above the $1,300,000 you offered.  You have 7 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially make a counteroffer closer to your ideal price point and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident the product will be very valuable to me, but I need to be within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our objectives.  Let's settle this deal so we can both move forward."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
