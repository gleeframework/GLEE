Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product!  I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1300000. This represents a significant investment on my end and hopefully, we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to what I believe I can achieve with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you, while also enabling me to reach my target price.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident the product will be very valuable to me, but I need to be within my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1325000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our objectives.  Let's settle this deal so we can both move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to my target price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John would result in a lower profit. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a decent profit and avoid further negotiation."
