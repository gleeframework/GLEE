Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you justifies a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from what I would receive elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me. I believe I can negotiate a higher price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John right now would guarantee a profit, but I'm willing to risk it for a potentially better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget is limited, but this product is truly valuable and worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1250000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below the value I would receive from selling to John. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can achieve a higher price. Selling to John would be the safe option, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can secure a more profitable deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I am willing to pay $1300000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will help us reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, and it's getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with.  While selling to John would net me a higher profit, I'm concerned about losing out on the potential for a higher price in the remaining rounds.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is becoming more significant. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the possibility of a lost deal."
