"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you justifies a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $1400000. This is a significant discount from what I would receive elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget is limited, but this product is truly valuable and worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This represents a significant discount for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1250000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1250000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great deal. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
