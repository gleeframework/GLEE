# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $140.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get a bit more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

$135 is a good price, and you're still saving $15 compared to buying from John.  It's worth closing the deal now."
