"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That gives us both a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
