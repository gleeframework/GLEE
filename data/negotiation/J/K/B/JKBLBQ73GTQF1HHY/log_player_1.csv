Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth further negotiation or if I'm better off selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to secure a sale, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but it's still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  Given that John is offering my desired price, I'm going to take the guaranteed sale and move on.  The risk of continued negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential for a lower price."
