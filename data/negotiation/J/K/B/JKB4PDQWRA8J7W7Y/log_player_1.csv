"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that its benefits will far outweigh the cost for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,300,000, we're setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob counters significantly lower, the negotiation will likely revolve around a figure higher than his initial valuation of $800,000.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message exudes confidence in the product's value, reinforcing the justification for the high asking price. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After careful evaluation, I believe a fair price would be $950,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. We have room to negotiate, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good fallback option, so we'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls a bit short of what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that. How about we meet in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** We've acknowledged Bob's offer and made a counter-concession by lowering our price from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000. However, we're still significantly above his offer and maintaining a position above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Framing:**  By saying ""meet in the middle,"" we're subtly encouraging Bob to make a more substantial move towards our price point. 
* **Maintaining Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price we're asking.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while pushing for a higher final sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but given the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I believe $1,000,000 is a fair price. Let's aim for a compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a good deal for us."
