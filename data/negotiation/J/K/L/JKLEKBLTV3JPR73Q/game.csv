"Alice,  your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about we split the difference and settle at $1175000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $1175000 to meet my minimum threshold. How about we meet at $1250000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still hesitant at $1250000.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This would be a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
