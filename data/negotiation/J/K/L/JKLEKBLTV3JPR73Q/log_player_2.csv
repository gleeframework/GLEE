(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  your offer is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1350000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $1175000 to meet my minimum threshold. How about we meet at $1250000? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He should not buy from John yet, as there is still a possibility of getting a better deal from Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still hesitant at $1,250,000.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This would be a significant saving for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
