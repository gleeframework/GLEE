It's too early to tell if $8,500 is a good deal.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, hoping to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $7,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500

Alice is coming down in price, which is a good sign.  Let's see if we can get closer to my target price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7250}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $7,250. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, and we've already gone through several rounds.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of going back and forth further. I can still save a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
