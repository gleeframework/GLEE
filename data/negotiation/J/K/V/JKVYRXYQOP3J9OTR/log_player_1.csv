"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its market value.  I could consider a price of $1,000,000 for a quick sale."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $700,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further.  Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Would you be willing to agree on $750,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  While he's negotiating, the increments are getting smaller, and it's not worth the risk of him walking away or continuing to lowball.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
