"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique and warrants a price that reflects its potential. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to $900,000. How about we meet at $1,150,000? I believe that's a fair and reasonable offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  Let's try $1,075,000. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
