Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but at a very slow pace. It seems unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than John's $1,000,000 offer within the remaining rounds.  It's strategically wiser to cut our losses, take John's guaranteed offer, and avoid potentially losing more time in a negotiation that might not yield a significantly better outcome."
