"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $12,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $12,500? This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",12000.0,Bob,6,
