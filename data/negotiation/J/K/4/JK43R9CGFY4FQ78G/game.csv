"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10500? This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's still below your estimated value and above my minimum. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10500 is a bit too high. How about $9500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $9500 is closer, it's still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference, how about $10000? This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's right at my minimum and still within your budget. I believe it's a good compromise that allows us to both walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $10000. How about $9200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9200.0,Bob,6,
