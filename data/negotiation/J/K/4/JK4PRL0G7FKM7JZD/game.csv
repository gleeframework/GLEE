"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If you're serious about selling, let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $110. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still above my budget. I'm really looking for a deal that's closer to $95. How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $102.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $102.50, which would be $106.25. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",106.25,Alice,7,
