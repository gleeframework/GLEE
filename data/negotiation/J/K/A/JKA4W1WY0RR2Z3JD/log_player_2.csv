Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value and quality. I'm confident you'll love it.

Bob can still save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer.  While $11,000 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $10,900. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down to $10,900, which is within his budget and a good deal considering John is selling the product for $12,000.  Further negotiation might save him a few hundred dollars, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
