"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you working with me. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value and quality. I'm confident you'll love it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  This would be a good price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $10,900. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,
