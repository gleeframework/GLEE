"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation.  It's in Bob's best interest to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's work together to get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He wants to save as much money as possible and should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise that's fair to both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, $1,050,000 still falls a bit short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's within his budget, and he's already come down to his lowest offer of $1,050,000.  Continuing to negotiate could risk the deal entirely, and buying from John would cost significantly more.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action."
