"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $13,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its true worth. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.
