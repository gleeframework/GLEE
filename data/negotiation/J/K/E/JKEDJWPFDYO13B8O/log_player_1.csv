Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale of $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage. You should aim to get as close to $12,000 from Bob as possible. There's no reason to go lower since John provides a safety net.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,900.  I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point.  Let me know if you're interested, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 11900}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Price, But Justified:**  Starting high gives you room to negotiate. You're just below your guarantee, maximizing potential profit.
* **Sense of Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject this offer. However, remember you lose nothing by trying. If he rejects it, you simply move on to John and secure your $12,000."
