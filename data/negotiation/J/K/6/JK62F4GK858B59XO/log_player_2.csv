Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a good price considering the value of the product, and it gives you plenty of room to profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm firm on my $1,000,000 offer. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll make a significant return on your investment. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm on $1,000,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's not worth the risk of exceeding your $800,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
