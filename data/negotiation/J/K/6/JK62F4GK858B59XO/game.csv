"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $600,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 simply isn't enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a good price considering the value of the product, and it gives you plenty of room to profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm firm on my $1,000,000 offer. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident you'll make a significant return on your investment. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
