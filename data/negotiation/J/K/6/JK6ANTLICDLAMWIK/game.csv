"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing with this negotiation. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  How about we compromise at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would that be feasible?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $11,500 is really pushing it. This is a great deal on a high-value product. I can go as low as $14,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
