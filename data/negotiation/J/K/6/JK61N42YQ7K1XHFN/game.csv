"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is pushing the lower bounds of what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I propose $800,000 as my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
