"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is pushing the lower bounds of what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I propose $800,000 as my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has met your limit and it's unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer prevents potentially missing out on the product altogether."
