"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just too low. How about $105?  That gives us both a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're coming up on your offer.  I'm feeling $100 is a fair price that will give us both a good deal.  How about we close it out there?",100.0,Alice,5,
