Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Bob is clearly playing hardball and I'm getting nervous. He's mentioned John, and it seems like he's willing to walk away.  I'm running out of time, and I can't afford to risk losing this sale.  

I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's a sure thing, and it's much closer to my desired price."
