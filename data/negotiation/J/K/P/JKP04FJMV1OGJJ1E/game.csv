"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,800.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,800 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,400, which is a compromise between our previous offers.",10400.0,Alice,5,
