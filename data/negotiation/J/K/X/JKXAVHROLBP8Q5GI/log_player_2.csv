{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.

* **Room for Compromise:** There's still room for Alice to come down a bit, and I'm prepared for a back-and-forth.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is up.**  This is the last round of negotiations, and I've made my best efforts to get a lower price.
* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While closer to my target, it's still not an ideal price.
* **Avoiding a potential stalemate.** If I reject this offer, there's a strong chance Alice will reject my counteroffer as well. This would leave me with no product.
* **John's offer is a guarantee.**  While it's more expensive, it ensures I get the product and doesn't risk further negotiation. 

Given the limited time and the uncertainty of Alice's willingness to compromise further, buying from John is the safest and most practical option."
