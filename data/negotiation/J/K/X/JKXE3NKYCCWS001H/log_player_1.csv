Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a good price, but I'm looking to get it for a little less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your asking price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
