"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,250,000 is well above my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value and my maximum buying limit, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Considering the product's true value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised price reflects the significant ROI you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
