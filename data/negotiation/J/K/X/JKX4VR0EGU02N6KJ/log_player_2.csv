Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $680,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

This seems like the right time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Good Deal:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has come down significantly from her initial offer. $700,000 is a significant savings compared to your $1,500,000 alternative with John. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away from the deal.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. Accepting a good offer now has value compared to potentially small gains with additional back and forth."
