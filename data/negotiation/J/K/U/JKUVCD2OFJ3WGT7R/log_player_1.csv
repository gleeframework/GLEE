"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $60 is way too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more than what I was hoping for."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than $60, it's still too far below my minimum price of $120. I'll counteroffer again, trying to push the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this work, but $75 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute best offer is $78.  If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Bob is not going to meet my minimum price. While $78 is better than his previous offers, it's still far from my goal. With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk going lower and getting stuck with a bad deal.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I get a fair price."
