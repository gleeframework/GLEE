"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more than what I was hoping for.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to make this work, but $75 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  My absolute best offer is $78.  If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",78.0,Bob,6,
