"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating my price target. 
* **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to get the price as close to my $80 maximum as possible, but I'm aiming lower initially to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $85 is within my $80 budget. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge, and I'd end up paying $80 with John anyway. Accepting now secures a good deal."
