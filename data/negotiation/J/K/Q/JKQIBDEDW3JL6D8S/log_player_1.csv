Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
