"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000.  That's getting closer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'll take $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,5,
