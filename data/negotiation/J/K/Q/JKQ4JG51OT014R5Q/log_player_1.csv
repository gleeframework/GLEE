Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $10,000.
* **Negotiation space:** I'm leaving room for negotiation and aiming for a price that's closer to Bob's value while still exceeding my minimum.
* **John's offer:** I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm trying to maximize my profit by negotiating with Bob first. 

This offer provides a good balance between maximizing my profit and leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can then sell to John for $10,000, guaranteeing me a profit."
