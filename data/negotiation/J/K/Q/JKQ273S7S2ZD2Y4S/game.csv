"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  This is my maximum, as I have another seller willing to provide the product at that price. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go to $900000. This is a fair compromise for both of us and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
