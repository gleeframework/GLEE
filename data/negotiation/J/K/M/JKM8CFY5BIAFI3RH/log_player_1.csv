"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and potentially lead to a more favorable final agreement. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. This allows you to gradually decrease the price while gauging Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value to make the offer more appealing. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate, and there's a chance to reach a price closer to your target.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is your safety net, but it's too early to use it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While that price is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move closer to your range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?  This reflects the true value of this product and its potential for your business."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're moving significantly closer to Bob's offer (from $2,200,000 to $1,850,000), demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, you are still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""meeting in the middle,"" you frame the counteroffer as a fair compromise, even though it's still heavily weighted in your favor.
* **Value Emphasis:**  You reiterate the product's value to reinforce the idea that your asking price is justified. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining pressure on Bob to increase his offer substantially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $1,525,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to push for more in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures you a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John at your minimum."
