"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $117.50?",117.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, let's try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $122.50. It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good price for this product. ",122.5,Alice,5,
