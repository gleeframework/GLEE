"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $117.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $117.50 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $120."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
