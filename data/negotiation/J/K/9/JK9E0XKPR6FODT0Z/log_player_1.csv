Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of the product and believe I can secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product.  I believe this counteroffer will be attractive to Bob and lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price."
