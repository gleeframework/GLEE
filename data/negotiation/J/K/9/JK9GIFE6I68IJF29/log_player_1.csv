Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000, which reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it gives Alice a starting point.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, ensuring she doesn't lose money.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
