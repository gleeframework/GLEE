"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a comfortable margin for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $1,000,000 for the product. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while providing you with a substantial value.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
