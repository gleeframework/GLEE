Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible. Starting with a higher price allows for potential negotiation downward.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net.  There's no risk of getting less than this amount.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above that price before it becomes unattractive to him.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How Bob responds will determine the next move. If he outright rejects the offer, a counter-offer closer to $10,000 might be necessary."
