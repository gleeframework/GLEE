"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle around the middle ground at $10,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price. He's moved a bit, but his latest offer is still significantly lower than what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
