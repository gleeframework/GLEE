"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle around the middle ground at $10,000? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However,  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
