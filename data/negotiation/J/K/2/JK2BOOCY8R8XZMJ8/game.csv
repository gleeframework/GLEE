"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I'm confident this price is fair considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $10,750 is closer, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.  Let's make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
