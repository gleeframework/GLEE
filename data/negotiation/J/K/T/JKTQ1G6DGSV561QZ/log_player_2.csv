"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's significantly more than what the product is worth to Bob.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1100000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum acceptable price.  It makes sense to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to come down further.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might get frustrated and walk away. However, the potential reward is a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is still a bit high, I'm prepared to go up to $950,000.  I think this is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $950000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $1025000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  However, it's getting closer to the price Bob is willing to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate. While there is a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, the potential reward is a better price.  Jhon is a backup option, but Bob is still trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I am too.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1000000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1010000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's getting close, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Bob has a backup option with Jhon at $1,000,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.  Given the limited number of rounds left, it's wiser to secure the product from Jhon rather than risk losing the deal with Alice altogether."
