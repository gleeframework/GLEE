"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $7,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,500? It's still a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my minimum desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $8,500. How about we try $7,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle on $8,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum desired price.  Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,900 is still below my minimum desired price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While it's tempting to keep trying, I'm not sure if I can get him to budge much further.  It's safer to accept John's offer and secure $8,000 for the product."
