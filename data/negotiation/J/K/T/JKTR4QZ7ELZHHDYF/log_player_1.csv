Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 initially gives us room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects.  
* **Positive framing:**  The message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes a ""good deal"" to pique Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**  By starting high, we aim to gauge Bob's potential willingness to pay. This strategy allows us to explore a range of prices while keeping in mind our minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
