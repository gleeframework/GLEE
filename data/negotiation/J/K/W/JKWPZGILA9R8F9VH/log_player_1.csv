"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000,  but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see how willing he is to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my initial offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $9,800. This is a slight increase from his offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrating that I value the product higher. I'm hoping this will get us closer to a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600.  While I'd like to get closer to $10,000, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal. $9,600 is a good price and I'm happy to close the deal."
