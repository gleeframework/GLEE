"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit.  I know Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has some room to negotiate upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is the best option.  Let's keep trying with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still well above Bob's last offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, and this price reflects that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While this is getting closer to John's price, I think I can still get a better deal with Bob.  It's worth trying another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price given that Bob's offer is only $500 away from selling to John. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and it's time to see if we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the price is getting too close to John's offer.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  I'm going to sell to John to ensure I secure a sale and a profit."
