"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
