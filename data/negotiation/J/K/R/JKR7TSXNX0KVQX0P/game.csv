"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know the value is high, but I believe it's a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still reflects the value of this unique product. I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product without breaking the bank.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but $1,200,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm offering $1,275,000 as my final offer.  It's a compromise that allows us both to move forward. Let me know your decision. I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1,200,000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from a competitor.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
