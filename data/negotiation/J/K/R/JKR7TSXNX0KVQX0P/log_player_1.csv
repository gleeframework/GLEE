{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know the value is high, but I believe it's a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000, but I want to leave some room for negotiation.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so I'm starting high, leaving a significant gap for negotiation.
* **First offer:**  I'm offering $1,400,000. This is a big enough discount from my minimum to show good faith and make Bob consider the offer seriously.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, but I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me a strong negotiating position.
* **Counteroffer potential:** I can make a counteroffer to Bob, hopefully closer to my desired price range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer and still reflects the value of this unique product. I'm confident that this price is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridge the gap:**  I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  My counteroffer is still above Bob's value, but lower than my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving and maintains leverage.
* **Justify the price:** I'm reinforcing the product's unique value and emphasizing the significant discount from my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is only $300,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me a strong negotiating position.
* **Counteroffer potential:** I can make a counteroffer to Bob, hopefully closer to my desired price range. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** While I'm close to my minimum, selling for $1,200,000 would be a significant loss. 

**I'm going to make one more counteroffer to Bob, hoping to push him a little closer to my desired price point.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but $1,200,000 is still below what I can accept. I'm offering $1,275,000 as my final offer.  It's a compromise that allows us both to move forward. Let me know your decision. I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final offer, showing I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Small compromise:** I'm lowering the price slightly from my previous offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting that this offer allows both of us to benefit from the deal.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1,200,000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from a competitor.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for compromise:**  Bob has repeatedly refused to budge, and his final offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly below my minimum.
* **Risk of losing time and money:**  Further negotiations might lead to more rejections, costing me valuable time. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is the safest and most profitable option.

**It's time to secure the guaranteed profit and move on. I'm going to sell to John.**"
