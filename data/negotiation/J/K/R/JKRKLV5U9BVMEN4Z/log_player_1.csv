Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'd love to sell for $15,000,  I'm willing to negotiate down a bit to secure the sale,  but I won't go lower than $15,000 as that's my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backstop:**  The fact that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence that I can walk away if Bob is unreasonable. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  Selling to John is always an option if the negotiation with Bob fails, but I'll try to get as much as possible from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **""Fair Compromise"" Framing:**  I'm using language that positions my offer as reasonable and a fair meeting point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm still in a good position to negotiate if necessary.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still walk away and sell to John for $15,000. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $9800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me. I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm willing to continue the negotiation, but I won't accept a price that is significantly below my minimum. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** My minimum acceptable price is $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John as a Backstop:** If I fail to get a satisfactory price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that $10,000 is my final offer. This puts pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **""Great Deal"" Framing:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $10,000, he's getting a good value compared to what he's willing to pay.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While $10,000 is lower than my ideal, it's still a significant profit for me. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John.
* **Setting a Deadline:** By calling this my final offer, I'm subtly setting a deadline for Bob to make a decision. This can motivate him to accept."
