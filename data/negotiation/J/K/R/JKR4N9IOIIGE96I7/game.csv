"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, so I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we do $8,500? That would be a fair compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $9,250. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9250.0,Alice,5,
