Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $14,000. I believe it presents a significant value at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible before going to John (our guaranteed $15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While we could start higher, going too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like we're not interested in a deal, pushing him away. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price from Bob and ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leading us to John's guaranteed offer."
