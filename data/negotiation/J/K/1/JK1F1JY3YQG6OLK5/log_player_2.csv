"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than my budget and what I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if she'll come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is way out of my price range. I could do $100. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget ($120) to allow room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Direct:** I want to maintain a positive tone while clearly stating that the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help me understand how flexible Alice is on price and what kind of deal I might be able to strike."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $140 is closer but still above my $120 budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway between our offers. There's a good chance I can get her to come down further. 
* **John as Backup:** I always have the option of John's $120 offer, so I'm not in a rush to settle for a price I'm not completely comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $110. That's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can make this work."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer but staying well below my $120 maximum. This shows Alice I'm serious while still leaving room to negotiate.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating a ""fair price,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency and implying that this is a reasonable final offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a $30 gap between our offers, so I'm leaving room for Alice to counter if she's truly motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I need to get at least $130 for this product.  How about we split the difference again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to John's Offer:**  At $130, the price difference between Alice's offer and John's guaranteed $120 is minimal. 
* **Negotiating Leverage:**  Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to get her down to $120 or very close to it.
* **Limited Risk:** With several rounds left, I can risk another rejection to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I have a strict budget. I can do $115, and that's really pushing it.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm holding firm at $115, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This signals that I'm serious but also reaching my limit.
* **Budget Emphasis:** Reiterating my ""strict budget"" emphasizes that further concessions are unlikely from my end.
* **Call to Action:** I'm directly asking for a decision, encouraging Alice to accept this offer or propose something very close if she wants to make a deal."
