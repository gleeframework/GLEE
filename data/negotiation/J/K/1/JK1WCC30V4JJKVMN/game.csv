"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $11000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
