Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has incentive to counteroffer since he values the product higher. 
* **Is within a reasonable range:** It's likely Bob will find this price attractive, given his valuation. 

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer or go to John for the guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're providing, I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. That would still be a great deal for you, given that you value the product at $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
