"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're providing, I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. That would still be a great deal for you, given that you value the product at $12,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000 and still saves Bob $2,500 compared to his initial valuation. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and leaving him with only the option of buying from John for a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly better price."
