"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now. I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product! After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a little.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,200.  How about we split the difference and I pay $8,800? It's a fair price for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $9,100. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9100.0,Alice,5,
