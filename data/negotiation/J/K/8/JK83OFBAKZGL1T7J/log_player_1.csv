"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $120, knowing that the product is worth $80 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's better than what Bob offered.  $110 is a reasonable compromise, and I hope it will encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer $100, we're getting close to that number, and with the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or the possibility of John's offer changing, $95 seems like a good compromise."
