{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice knows the product's worth to Bob ($12,000) and her minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects, Alice can confidently sell to John for her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while ensuring Alice doesn't sell below her minimum."
