"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $75. We believe this is a great deal, and we hope you'll find it appealing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good deal for Bob because it's below his maximum price of $80. There's no need to risk a counteroffer and potentially lose the opportunity to buy the product at a lower price."
