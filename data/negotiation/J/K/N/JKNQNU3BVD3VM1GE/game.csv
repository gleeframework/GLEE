"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $12,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  How about we agree on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $7,000?  That's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $7,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
