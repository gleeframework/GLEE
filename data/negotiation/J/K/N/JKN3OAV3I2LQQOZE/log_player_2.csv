"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for a special price of $90. It's a steal, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than Alice's value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should reject this offer and go with your better alternative."
