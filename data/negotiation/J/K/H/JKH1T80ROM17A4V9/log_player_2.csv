"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your target price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and hopefully secure a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still too high for your budget. You should continue negotiating to try to bring the price closer to your target. You have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a decision yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit too high. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to your target of $800,000, but you still have room to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since you have several rounds left. By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a price closer to your budget, potentially bringing the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and reflects a compromise from both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still higher than your target price of $800,000, but you're getting closer. You have a few more rounds left, so you should continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further.  You have a better chance of getting a lower price by rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in negotiating. While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $912500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are running out of rounds, and Alice's offer of $912,500 is still significantly above your target price of $800,000. It's unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate down to your target price in the remaining round.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure you get the best possible price."
