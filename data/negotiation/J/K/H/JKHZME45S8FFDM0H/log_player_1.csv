Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested.  
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:** The offered price is high, but still potentially attractive to Bob if the product's value to him outweighs the price difference. 

This approach aims to balance maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and going with your guaranteed sale to John."
