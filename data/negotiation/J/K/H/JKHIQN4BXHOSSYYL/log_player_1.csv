{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,400,000 is a significant increase, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to sell to John for $1,500,000, so this offer gives you some wiggle room if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer and respond. 

This strategy aims to maximize your chances of getting a good price while still being open to negotiation and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below your minimum valuation of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for you. While you could consider a counteroffer, it's likely that Bob won't budge much from his offer. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees you your minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for both of us.  This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than your minimum and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** The message is friendly but firm, reminding Bob of the product's value and suggesting a middle ground.
* **Opportunity:**  This counteroffer allows you to test Bob's willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable outcome.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while aiming to secure a price closer to your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is closer to your minimum value, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  You're better off rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

Here's why:

* **Risk of Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for you.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still room for negotiation with Bob. You can try to meet somewhere in the middle between $800,000 and your last offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your leverage in the negotiation. 

The goal is to maximize your profit without resorting to selling to John at a lower price than you could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and your previous one.
* **Reasoning:**  The message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Strategic Move:** This offer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable outcome for yourself. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving while maximizing your chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
