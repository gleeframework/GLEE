{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Value Gap:**  There's a large gap between your minimum ($800,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,000,000), making it likely Bob will want to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer allows for potential counteroffers and further negotiation.  If Bob counteroffers, you can still reach a price that's higher than your minimum.
* **John's Offer:** You always have John as a backup option, ensuring you'll never sell below your minimum."

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm eager to work with you, $850,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, it's a reasonable compromise and secures a sale. It's important to remember that I have John as a backup buyer if this deal falls through, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
