Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
