Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
