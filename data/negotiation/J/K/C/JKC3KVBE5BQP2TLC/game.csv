"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product, and it's a significant discount from my original offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering.",950000.0,Bob,4,

This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
