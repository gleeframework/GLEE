{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a higher price knowing that Bob values it at $1,000,000.  However, I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of the product, and it's a significant discount from my original offer. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that is significantly below the product's worth.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value of the product.  I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
``` 

I'm aiming for a price just above John's offer, but still keeping the negotiation open with Bob.  This counteroffer is a strong signal that I'm committed to a deal with him but also not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is closer to my desired price, but it's still not quite there.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm running the risk of a drawn-out process and potentially losing out on a sale altogether.  At this point, selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and a price that is only slightly less than what I'd hoped to achieve.  It's time to move on and secure the sale."
