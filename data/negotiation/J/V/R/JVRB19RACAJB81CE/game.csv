,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to make a deal, $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the value I'm confident you'll gain.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise considering our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
