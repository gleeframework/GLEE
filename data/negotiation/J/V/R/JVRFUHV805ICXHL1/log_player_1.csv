Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to $150 as possible, but I'm also being realistic about Bob's perceived value of the product. It's important to start the negotiation strong but not so high that Bob immediately rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I really like the product, but I can't go above $125. Let me know if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired $150, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
