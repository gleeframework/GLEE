# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the costs, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still ensuring I get a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit and seems unwilling to go much lower. Accepting at $1,275,000 saves a significant amount compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation pushing the price closer to the $1,300,000 mark."
