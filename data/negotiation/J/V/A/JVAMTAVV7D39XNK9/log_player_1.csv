Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong buyer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John provides a guaranteed $12,000, Alice should aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,500 is a significant markup but not exorbitantly high, especially if the product's value to Bob is truly $12,000. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer, Alice creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Respectful Negotiation:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and offering a fair (if ambitious) price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. The ideal price depends on various factors, such as Bob's perceived eagerness, the product's uniqueness, and Alice's risk tolerance."
