"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, given its value to me. This offer reflects the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up from your initial valuation.  While your offer is attractive, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. This offer demonstrates my serious intent to purchase and is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
