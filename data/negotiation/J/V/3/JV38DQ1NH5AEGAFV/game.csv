"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $160? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $145.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $160 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about $155? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
