"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
