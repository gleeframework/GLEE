"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to go up to $10500 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
