(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, he can likely get a better price.  He has several rounds left to negotiate and John is still a viable option."

Bob raises his offer slightly to $15,000. This demonstrates that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a fair deal. Since John is willing to sell at this price, it's a good starting point for Alice to consider."
