"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm aware that Bob values the product at $15,000, so this offer might seem high, but I want to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum value, so I cannot accept it. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering $16,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value of $15,000. I've already lost some rounds negotiating, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the remaining rounds.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the sale."
