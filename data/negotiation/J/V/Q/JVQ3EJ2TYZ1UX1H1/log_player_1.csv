Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $85. Can we meet in the middle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to think about buying from John for $80, so I hope we can meet at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum threshold of $120.  Given that John is willing to pay me $120, it makes more sense to sell to John and secure a better price."
