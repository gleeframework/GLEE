"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $20,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $19,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my financial constraints.",19000.0,Bob,4,
