Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still well within my budget and a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
