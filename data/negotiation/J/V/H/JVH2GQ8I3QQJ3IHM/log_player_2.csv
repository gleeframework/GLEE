"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also gives you room to negotiate a better price. There's potential to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still well within my budget and a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This price still represents a significant discount from its true value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000, but it's still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product at a favorable price."
