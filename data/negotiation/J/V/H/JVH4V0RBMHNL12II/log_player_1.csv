"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a higher price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. This gives me some room to maneuver if he rejects the offer.  However, I'm aware that selling to John for $800,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I still believe the product is worth more than $700,000, and I'm confident I can reach a more agreeable price with Bob."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount. I have a few rounds left, so there's still time to reach an agreement."
