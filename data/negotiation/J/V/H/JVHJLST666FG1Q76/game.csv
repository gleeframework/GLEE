"I appreciate your interest, Bob. $7000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $8500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to achieve my target price. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $8250. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
