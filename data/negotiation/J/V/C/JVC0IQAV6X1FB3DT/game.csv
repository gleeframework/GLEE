"Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it for $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $140. It's closer to what I can afford, and still a good deal for you considering you can sell to John for $120.",140.0,Bob,4,
