Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. It's priced at $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering a price of $100 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Keep it reasonable:**  While aiming high,  $100 is still within a reasonable markup for Bob, considering the product is worth $80 to him. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a higher price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
