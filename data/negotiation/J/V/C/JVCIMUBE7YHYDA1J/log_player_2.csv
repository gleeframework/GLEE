Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105, and it's a reasonable price compared to John's $120. Accepting now secures the deal."
