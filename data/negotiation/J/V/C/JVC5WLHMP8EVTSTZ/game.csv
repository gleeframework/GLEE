"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best possible deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my final offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
