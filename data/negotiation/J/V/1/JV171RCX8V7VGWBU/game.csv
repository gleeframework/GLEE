"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter, and I'd love to get the best deal possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9300. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9300.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9200? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your commitment to the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9200. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $9350. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I hope you'll consider it.",9350.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9350 and $9200, which would be $9275. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",9275.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9275. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $9325. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, and I hope you'll consider it.",9325.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best price, Alice, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9200. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price.",9200.0,Bob,8,
