Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $9,500 offer gives Bob some room to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still allowing me to make a profit. 
* **Keeping John as an Option:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John at $10,000 open, so if Bob doesn't accept my initial offer, I'm not losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested. This gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I'm still keeping the option to sell to John for $10,000 open, ensuring I don't lose out on a guaranteed higher price if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $7,000. 
* **Staying above minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, ensuring I don't lose out on profit.
* **Maintaining a negotiation tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and acknowledging Bob's offer to keep the negotiation positive and increase the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm ready to close the deal if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Bob's eagerness:** Bob's message indicates he's ready to close the deal, showing his strong interest in acquiring the product.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'm accepting this offer, I'm also leaving open the possibility of a slight counteroffer if Bob is still willing to negotiate.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer at $8,250 is the most sensible decision as it gets me close to my desired price while securing a sale without risking a potential breakdown in negotiations."
