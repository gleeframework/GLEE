"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting with a significantly lower offer ($7,000), I'm aiming to establish a bargaining position that allows for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** My counteroffer leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my maximum budget of $8,000.  
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message maintains a polite and respectful tone, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I can still try to negotiate a slightly better deal.  I'm only $500 away from my ideal price with John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm ready to close the deal if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 8250
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a compromise by suggesting a price directly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By expressing readiness to ""close the deal,"" I'm signaling that this is a serious offer and encouraging Alice to make a decision.
* **Staying Below Budget:** This offer keeps me comfortably below my $8,000 maximum while still potentially securing a better price than John's offer."
