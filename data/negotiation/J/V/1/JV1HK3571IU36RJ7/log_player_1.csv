Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a discounted price of $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you, even at a slightly lower price than my absolute bottom line."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and potential ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially leading to a sale above $12,000.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
