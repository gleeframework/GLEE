Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,850,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of him walking away altogether.  It's a good deal at this point."
