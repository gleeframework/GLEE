"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'll try to negotiate a better price before settling for $700,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $900,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is still lower than I would ideally like, it's getting closer to my minimum value.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price."
