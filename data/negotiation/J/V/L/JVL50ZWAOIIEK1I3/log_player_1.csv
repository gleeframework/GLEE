"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000,  which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle at $15,500. This would be a win-win for both of us, as it's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already rejected his last two offers.  I've also reached the halfway point in the negotiations.  It's getting risky to keep pushing Bob, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed sale."
