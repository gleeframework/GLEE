"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going for the full $1,200,000 immediately, as I want to give Bob a chance to counteroffer and potentially arrive at a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for Bob by highlighting the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher potential:** While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I have 10 rounds and believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding risk:** Selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, but I'm not willing to forgo the potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our conversation, I'm still a bit higher than your offer.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-proposal that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintain value:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable value, keeping the potential for a good deal alive.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I still have 6 rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding risk:** While selling to John would guarantee my minimum price, I'm not willing to forgo the potential for a better deal with Bob.
* **Potential for compromise:** There's still room to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit higher than your current offer.  To move forward, I'm prepared to offer the product for $965,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small adjustment:** I'm only slightly increasing my offer, showing a commitment to compromise but still remaining above my minimum value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited time:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate.
* **Guaranteeing a sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit for me.
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though it's slightly below my ideal price, establishing a good relationship with Bob could lead to future business opportunities."
