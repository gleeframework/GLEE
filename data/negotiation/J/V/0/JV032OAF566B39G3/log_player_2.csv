"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $2,250,000 is significantly more than his maximum budget of $1,500,000. There is room for negotiation, and it's always better to try and get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,250,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the significant value this product brings. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $2,000,000 is better than $2,250,000, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 is getting closer, it's still outside my price range.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,500,000.  This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your firm stance and understand your perspective on the value.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,750,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true worth of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,750,000 is getting closer to his target price, it's still above his budget. He has a few more rounds to negotiate and can aim for a lower price.  He can also factor in the risk that Alice might not budge further, and he might have to settle with John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and equitable deal for both parties.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer of $1,675,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still not within his desired range.  He has a couple of rounds left, and he should reject this offer and continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  He needs to consider the risk that Alice might not budge further and he'll have to settle with John, but he should aim for a price closer to his goal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you're committed to $1,675,000, but that's still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $1,625,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1625000}
