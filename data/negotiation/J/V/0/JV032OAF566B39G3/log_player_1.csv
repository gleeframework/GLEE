"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,250,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the significant value this product brings. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 is getting closer, it's still outside my price range.  I'm firm on my initial offer of $1,500,000.  This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it represents a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly holding firm at his valuation. While accepting his offer is always an option, there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. We're not in a desperate rush, so continuing the negotiation for now makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance and understand your perspective on the value.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,750,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true worth of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We've gotten Bob to move up from his initial offer. This indicates a willingness to negotiate on his part. While we could accept his current offer, there's still potential to secure a higher price. It's worth risking another counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair and equitable deal for both parties. "", 
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, it's strategic to signal that we're nearing our bottom line. By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to seriously consider the proposal. The slight concession keeps the negotiation moving but also emphasizes our position on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're committed to $1,675,000, but that's still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $1,625,000. This is a fair price considering both our positions, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly trying to meet us somewhere in the middle. While we'd ideally want the full $1,675,000, accepting his offer of $1,625,000 is a strong outcome. It reflects a significant profit over our minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation, potentially ending in us having to sell to John at our baseline price."
