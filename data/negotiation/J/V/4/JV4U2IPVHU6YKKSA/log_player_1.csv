Round 2

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? This would give us both a good deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 6
