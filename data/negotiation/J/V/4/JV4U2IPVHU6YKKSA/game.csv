"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product. Let's try to reach an agreement, and I believe we can both walk away happy.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? This would give us both a good deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
