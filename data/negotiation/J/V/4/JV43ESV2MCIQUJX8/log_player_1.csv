"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune, and I believe it will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value and potential of this product. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
