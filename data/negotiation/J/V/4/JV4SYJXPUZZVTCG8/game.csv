"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $700,000? That would make this a worthwhile deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
