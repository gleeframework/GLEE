Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $135.  It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $125 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $130. This is a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit more than I can pay right now.  I'm sticking to my offer of $125.  If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob seems unwilling to budge on his offer, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting nothing from Bob."
