"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $135.  It's a great deal for you, and a good starting point for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good starting point, Bob wants to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring if he can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still above his maximum price point but significantly lower than Alice's offer. This shows his willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating that he is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $130. This is a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still get the product for $120 from John. There's still room to negotiate with Alice, and Bob wants to see if he can push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $130 is still a bit more than I can pay right now.  I'm sticking to my offer of $125.  If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $125. He's demonstrating his firmness and reiterating his commitment to a fair price. He's also subtly mentioning ""other options"" to remind Alice of his alternative with John."
