"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,100,000. I'll counteroffer and see if he's willing to budge further. I still have several rounds to negotiate and the option to sell to John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $1,150,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal while still recognizing the product's inherent value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I still need to make a bit more of a dent in the price. Can we meet at $1,075,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting close to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'll push a little further, but I need to be mindful of not pushing him away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator, I appreciate that. Let's make this happen - $1,100,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've decided to hold firm at $1,100,000.  This is my walk-away point. Bob has shown he's willing to move, and this offer represents a significant profit above my minimum. By presenting it as my final offer, I'm hoping to encourage him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,075,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled that this is his final offer. While it's slightly below my ideal price, it's still a significant profit margin ($75,000) above my guaranteed sale to John. Accepting now avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely by pushing further."
