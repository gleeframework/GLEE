"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,100,000? This price still offers you a substantial value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
