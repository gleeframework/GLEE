"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about we settle on $1,125,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to sell the product without having to go with another buyer. I'm confident this is the best we can do, and I hope you'll agree.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
