"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and for you to get a good price.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still looking for a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident that we can close the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $11,125 is a fair price for the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11125.0,Alice,5,
