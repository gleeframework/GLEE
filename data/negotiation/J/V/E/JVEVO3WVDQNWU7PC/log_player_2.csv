"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a great price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get the product for less by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter.  Would you be willing to do $10,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and for you to get a good price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. While Alice's offer is better than the initial $11,500, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially getting closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still looking for a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us and I'm confident that we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $11,125 is a fair price for the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,125 is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still above his limit.  At this point, the negotiation is taking a lot of time and there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to budge. Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. It's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing."
