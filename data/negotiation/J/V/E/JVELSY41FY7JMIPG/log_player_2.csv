"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $120 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are looking for a product worth no more than $80 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given your valuation, I think a fair price for the product would be $95. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate lower. You can use John's offer of $80 as leverage in future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget.  Since you're willing to negotiate, I'm going to stick with my offer of $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about $90? I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your target than John's price, you still have some room to negotiate.  You can try to push for a lower price, potentially meeting Alice in the middle, before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $85.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I respect your decision, Bob. Let's try $88 as the final offer. It's slightly higher than your last proposal but still within your range. This should be a fair conclusion to our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $88, which is just slightly above your target of $80. It's a good compromise, especially since you have only 3 rounds remaining.  While you could try to negotiate lower, there's a risk that Alice will reject and you might end up having to buy from John at $80 anyway."
