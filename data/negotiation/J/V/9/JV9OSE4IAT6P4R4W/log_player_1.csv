"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price allows room for negotiation and ensures a higher profit for me. 
* **Fairness:** While the price is high, it's not unreasonable given the product's value to me.
* **Open Communication:**  The message encourages Bob to engage and discuss the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range and see if he's willing to budge. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit, but I want to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiating Down:** I'm lowering my price, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Attractive Price:**  $1,050,000 is still a good profit for me and potentially within Bob's budget, given his initial counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and encouraging, reinforcing the desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $900,000 is a good price for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's counteroffer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Closing in on a deal:** The negotiations are getting closer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I keep the negotiation open and potentially lead to a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If the negotiations fall apart, I can always sell to John and guarantee a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,012,500? This is a significant concession from my last offer, but it's important to me that we find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession to show flexibility and willingness to close the deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The proposed price is the average of my last offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating a genuine attempt to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** The message reinforces the importance of finding a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiations going and avoids losing the potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Losing Too Much:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing too much money.
* **Limited Time:**  We are already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing may not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum goal. It's a safe and reliable option.

I've decided to sell to John. It's a tough choice, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
