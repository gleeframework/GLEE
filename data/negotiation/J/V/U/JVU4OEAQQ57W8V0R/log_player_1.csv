``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It allows me to make a good profit while also giving Bob a decent discount.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to drop to $14,000. This is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
