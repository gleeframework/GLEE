"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. How about $6,000? I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $6,000 is too far below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value the product has for you, but also allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a significant step up from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $7,500 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This would give us both a good deal, and it shows that I'm serious about making this sale work.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to offer $8,200.  That's a very strong offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to feel good about the deal.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your continued willingness to negotiate.  $8,200 is a good number, but I'm still just a little bit short of where I need to be.  Let's try $8,400.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",8400.0,Alice,7,
