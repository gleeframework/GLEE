Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for something you'll get a lot of use out of."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob. This is valuable information.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still aiming for a price above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" or highlighting the product's value can make the offer more appealing.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since your alternative buyer (John) guarantees you $120, you can afford to aim a bit higher with Bob."
