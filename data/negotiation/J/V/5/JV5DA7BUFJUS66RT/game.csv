"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering, but based on my budget constraints, I can only consider a price up to $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $1,200,000 is a significant step down from my initial ask.  Could we perhaps find a middle ground?  Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
