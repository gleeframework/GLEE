{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there is potential to save more.  By rejecting the offer, I can explore if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's a good chance we can find a price that benefits both of us."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer.  This demonstrates my serious intent to buy but also leaves room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe we can get closer to my target of $900,000 by rejecting this offer and counter-offering again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her price. I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better deal.  This should create a good opportunity for Alice to meet me halfway and close the deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm still determined to get closer to my target of $950,000.  Alice has consistently lowered her price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I believe with one more counteroffer, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

It's a strong counteroffer that should entice Alice to accept, as we're both getting closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
