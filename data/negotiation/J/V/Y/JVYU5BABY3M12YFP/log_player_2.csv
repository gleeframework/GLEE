"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money, and there's potential to save even more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired range. He has already successfully negotiated a lower price, so there's a strong chance he can get even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down from Alice's initial $1,200,000 offer to $1,120,000.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a diminishing return on the potential savings. 

* **Risk:**  Continuing to reject offers could lead to Alice becoming less willing to negotiate or even walking away from the deal entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:** The longer Bob negotiates, the longer he delays acquiring the product. 

Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price well below his maximum budget and provides a good balance between price and risk."
