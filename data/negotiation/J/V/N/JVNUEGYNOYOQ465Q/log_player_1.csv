Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price and negotiate down. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, you're setting an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even though he knows it's worth $80 to him, the initial higher price might make him more receptive to a slightly lower counter-offer (that's still profitable for you).
* **John as a safety net:** You have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $80, so you can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
