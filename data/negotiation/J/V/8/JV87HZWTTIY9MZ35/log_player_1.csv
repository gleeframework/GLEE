Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and highlights the value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly open to negotiation with the phrase ""Let me know your thoughts!"". 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential gain:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A positive and open approach encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Maintain my bargaining power:**  The higher starting price gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can do better:** While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below my ideal price point. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I believe I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 yet, but rejecting his offer doesn't mean I'm completely dismissing him. 

By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and can explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our negotiation,  $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's split the difference - how about $975,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the win-win nature of the offer, making it more appealing.
* **Direct Question:** The question ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

By proposing a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, I hope to  secure a deal that's more favorable while still being realistic about Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I propose $960000 as a fair price. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  $960,000 is only $40,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I reject Bob's offer, we might get stuck in a back-and-forth negotiation loop that could drag on. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have John's offer of $1,200,000 as a backup, which means I'm not in a desperate position.

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a stalemate or the potential for Bob to walk away completely."
