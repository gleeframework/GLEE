Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum, and I don't think I can get a better price from him at this point. John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, which is better than risking further negotiation with Bob."
