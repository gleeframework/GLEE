"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900000 is a bit high for me. Considering the potential benefits, I'm willing to pay $700000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $750000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $750000, which would be $775000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $775000 is still a bit too high.  Let's try $760000.  I'm confident this price will give us both a great deal, and I'm ready to move forward.",760000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $765000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,7,
