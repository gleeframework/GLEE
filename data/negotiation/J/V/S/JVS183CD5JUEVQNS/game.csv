"Hey Alice,  I appreciate you offering the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? I'm really interested in getting this, but I need to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
