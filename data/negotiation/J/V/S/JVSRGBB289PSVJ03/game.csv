"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree this product is valuable, $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $500,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my budget.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not comfortable going that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to counteroffer at $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $750,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to counteroffer at $700,000. This is a reasonable compromise that takes into account your budget constraints and the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell we both see the value in this deal.  To show I'm serious, I can offer $660,000.  That's a big jump from my last offer.",660000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a big jump in your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to counteroffer at $685,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging the progress we've made in our negotiations.",685000.0,Alice,7,
