"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me to make a significant profit. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your original price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would still leave you with a very healthy profit, and it's closer to my valuation.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to come down a bit. I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $925,000. This would allow both of us to walk away with a solid deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close this deal now.",940000.0,Alice,5,
