"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above Bob's value of $80, but below my minimum of $120, so there's room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85, which is still above Bob's value but closer to his offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell at a huge loss. The message is friendly and keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $80, which is the middle ground between my last offer and Bob's. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, hoping to encourage him to accept."
