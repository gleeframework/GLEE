Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting at $900,000 allows room for negotiation while still being close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for multiple rounds of negotiation, giving me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my price accordingly. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a good price. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. I'll be prepared to go down slightly, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's still interested. This gives me leverage to negotiate further.
* **John is a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer provides security and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price higher than $700,000 but lower than my initial offer of $900,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, reflecting the value of the product.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $850,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $900,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $700,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  I highlight the ""value of the product"" to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  Let me know. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly halfway between my last offer of $850,000 and his previous offer of $700,000.  This indicates a willingness to compromise.
* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $800,000 is less than my ideal price, it's still within my acceptable range, as I wouldn't accept anything below $1,000,000.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Further negotiations could drag on, and there's no guarantee I'd get a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal. This secures a good price for the product, and I can avoid the potential risks of further negotiations."
