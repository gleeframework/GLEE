Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for back-and-forth without immediately shutting down the negotiation. 

By starting with a moderate offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
