,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $15,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product, recognizing its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to a fair deal, I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,250 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $9,900.  Let's find a final number that works for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,8,
