"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,400,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,550,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.  I believe this is a mutually beneficial compromise.  What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,475,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows me to acquire the product at a good value.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
