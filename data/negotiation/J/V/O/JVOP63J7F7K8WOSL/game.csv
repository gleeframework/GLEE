"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,000? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $13,000 isn't quite enough for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $13,250? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to be happy with the outcome.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $12,750? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,6,
