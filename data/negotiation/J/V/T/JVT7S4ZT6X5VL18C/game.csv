"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. How about $1,000,000? This allows for a significant profit for you, while still giving me a respectable return.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
