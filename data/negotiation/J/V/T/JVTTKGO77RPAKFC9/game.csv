"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, I have other options I need to consider at that price point. If you're willing to go down to $700,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore those alternatives.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you have other options, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on this deal yet. I can do $850,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make it work.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. You've come down quite a bit, and I respect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm sure you understand. Let me know if it works for you, otherwise, I'll need to pursue those other options I mentioned.",775000.0,Bob,6,
