"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that price. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to a reasonable price.  However, to be realistic, we need to be much closer to the $600,000 range I proposed. I'm willing to offer $700,000 to keep things moving, but that's as high as I can go at this point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
