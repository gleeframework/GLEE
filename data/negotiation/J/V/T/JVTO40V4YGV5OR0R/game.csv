,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,350,000 is a good price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. Can you consider this offer?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,337,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal!",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $1,325,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, at $1,331,250. This is a compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. If you're serious about getting this product, I believe this is the final offer we can agree on.",1331250.0,Alice,7,
