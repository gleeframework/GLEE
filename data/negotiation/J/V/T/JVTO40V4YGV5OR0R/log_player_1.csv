I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob. He's shown he's willing to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for $1,325,000 just yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer."

Bob has made it clear he won't go any higher than $1,325,000.  While I'd love to get a better price, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and secures a sale."
