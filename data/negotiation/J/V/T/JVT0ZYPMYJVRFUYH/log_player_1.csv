"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price, but still below my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm positive and encouraging, emphasizing the potential value for Bob.
* **Strategy:** This initial offer sets the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation. By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be a reasonable price.  I'm willing to offer $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000).**  Selling to Bob at this price would result in a huge loss.
* **I have 9 rounds left and a guaranteed alternative buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price.**  It's not worth risking a much lower price just yet.

**Strategy:** 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but still acknowledging Bob's interest. I'll also emphasize the value proposition of my product, trying to shift his perspective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While your offer is lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This price still allows you a considerable profit, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's but still lower than my minimum value, creating space for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining a firm stance on value. I'm also highlighting the potential profit he can still make at this price.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. By presenting it as a mutually beneficial outcome, I aim to convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a big gap. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While he's moving closer, the gap is still significant.
* **I have 6 rounds left and a guaranteed sale to John for a much higher price.** There's no reason to settle for such a low price at this stage.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap while staying above my minimum. I'll continue to emphasize the value proposition of the product and highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $700,000 is simply too low. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm offering a price of $1,000,000.  This gives you a substantial margin for profit while still allowing me to achieve a fair price. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still above my minimum value. I'm demonstrating flexibility while staying firm on the value of the product.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while maintaining a confident tone. I'm emphasizing the product's value and presenting my offer as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is intended to bridge the gap and potentially lead to a deal within the next few rounds. I'm trying to strike a balance between making a concession while not giving away too much."
