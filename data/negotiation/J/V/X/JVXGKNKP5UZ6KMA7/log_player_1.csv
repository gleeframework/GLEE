"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate while still hoping to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, but I don't want to risk selling to John yet. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm going to see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round.  I still have a good chance to get a better price, and I'm not desperate to sell to John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm finally offering Bob my minimum price. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. If he rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John to avoid further negotiation."
