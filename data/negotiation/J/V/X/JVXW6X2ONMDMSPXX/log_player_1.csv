Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for the negotiation.  It's above my minimum price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for potential compromise. By offering a price that's below what the product is worth to Bob, I increase the chances of him accepting the offer. However, if he rejects, I'm still in a good position to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $1,200,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  There's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for $1,300,000 just yet.  I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you given the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
