"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm able to pay.  Let me know if this is something you'd consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, $800000 is below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product, and I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession to see if we can reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
