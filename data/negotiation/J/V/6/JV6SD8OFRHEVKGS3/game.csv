"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $6,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
