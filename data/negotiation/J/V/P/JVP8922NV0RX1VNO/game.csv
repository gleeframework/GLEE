"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique asset that I'm confident will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for it,  which is still a strong price considering my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and its potential to benefit your business. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. If you're serious about making a deal, I believe this is a reasonable starting point.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make a new offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll come down to $850000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and its potential benefits. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $850000 is still outside my budget. To make this deal work, I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $750000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my limited budget. If you're serious about selling, let's try to find a compromise here.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'll make one more concession and offer you a price of $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still beyond my budget. To make this deal work, I'm going to need to stick with my offer of $800000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already at my budget limit.  If you're serious about selling, let's close this deal now.",800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're at your budget limit, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $825000, which is the same price I offered in Round 7. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Alice,9,
