Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** While this is a starting point, observing Bob's reactions and being open to slight adjustments in price could further maximize profit."
