Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is understanding your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement).  Your BATNA is selling the product to John for $1,500,000.  Therefore, you should never accept an offer below this price. 

Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.  We want to start the negotiation aiming for the higher end of that range.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Confident Opening:**  The message starts by highlighting the product's value and exclusivity. This sets a positive tone and emphasizes the product's worth.
* **Strong Starting Point:** The price of $1,450,000 is a strong opening position, leaving room for potential negotiation while still staying close to your BATNA.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention negotiation, it doesn't close the door either. The way you frame your response to Bob's counter-offer will determine how the negotiation proceeds. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  If he comes back with a counter-offer, carefully consider if you're willing to go lower or if it's time to walk away and sell to John."
