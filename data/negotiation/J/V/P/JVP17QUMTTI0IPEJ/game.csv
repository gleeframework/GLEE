"I appreciate your commitment to the deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'd like to add a condition. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000, but I need you to agree to a 2-year maintenance contract worth $50,000 per year. This will ensure the product continues to run smoothly and efficiently for you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
