Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to the deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but I'd like to add a condition. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000, but I need you to agree to a 2-year maintenance contract worth $50,000 per year. This will ensure the product continues to run smoothly and efficiently for you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is cleverly disguised to appear like a win.  While the product price is now at our target of $975,000, she's added a $100,000 maintenance contract over two years. This brings the total cost to $1,075,000. 

At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield significant savings. John's offer, while higher at $1,500,000, becomes the safer and potentially more economical option in the long run. We avoid the risk of hidden costs or issues with the maintenance contract that could arise later."
