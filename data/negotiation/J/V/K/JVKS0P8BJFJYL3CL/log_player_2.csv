"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $950,000 is a decent price, you can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer. If her price doesn't come down significantly, you can always buy from John for $1,500,000 as a last resort."
