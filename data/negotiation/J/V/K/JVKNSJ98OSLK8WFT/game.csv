"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the value of this product and offers you a good price. Let's meet in the middle, and we can both walk away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
