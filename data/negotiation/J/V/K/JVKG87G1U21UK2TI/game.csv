"I appreciate the offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than it is to you. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I'm confident that we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but I'm still confident that this product holds significant value for you.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,225,000 as a compromise. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
