"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This aggressive opening tactic aims to set a high baseline and leave space for concessions in subsequent rounds. It also highlights the value I place on the product. 

I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, but I'm willing to risk a few rounds of negotiation with Bob in the hope of achieving an even higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. I believe there is potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is already willing to pay close to my lower limit. 

Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. I'll use the next round to counteroffer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's offer of $950,000 and closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to accept while still maximizing my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my lower limit of $1,000,000, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can squeeze a slightly higher price out of him. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a better deal. I'm also aware that I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000, which gives me some room to maneuver in the negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000.  This is a further decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.  However, it's still above Bob's offer of $900,000 and significantly closer to my target of $1,000,000. This counteroffer aims to find a happy medium while still maximizing my potential profit. I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot to get Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my target, we are running out of rounds.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach a deal before I run out of time.  Furthermore, his offers seem to be stalling and may not move much higher.

Given the risk of not reaching an agreement and the certainty of a $1,000,000 sale to John, it's best to secure this guaranteed profit. It's a wise decision to move forward with selling to John at this point."
