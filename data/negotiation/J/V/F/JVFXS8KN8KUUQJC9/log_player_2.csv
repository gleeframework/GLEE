Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's meet in the middle at this price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $1,200,000 than to risk Alice sticking to her price or further dragging out the negotiation."
