Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money."
