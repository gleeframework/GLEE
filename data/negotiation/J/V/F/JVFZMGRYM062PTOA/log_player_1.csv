**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has matched John's offer of $800,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation failing altogether.  It's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower price or no sale with Bob."
