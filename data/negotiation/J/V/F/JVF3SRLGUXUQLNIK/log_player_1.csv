Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $2,000 difference between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **It's a fair starting point:** By offering a price slightly below what Bob is willing to pay, you show that you're willing to negotiate but also value the product. 

This strategy aims to quickly get the negotiation rolling and see how willing Bob is to pay a price closer to your ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is still profitable for you, it's closer to your minimum. There's still room for a better deal, and rejecting his offer allows you to try and push for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, you show that you're not willing to settle for the first counteroffer and are still aiming for a higher price.  You can use the next round to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? That's a good deal for both of us, and it'll allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is a good deal for you. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000, and it's only $300 below your last counteroffer. While you could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price."
