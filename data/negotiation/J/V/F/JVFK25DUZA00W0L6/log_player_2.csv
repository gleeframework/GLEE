"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 John is offering, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what John is offering and gets Bob closer to his desired price point. While there's always a chance Bob could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
