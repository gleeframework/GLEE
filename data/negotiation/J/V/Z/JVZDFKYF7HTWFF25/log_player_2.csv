"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I believe we can both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $11,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and the price could go back up.  Accepting the offer at $11,000 ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price without risking a higher price from either Alice or John."
