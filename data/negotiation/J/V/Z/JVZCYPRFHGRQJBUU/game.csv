"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.  This leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. I'm happy to continue working with you.  How about $1,000,000? This price is still within your budget and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement and move forward. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your final offer.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go lower than $990,000.  This price represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. What do you say? ",990000.0,Alice,7,
