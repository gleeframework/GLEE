"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $180. We believe this price reflects the value you'll receive from the product.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To find a mutually beneficial solution, we propose an offer of $165. This price still allows us to earn a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a good deal.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $165 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $150. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal at this point.",150.0,Bob,4,
