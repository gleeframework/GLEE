{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting that this is a good deal for Bob, since the product is worth $8,000 to him.
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm not immediately setting a hard limit, so I can adjust the price based on Bob's response. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $15,000 gives me the flexibility to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob. He's shown interest and acknowledges the product's value. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob than John's offer, which is my backup option.  
* **Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation process, potentially securing a more favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 splits the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, as the product is worth $8,000 to him.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""reasonable profit"" helps maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, as I'm not immediately setting a hard limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000, so I'll offer $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer to my price, $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Bob has shown continued interest in the product, which suggests there's still room for negotiation.  He's also moved from his initial offer of $9,000, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safer option, but I'm not convinced that I can't get closer to that amount with Bob.
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make another counteroffer, hopefully bridging the gap further and getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $10,000 is a compromise that splits the difference between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,500. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to work towards a deal without giving away too much. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""closer to a deal"" to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Final Push:** This is likely my last offer before I consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'll make one more offer: $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,200 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer is not close enough to my desired price.
* **John's Offer is More Lucrative:** John's offer of $15,000 is far more favorable than any price I can realistically expect to get from Bob at this point. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and ultimately unproductive.  John's offer provides a quicker and more profitable solution. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Bob's final offer suggests he's not willing to go much higher. Accepting his offer could lead to regret, as I might miss out on a better deal with John."
