,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000, so I'll offer $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we settle on $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'll make one more offer: $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Bob,6,
