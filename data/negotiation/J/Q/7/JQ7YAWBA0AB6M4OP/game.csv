"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $925,000? It's still a great price considering the value this product offers. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering our target range and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
