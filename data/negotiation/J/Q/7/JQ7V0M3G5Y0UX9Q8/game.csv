"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's unique qualities. However, $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for it.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1700000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1900000. I think this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1900000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $1800000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1850000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
