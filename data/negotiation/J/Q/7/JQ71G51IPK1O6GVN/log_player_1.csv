``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial offer:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a favorable outcome.  
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob and make him more receptive to the offer.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
