Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come up in price. However, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen.
