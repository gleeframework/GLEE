Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a better deal. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and we can negotiate from there. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm still confident I can get a better price than Bob's current offer, and I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a good price for the product. This counteroffer should be more appealing to Bob while still ensuring I get a profitable sale. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my target.  At this point, I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm running the risk of spending too much time negotiating. I'm confident I can get my minimum from John, so I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid further risk."
