"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the true value of the product while hopefully still working for your budget.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can settle on this.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
