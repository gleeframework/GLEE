Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be very valuable to your business as well. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product brings to Bob, hoping to persuade him that the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize my profits with the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also much lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000, indicating a significant gap in our valuations. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is too low to consider. I believe I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a much higher amount.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'll need to make a counteroffer that bridges the gap but still maintains a reasonable profit for me.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This price reflects both the value of the product and the potential it holds for your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer while still significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value the product brings to Bob's business, hoping to justify the price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  The ""meet in the middle"" approach suggests I'm open to finding a solution, making me seem more accommodating.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still giving me a substantial profit. I believe it's a good starting point for a more fruitful discussion with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Close to John's Offer:**  While $700,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still very close to my option of selling to John for $1,200,000.  This gives me a strong bargaining position.
* **Negotiation Continued:**  There's still potential for a better deal.  I can continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial target. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and try to push for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is a significant improvement, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference at $750,000?  This price allows me to move forward while still giving you a great deal on a product that will bring significant value to your business. I'm confident it's a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $750,000 is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible while still seeking a price that's reasonable for me.
* **Reiterate Value:** I emphasize the value the product brings to Bob's business, hoping to convince him it's worth the price.
* **Win-Win Scenario:** I frame the offer as a win-win for both of us, appealing to his desire for a good deal while ensuring my own profit margin. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving, with the potential to reach an agreement that works for both parties.  I'm confident that $750,000 is a good balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal with Bob."
