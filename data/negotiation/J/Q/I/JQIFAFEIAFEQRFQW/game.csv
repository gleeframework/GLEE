"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. We're looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $800,000 for the product. It's a great price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
