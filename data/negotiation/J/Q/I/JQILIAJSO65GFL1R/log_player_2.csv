# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's very fair considering its value. I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.** Even though Alice is asking for $12,000, it's still cheaper than the $15,000 John is asking. 
* **You are trying to save as much money as possible.** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
