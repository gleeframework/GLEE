Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $75 is a little too low for me, as I'm looking to get at least $80 for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? "", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to get at least $80 for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and go with $79.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $79.5 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. Selling to John for $80 guarantees my minimum value and avoids the uncertainty of another round of negotiation."
