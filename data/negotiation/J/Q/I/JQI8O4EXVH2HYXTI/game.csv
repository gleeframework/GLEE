"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable for both parties involved.

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $875,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product for both of us. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
