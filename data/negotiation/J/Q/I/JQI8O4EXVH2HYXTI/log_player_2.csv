# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being reasonable for both parties involved. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations.

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is still a better price than buying from John, Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  He's already shown he's willing to walk away, so Alice has an incentive to come down further."
