"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Buying from Alice at $100 is cheaper than buying from John at $120.
* **The offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $20."
