Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a price above my minimum.  I'm confident I can get more than $800,000 from Bob since I know the product is worth at least that much to me, and John is a safety net if things go south."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm offering $900,000 to Bob. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this price is still attractive to Bob while giving me some margin for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's latest offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing too much money. John's offer of $800,000 guarantees me a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
