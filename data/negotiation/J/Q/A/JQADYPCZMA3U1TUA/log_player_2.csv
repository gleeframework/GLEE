Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can close this deal at $800,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the price down to $800,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a compromise I'm willing to make to close the deal, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her price, and we've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not securing the product at all. John offers the product at my maximum budget, and it's time to move forward with the purchase to avoid any further delays or complications."
