"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $900,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, recognizing its potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can close this deal at $800,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase. Let's finalize this and make it happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the price down to $800,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's a compromise I'm willing to make to close the deal, but I need you to meet me halfway.",825000.0,Alice,5,
