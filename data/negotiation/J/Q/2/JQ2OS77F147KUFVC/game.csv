"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in lower at $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to come in lower, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,220,000. This is my final offer for now.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
