"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob can definitely do better than $1,300,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in lower at $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to come in lower, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob can still get a better deal than $1,250,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,220,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is offering $1,220,000 which is still a good deal for Bob.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will budge again and he risks losing the deal.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
