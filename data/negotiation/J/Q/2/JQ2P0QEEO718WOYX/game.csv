"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get a bit more for it. How about we discuss $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'd need to get at least $11000 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $9500?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10200. Would you be willing to consider $9800?",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to lose patience here. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10500. This is my last offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting frustrated, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $10000. Would you be willing to accept that price?",10000.0,Bob,10,
