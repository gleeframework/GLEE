"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he values the product at, and we know it's worth less to him than it is to us.  There's no room for further negotiation. We can get our minimum acceptable price from John."
