"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this incredible product that I believe will be a huge asset to your business.  My asking price is $1,000,000, which is a significant value considering its potential to generate even more for you.  Let's discuss this further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob might be able to get Alice to lower the price further."
