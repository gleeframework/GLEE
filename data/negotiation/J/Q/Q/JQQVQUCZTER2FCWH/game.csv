"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still providing you with a good value.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll go with $9,750. Can you meet me at that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
