"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $85. How about we try $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to go up to $95, which is still less than your original price. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $100. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",100.0,Alice,5,
