Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room for negotiation while still maximizing my profit.  I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price lower than my minimum threshold of $120.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $125. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum threshold and hopefully signals my willingness to compromise while still securing a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold.  While I'd like to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $120.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiations that might not lead to a successful outcome."
