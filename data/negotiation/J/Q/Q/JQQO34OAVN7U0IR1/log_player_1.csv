Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, he might be willing to pay a premium for it if he perceives the offer as valuable.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $120, ensuring we don't sell below our minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer.  We might need to adjust the price based on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
