"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $12,000 is considerably below its worth. I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This offer reflects the product's value while still offering you a reasonable deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'd be willing to go up to $14,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $14,000 is getting close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,5,
