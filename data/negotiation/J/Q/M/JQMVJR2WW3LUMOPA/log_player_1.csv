{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a compromise that allows me to earn a good profit while still appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is the lowest I can go. It still leaves me some room to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my ideal price point, and it's a significant improvement on his previous offer.  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  Accepting this offer will allow me to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation process moving."
