"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business.  Given its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,400,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for this product. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing $1,300,000. This gives you a good price point and allows me to secure a fair value for the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price point. There's still potential for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving and might lead to a more favorable price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,250,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,250,000 simply doesn't cover my minimum requirements.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident that this is the best offer I can make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is the closest she has come to Bob's desired price point.  While it's still slightly higher than Bob's ideal, it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is within his budget and saves him a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
