"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I believe $825000 is a fair compromise. This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to get a reasonable return. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from $825000. I'd be willing to meet you at $775000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
