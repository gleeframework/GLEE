"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's potential to get it for less than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking to spend closer to $9,500 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $9,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating my serious intent to buy while still being within my budget. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation and allows Alice to counter if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $10,250 is a great price, significantly lower than John's $12,000 and still above Alice's minimum of $8,000. This shows a good compromise. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could counter again, there's a risk Alice will walk away or continue to counter in a way that's not beneficial to me.  It's better to secure a good price now rather than risk missing out."
