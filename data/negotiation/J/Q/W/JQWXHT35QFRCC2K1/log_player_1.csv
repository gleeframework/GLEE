"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a significant markup ($750,000 above Bob's valuation) to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This opening offer establishes a strong bargaining position, allowing us to potentially negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,875,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum, it's still significantly higher than John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. Rejecting and countering keeps the negotiation open and allows us to gauge Bob's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,875,000 is still below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000? This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budgetary concerns."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We show willingness to negotiate by lowering the price, but the decrease is moderate ($150,000) to signal that we're not giving in easily.
* **Anchoring:**  Proposing  $2,100,000 as a ""middle ground"" aims to anchor the negotiation closer to our initial ask. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget, attempting to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still working within a strict budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $2,000,000 represents a $500,000 profit margin, significantly exceeding John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob withdrawing or lowering his offer. Accepting now secures a favorable deal."
