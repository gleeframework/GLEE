"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than its initial cost.  While I can't disclose specifics without a non-disclosure agreement, I'm confident it's something you'll find extremely beneficial.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, which I personally estimate at over $2 million.  I'm eager to discuss the details further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
