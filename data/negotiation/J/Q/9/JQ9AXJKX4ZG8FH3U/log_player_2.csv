"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you our exceptional product at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire an item valued at $1,200,000 for a competitive rate. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a lot of room for negotiation between $950,000 and our walk-away price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's opening offer, but it's still a price that leaves room for negotiation and keeps us comfortably below our walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $875,000? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount compared to the original price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with.  It's time to inch my offer up a bit to signal I'm serious, but I still see room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000. Would you consider $810,000?"",
""product_price"": 810000
}
```

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to move, but we're still holding firm to a price that benefits us. This offer is closer to her value but still gives us a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I've decided to offer the product to you at $840,000. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000.

Alice is getting closer to a palatable price, but we're not quite there yet. One more counter-offer should do it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

This counter-offer splits the difference between our last two offers and presents it as our final offer to encourage Alice to accept.  We're still well below our walk-away price while offering Alice a price significantly above her value."
