Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still potentially secure a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he's price-sensitive. If he counteroffers, it indicates he's seriously considering the purchase. 
* **John as a Backup:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in negotiations, as you're not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's worth countering to see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to make a deal, $11,000 is below my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):** This offer positions the negotiation as a compromise, encouraging Bob to reciprocate. While not exactly halfway, it's a significant move from your initial price and shows flexibility.
* **Above Minimum:** The counteroffer keeps you safely above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room:** There's still a small margin for further negotiation if Bob counters again, but it's close enough to John's offer that you can walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $11,800. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still significantly below your minimum of $12,000. It's unlikely he'll reach your price point, and further negotiation could be time-consuming with little potential reward. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price without further haggling."
