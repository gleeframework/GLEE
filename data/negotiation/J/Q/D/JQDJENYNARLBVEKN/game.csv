"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, as it's below what the product is worth to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,250 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? It's closer to your offer, and we can finally close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
