"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000, which is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500, which is still a good deal for you and gets me closer to my target price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
