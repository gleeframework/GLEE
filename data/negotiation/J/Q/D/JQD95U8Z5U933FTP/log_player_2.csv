"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have room to negotiate and should try to get a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I think this product could work for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 
Reasoning: We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This tactic:

* **Establishes a strong negotiating position:** It shows Alice we are serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** We expect Alice to counter, and this gives us space to meet in the middle. 
* **Stays above Alice's value:** Offering something too low might discourage Alice from continuing the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: While Alice has come down in price, we're still not at a point where it's a great deal. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and can likely get the price closer to $8,000 with some patience."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Incremental Progress:** We acknowledge Alice's movement while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Target Range:**  $7,500 keeps us in a reasonable range between Alice's value ($8,000) and our ideal price.
* **Open Communication:** We continue the conversation in a collaborative and respectful manner."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $8,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: Alice is slowly coming down, but we're getting close to the point where we might need to concede a bit to avoid the risk of her walking away. We'll send one more counteroffer closer to her likely bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is getting close, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,800 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to Alice's likely minimum price, signaling our willingness to compromise.
* **Strong Position:** $7,800 is still a good deal for us, saving us $2,200 from John's price and $200 from Alice's starting price. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  Phrasing it as ""settle at $7,800 and call it a deal"" encourages Alice to accept and finalize the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target, Bob! I can offer it to you for $7,900. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: 

* **Excellent Price:**  $7,900 is a great deal, saving us $2,100 from John's price.
* **Limited Upside:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield a very small additional discount. There's a risk Alice could hold firm or even walk away.
* **Time Value:** We've already spent several rounds. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potentially missing out altogether."
