Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter his offer or sell to John if he's too far below my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $100 is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  If not, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with a price of $130. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $110 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'd rather sell to Bob than risk a further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a sale to John."
