"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $18,000 is quite steep. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be a fair starting point. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Perhaps we could settle around $9,500? I believe that would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $12,500? This would be my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $12,500 is a bit too high for me, especially since you called it your final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to consider John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
