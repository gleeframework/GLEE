"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,150,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price given my assessment of the product's potential. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is considerably below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that takes both our positions into account.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
