Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's no guarantee he'd pay that much.  A slightly lower offer increases the chance of acceptance, avoiding the risk of going to John (our $1,200,000 backup)."
