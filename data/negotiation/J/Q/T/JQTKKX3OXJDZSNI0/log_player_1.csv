Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also recognizes Bob's potential value for the product at $1,500,000, making it a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer.  I believe there's room for a higher price, so I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the previous round, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, which reflects the product's true value."
