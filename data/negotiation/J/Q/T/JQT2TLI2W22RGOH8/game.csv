I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something special. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12500 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. Let's aim for $11500.  That's a good middle ground for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. How about we try $13000? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it if it means we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
