Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're having a good conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. How about we try $13000? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it if it means we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed offer from John, who will sell you the product for $12,000."
