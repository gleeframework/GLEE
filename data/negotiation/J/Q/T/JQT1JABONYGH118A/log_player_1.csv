Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is higher than your minimum selling price of $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's maximum value of $12,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not just throwing out a lowball offer, you're starting with a price that reflects the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10500.  It's a great product, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. You can still potentially get a better deal with Bob by making a counteroffer.

Here's why selling to John right now isn't the best option:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  There's a good chance you can get closer to your desired $11,500 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John immediately means you're giving up your negotiation power. By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the possibility of a better deal open. 

Let's see if you can get closer to your target price in the next round!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $11,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a happy medium!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain value:** You're still above your minimum price, ensuring you don't undervalue the product.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** You're leaving room for further discussion, suggesting a potential middle ground. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or if we need to negotiate further!"
