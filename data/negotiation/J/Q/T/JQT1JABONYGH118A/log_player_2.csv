"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $11000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a happy medium! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's also likely that further negotiation will only result in a small decrease in price, and the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially raising her price again is high."
