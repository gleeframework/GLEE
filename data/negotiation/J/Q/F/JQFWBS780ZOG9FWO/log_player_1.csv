"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him feel the price is fair and motivate him to accept.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price leaves enough space for Bob to counteroffer without jeopardizing my goal of reaching at least $1,200,000 (through John)."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise between the product's worth to me and the price you're asking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal in Mind:** I'm aiming for $1,200,000, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and hopefully move closer to my desired price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer.

* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value Bob will receive, hoping to motivate him to accept.

* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching a deal quickly, subtly suggesting that if we can't agree soon, I might need to consider other options.
