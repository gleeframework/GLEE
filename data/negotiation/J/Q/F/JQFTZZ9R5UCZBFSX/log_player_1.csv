"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:**  This price is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages a positive response.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and focusing on Bob's perceived value, I aim to get a price closer to my desired $15,000. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the remaining rounds.  However, the option to sell to John at $15,000 provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I would like to counter with a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. It's too early in the negotiation to accept such a low offer, especially since I have several rounds remaining. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my starting point.  I'll likely aim for a price between $11,000 and $12,000 to see if I can find a middle ground.  If Bob continues to refuse, I'll keep adjusting my offers strategically while staying aware of the option to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $11,500? This still leaves some room for you to get a good deal, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob. It also clarifies that I'm willing to negotiate but have a limit. 

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing a willingness to compromise.  This could lead to a deal in the next round or two. However, if Bob continues to refuse, I'll keep adjusting my offers strategically, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. I believe this strikes a balance between a fair price for you and a reasonable cost for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's offer:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my desired price and represents a good deal considering the remaining rounds. It's a good compromise that achieves a fair outcome. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $15,000,  accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
