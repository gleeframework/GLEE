"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in your product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we both get a good deal.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $78?  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $78 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  It's a fair price for both of us and we can close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
