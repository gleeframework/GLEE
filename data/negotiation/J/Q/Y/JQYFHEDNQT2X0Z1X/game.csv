"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is extremely valuable to me, worth at least $1000000, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000, which is a significant discount considering its potential.  If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer lined up who will purchase it for $1000000.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
