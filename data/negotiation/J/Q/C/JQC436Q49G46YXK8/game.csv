"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
