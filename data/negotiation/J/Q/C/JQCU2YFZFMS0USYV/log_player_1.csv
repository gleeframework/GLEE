Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for Alice if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning that this is an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice subtly implies that if Bob rejects the offer, she has other options (John). This might incentivize Bob to consider the deal more seriously."
