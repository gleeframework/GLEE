"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for your product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1000000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's also the minimum I can accept. Let's try to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in the product. Let's try to find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
