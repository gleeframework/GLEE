# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your daily life or work efficiency. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm confident it's worth more than its face value to you. I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to purchase it for $150 today. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. If you have any questions or need more information, please let me know. Thank you for considering our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer.  There's no financial advantage to rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
