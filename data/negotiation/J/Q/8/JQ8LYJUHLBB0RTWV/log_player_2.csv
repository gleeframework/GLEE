Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not getting any closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll offer it to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge closer to your $10,000 limit. She's explicitly stated this is her final offer and is moving closer to other options.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
