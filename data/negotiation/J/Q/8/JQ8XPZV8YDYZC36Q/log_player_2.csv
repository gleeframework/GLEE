Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $12,750, which would be $12,875. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to pay, it's clear she won't budge much from $12,875. At this point, accepting her offer would save me only $125 compared to buying from John.  

The potential savings from haggling further with Alice aren't worth the risk of her not going any lower and me losing the guaranteed price from John."
