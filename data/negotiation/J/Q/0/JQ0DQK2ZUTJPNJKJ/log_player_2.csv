"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $12,000 for this exceptional item. This offer reflects a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth of $15,000 to me and its perceived value of $8,000 to you. I believe this price is fair and mutually beneficial, providing you with an opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a reasonable cost. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a significantly lower price of $8,000."
