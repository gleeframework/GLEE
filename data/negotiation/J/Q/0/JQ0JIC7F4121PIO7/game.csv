"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. $1,100,000 is a fair price, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise that's a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe this price reflects the value you'll receive. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
