"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no point in accepting it. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within his budget. This allows for room to negotiate while showing he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try $9,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to move closer to Alice's price while still remaining within his budget. This shows good faith while aiming for a more favorable price."
