"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  Let's try $9,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
