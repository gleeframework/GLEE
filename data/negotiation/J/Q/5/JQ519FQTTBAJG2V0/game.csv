"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product looks great, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value and your potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, I have a hard limit of $8,000 that I can spend.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your hard limit, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's value and your potential returns, I'm willing to make a small adjustment. I'm offering a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a slight compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,5,
