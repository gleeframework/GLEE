Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is higher than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $125 is less than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It leaves room for both of you to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial price.

This approach maximizes your chances of selling to Bob while also leaving room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price. You have a good chance of getting a better price from Bob since he's shown interest in the product and you know it's worth more to him. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to your desired $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a good deal for you, considering how much you value this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer of $110 is a compromise between your initial offer of $125 and Bob's offer of $100. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him (""considering how much you value this product"") strengthens your position and reinforces the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I can afford, Alice. How about $105 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is only $5 more than John's offer, it's still a good deal for you.  Here's why:

* **Above your minimum:** $105 is still above your minimum of $100, so you'll make a profit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate or even his walking away entirely. There's no guarantee you can get a higher price from him.
* **Opportunity cost:** Holding out for a higher price from Bob means delaying the sale and potentially missing out on other opportunities.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale at a decent price and avoid the risks and potential delays associated with further negotiation."
