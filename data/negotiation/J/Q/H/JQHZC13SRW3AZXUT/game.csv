"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still looking for a better price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  Let's try $9,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $10,000? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",10000.0,Alice,5,
