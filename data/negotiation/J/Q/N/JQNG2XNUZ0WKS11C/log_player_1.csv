{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price and we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good deal, while rejecting it risks ending up with nothing if we can't reach a compromise before I have to sell to John."
