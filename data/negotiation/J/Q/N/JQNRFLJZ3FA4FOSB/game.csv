"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer you the product for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $800,000 to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product is valuable to me, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'm willing to offer $500,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $550,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $550,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm going to offer $525,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $525,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $575,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",575000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $575,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $550,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this transaction.",550000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go back to $550,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $580,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",580000.0,Alice,7,
