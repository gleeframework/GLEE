"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,800,000 is above your maximum budget, and you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's price, aiming to establish a starting point for negotiation.  This should give us room to bargain and hopefully arrive at a price that's beneficial for both of us."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, so I'll reject it.  I'm close to John's price, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."

This counteroffer is closer to John's price, but still lower than Alice's current offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with this offer, as it's a compromise between my ideal price and what I know Alice is willing to accept."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

While Alice's offer is close to my budget, it's still slightly higher than what John is offering.  To avoid further negotiations, I'll choose to buy the product from John to save money."
