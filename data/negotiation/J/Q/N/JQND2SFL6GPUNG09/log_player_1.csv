{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is a bit higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. I also emphasize that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Even though $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price.  It's better to sell to John at $12,000 and guarantee a sale above my minimum."
