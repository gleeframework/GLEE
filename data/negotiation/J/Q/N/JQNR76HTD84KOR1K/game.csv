"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with another seller.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is my final offer, and if you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",9800.0,Alice,5,
