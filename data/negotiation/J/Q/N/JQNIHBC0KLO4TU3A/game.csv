"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,800. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",15800.0,Alice,5,
