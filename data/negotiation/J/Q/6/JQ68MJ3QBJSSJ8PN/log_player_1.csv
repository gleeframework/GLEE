{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving you some room to negotiate. It also emphasizes the value to you, potentially making Bob more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
