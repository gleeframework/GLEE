"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  He has room to negotiate and shouldn't settle immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  This would give us both a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $11,500, he's still getting a good deal, saving $500 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's a risk Alice will walk away, leaving Bob with no product.  It's a good compromise that benefits both parties."
