# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $900,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While $900,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's potential to get a better price."
