"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value as possible without going below it. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. While it's still slightly above the product's value to Alice, it's below Bob's initial maximum price of $15,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and ultimately buying from John is high."
