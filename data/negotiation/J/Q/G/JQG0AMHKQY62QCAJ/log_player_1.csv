Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects a significant discount from my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.
