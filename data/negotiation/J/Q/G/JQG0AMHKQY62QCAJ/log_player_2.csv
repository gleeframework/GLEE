"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects a significant discount from my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, hoping to get the negotiation moving in the right direction.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the discount my offer provides, emphasizing that it's still a good deal for her.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  This price is well within my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and leaves room for potential concessions."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a balance between our interests and offers a fair value for both parties involved.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still above my ideal price point. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a good middle ground that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by increasing my offer, but I'm still aiming to get a price that's closer to my initial counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm framing my offer as a ""middle ground"" to make it more appealing to Alice.
* **Emphasizing Budget:** I'm reminding Alice of my budget constraints to help her understand why I can't go higher."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice's offer is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,075,000.
* **Time Constraints:** We're in Round 5, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While I'd prefer to pay $1,075,000, a $15,000 difference is a reasonable compromise for a deal this close."
