,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $180 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $120. If you're willing to come down to that, I'd be happy to purchase it.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $120, but I'm willing to come down to $140. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120.  If you're serious about selling, let's make this happen.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, so I'll offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  If you can come down to $125, I'd be happy to take the product. Let's see if we can make this happen!",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to get a better price for this product. I'll do $128, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",128.0,Alice,9,
