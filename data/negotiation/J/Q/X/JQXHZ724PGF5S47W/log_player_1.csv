Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
