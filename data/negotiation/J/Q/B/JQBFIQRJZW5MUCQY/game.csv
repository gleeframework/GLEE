"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that you're willing to make a significant investment in it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, this is the final offer I can make.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
