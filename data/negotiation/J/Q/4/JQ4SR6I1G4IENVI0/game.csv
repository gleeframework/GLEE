"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product, which still allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. Considering your offer of $750,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably offer at this time.  Let's split the difference and go with $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a win-win situation.",800000.0,Bob,4,
