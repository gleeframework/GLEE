,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a little more than I'm aiming for. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more offer: $155. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
