"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
