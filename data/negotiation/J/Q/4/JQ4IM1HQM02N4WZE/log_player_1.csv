"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and John's offer provides room for negotiation and signals a strong belief in the product's worth. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a high initial number, we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially making him more amenable to a price closer to $1,500,000 later on.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The message emphasizes a willingness to discuss, which can foster a collaborative atmosphere despite the ambitious opening price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the back-up offer from John. We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is higher than John's offer, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price closer to $2,000,000. Rejecting this offer signals that we believe the product is worth more and keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly unique.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** We've come down significantly from our initial price, signaling flexibility, but we're still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial offer and John's standing offer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" reinforces the product's worth and provides a reason for the high price, even as we negotiate.
* **Compromise language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" fosters a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob meeting us halfway at $1,800,000 represents a significant profit above John's offer of $1,500,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting this offer secures a very favorable deal."
