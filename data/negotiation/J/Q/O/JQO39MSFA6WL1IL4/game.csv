"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this quality.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger investment than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $925,000 is still considerably less than what I can accept. Let's settle at $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, my budget is capped at $900,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
