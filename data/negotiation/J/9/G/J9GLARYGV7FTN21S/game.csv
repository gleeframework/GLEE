"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,750.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.",9750.0,Bob,6,
