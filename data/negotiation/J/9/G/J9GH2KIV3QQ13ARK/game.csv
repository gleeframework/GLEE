"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree your product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and the investment that has gone into developing it.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
