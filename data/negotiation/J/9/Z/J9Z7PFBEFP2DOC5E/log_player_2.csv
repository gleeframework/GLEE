"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob, and he knows he can get it for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a reasonable starting point, as it demonstrates Bob's commitment to buying the product, but also sets a clear boundary for what he is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, and allows Bob to potentially push for a lower price in the next round.  There's still a chance to get a better deal than John's offer, and Bob has time on his side with the 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to compromise. He is still significantly below Alice's offer, but this demonstrates his flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer also leaves room for Alice to make a slight concession while still achieving a favorable price for herself."
