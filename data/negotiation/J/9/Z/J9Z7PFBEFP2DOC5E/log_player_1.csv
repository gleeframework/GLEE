"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a good portion of the potential profit. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  It's still early in the process and I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob will be persuaded by the fact that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price and is a good deal for me.  While I'd like to keep negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price, I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might become less willing to negotiate and could potentially end up selling to someone else.  I've already used 4 rounds and the clock is ticking. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so this offer provides a good opportunity to secure a profit and move on."
