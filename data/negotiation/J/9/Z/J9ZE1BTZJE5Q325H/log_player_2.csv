Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,800,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if she's willing to come down in price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,650,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what John is selling it for. He should try to counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to John's price."
