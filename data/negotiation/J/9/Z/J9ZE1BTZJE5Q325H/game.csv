"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1650000. This is a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1650000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1600000, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
