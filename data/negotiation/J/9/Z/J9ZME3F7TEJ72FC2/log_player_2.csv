"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation strategy to start with an offer significantly lower than your true ceiling. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Significant but Not Insulting:**  A drop of $300,000 is significant but not so low as to be insulting. It shows you're serious but also looking for a good deal.
* **Leaves Room to Negotiate:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's still a decent chance of reaching a price you both find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving in the Right Direction:** Alice reducing her price shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:**  While $1,250,000 is better, there's still a significant gap between her offer and John's price ($1,500,000). We can likely negotiate further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a small risk Alice might walk away, but the potential savings of getting the price closer to $1,100,000 outweigh that risk at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, how about $1,175,000?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($1,250,000) and my previous offer ($1,100,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We want to keep the negotiation moving, and a counteroffer closer to her price might encourage her to do the same.
* **Still Below John's Price:**  Importantly, this offer still keeps us well below the $1,500,000 fallback option with John."
