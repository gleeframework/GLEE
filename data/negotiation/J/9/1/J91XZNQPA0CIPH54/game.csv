"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $95?  It's a fair offer considering its worth.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth $80, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. However, $95 is still a bit high for me. Can we try $70? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Alice,5,
