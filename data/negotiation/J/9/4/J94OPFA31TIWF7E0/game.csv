"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I understand that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
