"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a little high for my budget. Could we potentially settle around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to consider $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $14,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000?  That would work for me.",13000.0,Bob,6,
