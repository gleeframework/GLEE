"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it's incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it can be a real asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, holding out for a better offer is the best strategy at this point. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $15,000 is closer, it's still a little high for my budget. Could we potentially settle around $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is slowly moving towards my acceptable price. However, I'm not in a rush, and John's offer provides a good safety net. I'll counter again but stay firm on the lower bound of the possible deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to consider $14,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $14,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000?  That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a close call, but Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer secures a profit above his initial offer and saves time.
