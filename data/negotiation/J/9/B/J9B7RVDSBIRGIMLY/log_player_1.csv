Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget and my assessment of the product's value. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 as a starting point for negotiation. This reflects the product's worth to me, while leaving room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,400,000.  This price would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and further negotiation risks losing John's offer. It makes more business sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
