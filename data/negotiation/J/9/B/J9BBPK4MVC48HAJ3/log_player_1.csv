Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below the value to Bob. This strategy aims to maximize my profits while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to me is high, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $750,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While $750,000 is still a good amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this price is still attractive to you considering the product's value, and it allows me to reach a fair outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline. Considering the value I place on the product, I am unable to agree to $850,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting it ensures I get my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer or a complete breakdown. While I would have liked to earn more, I can secure a satisfactory outcome now."
