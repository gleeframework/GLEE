Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
 
This strategy starts with a price higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This approach aims to find a compromise. It signals a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price closer to your desired range.
* **Above your minimum:**  $13,000 is still a profitable price for you.
* **Testing Bob's flexibility:** This counteroffer will reveal how much Bob is truly willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $11,500 is above your minimum selling price of $12,000, securing you a profit.
* **Stronger negotiating position:** Bob increased his offer significantly from $10,000 to $11,500, showing he's serious and flexible. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Pushing further risks alienating Bob. He might walk away, leaving you to accept John's offer at your minimum. 

It's better to accept a good offer now than risk getting a worse outcome later."
