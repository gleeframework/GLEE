Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $1,250,000, and you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Cut your losses and buy from John."
