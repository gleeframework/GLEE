Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and allows me to potentially get a higher profit than my minimum threshold.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is above my minimum threshold, I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to drop below a certain price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I hoped, it's above my minimum threshold and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher. Selling to John would only net me $1,200,000, so accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a higher profit."
