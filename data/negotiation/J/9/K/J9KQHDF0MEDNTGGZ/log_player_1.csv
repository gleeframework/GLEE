Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  By setting this price, I am setting the tone that I am confident in the product's value and am aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $800,000 for the product. I think it's a bit steep at $1,200,000. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum price. It's best to reject his offer and proceed with a counteroffer of my own.  I want to maintain a strong negotiating position and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price still allows you a significant gain as you value the product at $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still very good for me."
