Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and could greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to discussing how we can find a mutually agreeable price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, but I'm not comfortable going any higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and my initial asking price. While I want to find a compromise, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 would be premature. I have room to negotiate and gauge his willingness to move closer to a price that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $850,000 is considerably below its true worth and my initial offer was a good-faith attempt to find a middle ground. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I am lowering my price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but not too drastically. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to incentivize him to increase his offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer keeps me well above his current offer while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product, and I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't find a price point closer to my valuation. I'll continue negotiating, but selling to John is looking more and more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I need to see a more substantial increase to continue this conversation. I'm willing to consider $1,600,000 as my final offer. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm serious about my minimum acceptable price.
* **Significant Concession, But Above Reserve:**  I'm dropping the price considerably to entice Bob while still staying well above my absolute bottom line ($1,500,000).
* **Shifting Focus:** I'm emphasizing this price is my bottom line and moving away from further rounds of back and forth. This subtly prepares Bob for either accepting this offer or the negotiation ending."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Bridge the Gap:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum ($1,500,000). We're entering the later rounds, and his incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to meet my valuation. 
* **John is a Sure Thing:** I have a guaranteed offer for my minimum acceptable price from John. There's no risk in accepting his offer.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has diminishing returns. Accepting John's offer allows me to move forward and potentially pursue other deals."
