"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, but I'm not comfortable going any higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $850,000 is considerably below its true worth and my initial offer was a good-faith attempt to find a middle ground. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product, and I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I need to see a more substantial increase to continue this conversation.
