Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's favorable for both of us. I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for potential profit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,300,000 is a good deal considering we are already in round 4 and the risk of losing the deal entirely.  I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away or lower his offer further, potentially bringing us closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's better to secure a deal that's slightly below my target but still brings a good profit."
