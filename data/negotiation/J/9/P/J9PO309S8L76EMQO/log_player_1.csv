Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without you feeling pressured to accept a low price. 
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer attractive to him, increasing the chances of him accepting. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially make a few concessions if needed without compromising your goal of earning a high price.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I want to try and secure a higher price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. It shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but am not desperate to accept his first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'd rather continue negotiating for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, but it's closer to my initial offer than Bob's last one. It shows Bob that I am willing to move, but also that I believe the product is worth more. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come up with a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm starting to feel like the negotiations are going nowhere. The price is not moving as quickly as I would like, and I'm concerned it might continue to stall.  Selling to John at least guarantees me my minimum.  I can't risk continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with less than that."
