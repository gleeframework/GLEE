"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while staying within a reasonable range that Bob is likely to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, it's not ideal. I want to see if I can get a higher offer from Bob. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,800 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely that Bob will offer a higher price.  Instead, I'll sell to John for $8,000 and avoid further haggling.  This guarantees me my minimum price and saves time."
