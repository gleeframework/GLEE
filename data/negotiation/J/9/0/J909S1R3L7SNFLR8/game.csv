,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $990,000, but that's my absolute final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product.",990000.0,Bob,8,
