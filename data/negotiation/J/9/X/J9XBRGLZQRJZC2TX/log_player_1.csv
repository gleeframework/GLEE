I've been trying to negotiate with Bob, but he's not budging.  We only have two rounds left, and I'm concerned we won't be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid risking losing out on a sale altogether, I'm going to accept John's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with the product."
