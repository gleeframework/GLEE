"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  That way we're both a little closer to what we want.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting very close now! I'm willing to come down to $795,000.  I really do think this product is worth more, but I want to make this deal happen.  What do you say?",795000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're very close! I can go up to $792,500. That's splitting the difference, and I think it's more than fair.",792500.0,Bob,8,
