"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move forward, I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential return on investment for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $750,000 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept.  Let's try to find a sweet spot - would you consider $1,000,000? This is my firm bottom line to make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we're getting closer.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is the highest I can go. Let me know if it works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
