Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While continuing to negotiate is an option, it's risky, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  Instead, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This ensures I acquire the product while staying within my budget."
