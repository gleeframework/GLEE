Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession to $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down further, and getting the product for $1,000,000 from John is a guaranteed win. There's no point in further negotiation with Alice."
