It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially save a lot of money by doing so."

This is a significant counteroffer, showing Alice you're serious about getting a good deal. It's a substantial drop from her initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further before settling on her offer or buying from John."

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's last offer, but still below the $1,000,000 price you'd pay for John. This shows you're willing to meet halfway, increasing the chance of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is only $50,000 less than John's price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation.  It's time to buy from John and be done with it."
