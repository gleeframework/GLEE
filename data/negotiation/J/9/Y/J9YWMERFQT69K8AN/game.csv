"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $700,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value it brings to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
