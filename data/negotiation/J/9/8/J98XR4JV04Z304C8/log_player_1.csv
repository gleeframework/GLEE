"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a higher price before moving closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $98. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, and I hope it will be enough to convince him to close the deal.  We are getting close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $88. While it's closer to my minimum, it's still a better deal than selling to John.  The negotiations have been going on for a while, and I want to close the deal before we run out of rounds."
