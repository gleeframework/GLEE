"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe that reflects the true value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $1,900,000. How about $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Bob,4,
