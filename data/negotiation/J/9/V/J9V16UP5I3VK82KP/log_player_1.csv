Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is closer to our desired range, we still have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to go higher than his initial valuation. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe that reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Justification:**  We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This tactic can feel fair to both parties and potentially lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,800,000 and $1,900,000. How about $1,850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,850,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our price range, indicating a strong desire to purchase. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us pushing him away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
