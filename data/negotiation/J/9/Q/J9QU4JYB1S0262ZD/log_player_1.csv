"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation but still gets me a decent profit.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will realize that he's getting a good deal at this price and will be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only $2 above my minimum, it's still a profit and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's better than selling to John for $80."
