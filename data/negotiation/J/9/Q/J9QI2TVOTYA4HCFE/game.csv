"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront - $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to agree to $11,800, but that's my final offer.  This offer stands for this round only; if not accepted, I'll have to consider other options.",11800.0,Alice,5,
