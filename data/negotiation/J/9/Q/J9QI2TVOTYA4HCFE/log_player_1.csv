Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $10,000? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront - $11,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could be persuaded to agree to $11,800, but that's my final offer.  This offer stands for this round only; if not accepted, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11800}"
