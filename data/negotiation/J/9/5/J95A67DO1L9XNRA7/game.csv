"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, taking into account the value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and it's a significant step closer to my budget. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
