Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000.  This is a price higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but it allows for some negotiation room. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum value.  This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while providing a reasonable offer to Bob."
