{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to get a good deal. If he rejects it, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $120. It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price guaranteed."
