,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting a fair price based on my evaluation of its worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective and offer. I've given this some further thought, and to be candid, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities and potential for your specific needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my understanding of the value it brings while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to lower your price. However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant amount for me, and reflects a more realistic value for the product given my needs. Let's work towards a compromise.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I propose a final price of $1,650,000. I believe this fairly reflects the value this product brings to your operations while recognizing your budget considerations.  This offer stands, but I need a decision soon as I have other interested parties.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a quick decision, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000. This represents a substantial investment for me and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
