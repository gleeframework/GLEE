"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's crucial to start negotiating and try to lower the price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and initiate the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you sharing your perspective and offer. I've given this some further thought, and to be candid, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities and potential for your specific needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects my understanding of the value it brings while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's budget. While it shows Alice is willing to negotiate, it's still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to lower your price. However, $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a significant amount for me, and reflects a more realistic value for the product given my needs. Let's work towards a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. I've carefully considered your latest offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I propose a final price of $1,650,000. I believe this fairly reflects the value this product brings to your operations while recognizing your budget considerations.  This offer stands, but I need a decision soon as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,650,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his target price.  There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price. It's important to remember that Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a quick decision, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,500,000.
