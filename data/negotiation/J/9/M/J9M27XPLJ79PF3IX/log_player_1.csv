"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price ($2,000,000) knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept on the first offer. This allows me to start the negotiation with a strong position.
* **Setting the Stage:**  I'm using friendly language to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the product's worth to me (""worth a lot to me"") to subtly imply its potential value to Bob. 

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and understanding of the product's potential value. This first round is about getting the negotiation started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's good to see he's interested, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price this early in the negotiation.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,200,000 is a bit too far off from what I need to sell the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This still reflects the value of the product to me, but it's a step closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Maintain Value:**  I reiterate that the product has value to me, reminding Bob of its potential worth.
* **Seek Common Ground:**  I encourage Bob to consider a meeting point, suggesting a more collaborative approach.

By taking a step towards Bob's offer, I aim to encourage him to come up a bit in his next counteroffer, hopefully bringing us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1750000. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 I'm comfortable with. I'm not willing to settle for less than the minimum value I've set for the product. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to see if I can nudge him closer to my price point.  I'm still confident I can secure a better deal with him or, if necessary, move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're not comfortable with $1,750,000. I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the true value of this product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm lowering the price again to show Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Set a Deadline:** I'm making it clear that this is my ""final offer"" before I consider other options, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Appeal to Reason:**  I'm reminding Bob that the price still reflects the ""true value"" of the product, hoping to appeal to his sense of fairness.

By emphasizing my commitment to reaching an agreement and setting a deadline, I'm aiming to push Bob towards a decision in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've gone through several rounds, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much closer to my desired price.  

Rather than continue negotiating with Bob and potentially risk losing more time and ending up with a worse deal, I've decided to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation that might lead to a lower final amount."
