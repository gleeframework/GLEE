"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to accept it immediately. You can reject the offer and still get the product from John for the same price. This strategy allows you to see if Alice might be willing to lower the price if she wants to sell the product to you."
