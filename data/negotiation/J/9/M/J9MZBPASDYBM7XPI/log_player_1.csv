Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,190,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming high initially is a strategic move."
