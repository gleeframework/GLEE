Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you're very interested in. Given its unique value, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its significance while also recognizing your potential gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering it at Bob's maximum value is risky, as he might try to negotiate lower. Setting it slightly lower increases the chance of acceptance.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will pay $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to go below that price.

**The message aims to:**

* **Be polite and professional.**
* **Highlight the product's value.**
* **Subtly imply the price is fair** by referencing ""potential gain."" 

This offer gives Alice a strong chance of securing a price significantly higher than her minimum while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
