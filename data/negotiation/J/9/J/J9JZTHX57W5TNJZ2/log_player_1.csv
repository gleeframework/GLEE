"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price than what John is offering."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still significantly higher than John's offer, but it's a concession from my initial offer. Hopefully, this will show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to give away the product for cheap."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,250,000. We're nearing the end of the rounds, so I want to be more aggressive in getting Bob to accept.  It's still a good profit, and hopefully, he'll agree to it rather than risk losing the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We are running out of rounds, and Bob's last offer was only $50,000 more than what John is offering.  It's not worth risking the deal for a small increase in price at this point."
