"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm raising my price a bit to $14,000. This gives Bob a chance to come up slightly, and it also shows him that I'm not desperate to sell. I want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway at $13,500.  This shows I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not going to accept his last offer, which was too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm getting a little nervous about running out of rounds.  Bob's offer of $12,750 is only $750 below my minimum price and is probably the best offer I'm going to get.  I'm going to accept it and secure the deal."
