"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  This price reflects its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
