"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,350,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,275,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain from this product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
