Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll aim for a counter-offer closer to my initial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,250,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,350,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,275,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe the product is worth more than $1,275,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks again for working with me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close this deal soon.  How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing this deal.  Selling to John would result in a lower profit. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a sale."
