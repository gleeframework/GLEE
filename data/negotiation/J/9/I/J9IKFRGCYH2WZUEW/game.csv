"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
