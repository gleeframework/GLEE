"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget. Could you do $9,500? That would work for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. It's the best I can do, let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
