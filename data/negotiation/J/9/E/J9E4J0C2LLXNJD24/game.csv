"Alice, $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly holds a lot of value, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
