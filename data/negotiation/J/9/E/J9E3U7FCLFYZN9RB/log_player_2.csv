"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price given its potential.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating that you are serious about negotiating. $1,200,000 is still a decent amount to pay, but it leaves some room for further negotiation if needed. This counteroffer also opens the door for a discussion about the value proposition and potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it still reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your maximum budget and higher than what you'd pay John. There's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this figure."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Alice you're serious about buying but also sticking to your budget.  $1,400,000 is close enough to your max price that it might entice Alice, while still leaving some room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm still a little higher than your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This is a fair price given the product's value, and it's also within my minimum acceptable range. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this figure. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but $1,550,000 is still slightly higher than what you'd pay John. There's a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal with Alice. Rejecting this offer allows you to see if Alice will come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price that aligns with my budget and allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this number."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your absolute maximum, making it clear to Alice that you're serious about closing the deal but have no more room for negotiation. Since it's the same price as buying from John, it's a solid offer that potentially saves Alice some time and effort."
