,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $2000000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $1400000. This is a fair price that's within my budget and allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this figure.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm still a little higher than your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This is a fair price given the product's value, and it's also within my minimum acceptable range. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this figure.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price that aligns with my budget and allows us to close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this number.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
