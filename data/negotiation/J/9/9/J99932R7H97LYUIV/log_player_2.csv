# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.

This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise between our initial offers.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could potentially continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower.  Accepting the offer at $11,250 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000."
