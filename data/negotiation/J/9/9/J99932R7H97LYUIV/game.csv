"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This price is still well within your profit margin and allows for a fair transaction for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise between our initial offers.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. ",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
