Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering the quality of the product and your interest in it, I think $107.50 would be a reasonable price for both of us. This is slightly above your offer but still within a fair range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit and is unlikely to go much lower. At $107.50, the price is reasonable and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer."
