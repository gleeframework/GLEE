Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for some potential negotiation downwards while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Strong but Fair Offer:** This price positions the offer as a win-win. Bob gets a $1,000 discount from his perceived value, and I earn a significant profit above my minimum. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* Bob doesn't know my minimum price, so starting high is advantageous.
* This strategy assumes I don't have time to engage in lengthy negotiations with Bob. If I had more time, I might start even higher."
