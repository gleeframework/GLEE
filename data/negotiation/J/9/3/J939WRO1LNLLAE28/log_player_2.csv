Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Alice is unlikely to go below $13,500 and I can get the product for $12,000 from John. It's better to take the guaranteed savings."
