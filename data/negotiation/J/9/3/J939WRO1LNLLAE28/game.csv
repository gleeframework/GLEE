"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings to your life.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,5,
