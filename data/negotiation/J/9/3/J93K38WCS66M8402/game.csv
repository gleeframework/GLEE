"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me, but still gives you a good price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,300,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $1,325,000. It's a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1,337,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us and I believe it's the best we can do.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
