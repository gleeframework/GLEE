Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and my target, so I'll offer $812,500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we'd ideally like to get closer to $875,000, Bob has now presented his ""final offer.""  It's a common negotiation tactic, but it also suggests he's getting firm on his price.  Accepting $812,500 is a significant profit above our $800,000 alternative, and continuing to push risks him walking away entirely."
