"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This initial offer is high enough that I can potentially lower it during the negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I could accept it and make a small profit, I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. 

I have 9 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price, so rejecting Bob's offer at this point is the most strategically advantageous option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand your position, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** My counteroffer is $11,000, a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Reasoning:**  I explain my counteroffer by acknowledging Bob's position while highlighting the value of the product.
* **Staying positive:** The message maintains a positive tone, focusing on finding common ground and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired range. I have several rounds left to negotiate and potentially achieve a higher price. Additionally, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a significant profit. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate is the most strategic choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your continued interest. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500), showing a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** The message highlights the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making the offer appear more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions, while still leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9750 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired range.  With several rounds left, I'm confident I can achieve a higher price.  Additionally, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, guaranteeing a much larger profit. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate is the most strategic decision at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9750 is still a bit too low for me. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($10,250) and Bob's offer ($9,750). This demonstrates a strong willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product, suggesting that $10,000 is a fair reflection of its worth.
* **Closing the deal:** The message emphasizes my desire to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept this offer. 

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. With a few rounds left, I want to reach a point where selling to John for $15,000 becomes less attractive than accepting a reasonable offer from Bob."
