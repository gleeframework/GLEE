Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum price of $1,200,000, giving Bob a good deal.  However, it also leaves room for negotiation, ensuring you can potentially earn closer to the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but it's still above Bob's counteroffer and closer to my desired price.  This shows flexibility while still trying to get the best possible price."
