"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $900,000. This is a significant discount, but Bob can potentially save even more by counter-offering.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to secure the product within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for Bob considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. While there is still room for negotiation, accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product for a substantial discount and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob ultimately having to buy from John at the higher price."
