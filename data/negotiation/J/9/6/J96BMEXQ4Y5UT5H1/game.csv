"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to secure the product within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,
