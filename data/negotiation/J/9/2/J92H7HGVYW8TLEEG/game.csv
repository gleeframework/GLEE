"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering I'm willing to buy from you directly and avoid the added cost of going through John.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you directly. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
