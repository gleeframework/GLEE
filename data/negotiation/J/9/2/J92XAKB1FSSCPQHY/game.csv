"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
