Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  The offer is higher than Bob's valuation, giving you the potential to earn closer to your desired price.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter, allowing for a potential middle ground.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** You can always choose to stop negotiating and sell to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even below my minimum threshold. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me.  

Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to:

* **Make a counteroffer:** I can attempt to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to make this deal happen.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
