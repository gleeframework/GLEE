"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a counteroffer that's closer to my target.  I'm also trying to emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is there any wiggle room in the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if there's any room for negotiation.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is definitely on the lower end, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more like $12500. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can squeeze a little more out of Bob. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from your offer. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This price is still very fair considering the product's value. Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but with only 4 rounds left, I think it's time to secure the deal.  $12,750 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still above my minimum. I'd rather lock in this price than risk losing Bob entirely or having to settle for the same amount with John."
