"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $8000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. $8000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to let it go for $11500. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in buying this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still below what I need to consider selling. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $10500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
