"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $825,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm confident this is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $775,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it represents a good value for you. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
