"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I understand you're willing to pay $92, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can sell the product to you for $97. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",97.0,Alice,5,
