{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. However, it's also lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept.  I'm eager to see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $115 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $105 just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counter his offer and try to find a price that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit, which is ultimately my goal."
