"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit margin above my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $130. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a profit for me."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$90 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to try one last counteroffer at $125. This is my absolute minimum, but I hope Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are still too low. I've already lowered my price as much as I can. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
