# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than the value of the product to you ($1,500,000). It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I do see its potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly above your valuation of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but it's getting closer to my target price. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  I'm willing to pay up to $1,050,000, but I think I can get Alice down to that price with some more back-and-forth."
