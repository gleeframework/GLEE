Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be of great value to you. Considering its potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. "",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy:**

The offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price. 

* By offering it slightly below Bob's valuation, there's a strong chance he'll accept, netting you a substantial profit above your minimum. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with the guaranteed sale to John."
