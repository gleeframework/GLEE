"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
