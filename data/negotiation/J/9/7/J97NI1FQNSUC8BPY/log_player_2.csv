# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While I could try for a lower price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $775,000. This price represents a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000 price and is within my budget. It's time to accept and secure a good deal."
