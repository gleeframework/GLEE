"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
