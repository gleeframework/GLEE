"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, reflecting the significant value it brings. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a good starting point for us to discuss the price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I acknowledge your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I feel is a fair price reflecting the significant value you'll gain. Let's continue to find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This offer shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,6,
