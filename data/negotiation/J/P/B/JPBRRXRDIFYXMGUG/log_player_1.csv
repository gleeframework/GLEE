Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, reflecting the significant value it brings. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a good starting point for us to discuss the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I acknowledge your perspective, I believe the product's value justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I feel is a fair price reflecting the significant value you'll gain. Let's continue to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can secure a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the more advantageous option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This offer shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the halfway point between our desired prices, and continuing negotiations risks losing the deal altogether. At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the sale and get $850,000 rather than risk going lower or selling to John for $800,000."
