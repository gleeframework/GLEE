"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14000 for your product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  $14,000 is still below my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, considering your interest.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $15500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $16,000, though.  How about $15,800?  It's a small difference, and it gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 15800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to $16000, but $15800 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $15600.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to hold out for more, Bob has clearly stated his final offer.  At this point, $15,600 is more than my minimum and a good deal for me.  It's time to close the deal."
