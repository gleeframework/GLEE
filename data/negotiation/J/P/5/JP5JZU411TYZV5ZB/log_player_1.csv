"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's maximum valuation of the product is $150, which is the same amount John is offering. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob as it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your minimum acceptable price."
