"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that will surely benefit both of us. I understand its worth to you, and I'm willing to make it available at a price that reflects its true value. I'm confident this transaction will be mutually beneficial. Please consider my offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at its full value to you. There's no benefit to accepting her offer since you can buy it from John for the same price. It's better to reject her offer and keep the option of negotiating with Alice or explore other sellers in the future."
