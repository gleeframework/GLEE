``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're offering, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to compromise so drastically at this stage.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price in the next round.  

**Important Note:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I want to see if I can achieve a higher price with Bob. By continuing to negotiate, there's potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept.

This price still reflects the significant value you'll receive from this product, while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Budget:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget limitations to maintain a positive and understanding tone.
* **Counter with a Firm Price:** I've lowered my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of the benefits.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I express my willingness to continue negotiating to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet your previous prices. I would like to propose a price of $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you're providing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for less than what I need to achieve a fair return. 

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach an agreement closer to my desired price.  However, I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves some room for profit for me. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I acknowledge Bob's increased offer to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Final Compromise:** I've lowered my price to $1,550,000, which is just $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on Closing:**  I emphasize the potential for closing the deal at this price, creating urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  By offering a price just slightly above my minimum, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept and close the deal. If he rejects, I still have the option of selling to John, but I'm trying to maximize my potential earnings with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $1450000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value provided and my budget constraints.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Although we're getting closer, I'm not willing to compromise on my minimum just yet.  I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement by continuing to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since he's already acknowledged the value of the product.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure option, I want to see if I can earn a higher price with Bob.

I'll continue negotiating, hoping to bridge the remaining gap and secure a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find common ground.  While $1,450,000 is closer, it's still just a bit below my minimum. To truly make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This represents a final compromise on my part. It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you and allows me to achieve a reasonable return. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm lowering my price to $1,525,000, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price, demonstrating my willingness to be flexible.

* **Urgency:** I create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is my final compromise, encouraging Bob to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1475000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We've been negotiating for several rounds, and while we're getting closer, the gap remains.  At this point, with only two rounds left, the risk of not closing the deal with Bob is high.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This minimizes risk and ensures a reasonable return on my investment.

By choosing to sell to John, I'm prioritizing a guaranteed outcome over the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob."
