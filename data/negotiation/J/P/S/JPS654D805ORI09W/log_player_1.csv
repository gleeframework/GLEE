{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some room to lower the price if necessary, and still profit.
* **It's a strong starting point:** It shows that you are serious about selling the product, and it gives Bob a clear number to work with. 

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer or John's potential offer based on how this negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is still a loss for me compared to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it at that price yet. I have two reasons for this:

1. **John is waiting:** I can secure a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which is closer to my desired profit margin. 
2. **Negotiation Room:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my target. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a price that works for both of us, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fantastic price for a product worth $10,000 to me.  Let's find a middle ground, and I'm sure we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've countered with $9,000, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer of $9,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Reasoning:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal for Bob.  This encourages him to see my counter-offer as fair and potentially accept.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a calculated compromise that allows me to potentially close the deal with Bob while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. 

I'm prepared to continue negotiating with Bob, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm ready to sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept $8,750. 

Here's why:

* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which is a much more profitable deal. 
* **Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price closer to my desired profit margin. 

I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, aiming to find a price that works for both of us, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're interested, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I've countered with $9,000 again, signaling that this is my final offer. This creates pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Increased Urgency:** My message emphasizes that I'm ready to move on to another buyer if we can't reach an agreement. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and encourages him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Balanced Approach:**  While I'm willing to meet him halfway once more, I'm maintaining my stance that $9,000 is the minimum acceptable price.

By presenting this as my final offer, I aim to either secure a deal with Bob or push him to accept John's offer.  If Bob rejects again, I'll immediately sell to John and move on."
