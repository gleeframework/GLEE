Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fantastic price for a product worth $10,000 to me.  Let's find a middle ground, and I'm sure we can make this work.
