"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is significantly lower than Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate further to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. He's trying to get the best deal possible and can still potentially negotiate a better price.  Since he has a backup option (buying from John for $12,000), there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $8500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob! How about we compromise at $8750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is getting very close to Bob's counteroffer of $8,500.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and walk away. At this point, accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether. Remember, Bob has a backup option of buying from John for $12,000, so this is a significant saving."
