"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, implying that $120 is a good deal for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using open-ended language to encourage Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $80 is my minimum, I want to maximize my profit. Accepting his offer would mean getting the absolute minimum and missing out on potential gains. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob has acknowledged the product's value, so I know there's still room for a higher offer.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This could encourage him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $120 to $100.
* **Highlighting Value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing that $100 is still a good deal.
* **Reasonable Counter:** I'm aiming for a price that's a fair compromise, leaving room for potential negotiation in the next rounds.
* **Clear and Direct Communication:** I'm communicating my expectations clearly, setting the stage for the next round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm still looking to keep the price closer to my budget. Would $90 be something we could agree on? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $90 is significantly closer to my desired price point than $80.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, indicating he's serious about buying.  There's a risk of him walking away if I continue to reject his offers.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, so I need to be cautious about running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price while minimizing risk."
