Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119.  I think you'll find it's a steal at this price!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
 

**Important Note:**  It's very unlikely Bob will accept this offer since the product's value to him ($80) is significantly lower than my asking price. However, this strategy maximizes my potential profit before going to my guaranteed buyer."
