"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This would give you a good profit and get us both closer to a deal. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking of pushing the price a bit higher, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,375,000. This is still a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $1,375,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,340,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1340000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I was thinking of pushing the price up a bit more, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,360,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price considering the value you place on it.",1360000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit, but I believe $1,350,000 is a fair price for both of us.  This gives you a good profit while allowing me to acquire the product.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this final offer.",1350000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,365,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1365000.0,Alice,9,
