# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop to $10,000 for a quick and final deal. This is my absolute minimum, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?
