"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $9,500 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. ",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to drop to $10,000 for a quick and final deal. This is my absolute minimum, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
