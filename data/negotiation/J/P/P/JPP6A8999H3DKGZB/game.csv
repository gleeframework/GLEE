"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to me is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $8,500.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'll offer you a revised price of $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,5,
