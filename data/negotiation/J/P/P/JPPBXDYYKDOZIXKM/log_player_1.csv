"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. This is a great deal, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob may make him more willing to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I am open to negotiation, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $15000. Would you be able to adjust your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Even though Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I still have some room for negotiation. There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to see if he's truly serious about the product and willing to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting, I create a sense of urgency and show that I am not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget of $15,000, but I need to recover a bit more for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This price still reflects the value I'm offering, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is unique and worth the slightly higher price.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, encouraging him to engage further in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing a deal that is very close to my minimum. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price without risking the deal completely."
