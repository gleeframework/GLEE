Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $15,000 is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
