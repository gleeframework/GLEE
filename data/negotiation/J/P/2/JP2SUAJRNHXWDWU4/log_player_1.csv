Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I can move it quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a price that is significantly higher than Bob's value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and positive, highlighting the benefits for both parties. 
* **This strategy:**
    * Gives me a good starting point for negotiation.
    * Sets a clear expectation that I am willing to negotiate. 
    * Allows me to observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly.

I am also aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, which I can fall back on if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.** While I value a quick sale, it's not worth sacrificing significant earnings. 
* **Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially bringing the price closer to my desired $1,500,000.**  
* **I have the fallback option of selling to John, which ensures I'll receive my minimum acceptable price.**

My goal is to maximize my profit, and rejecting this counteroffer gives me a better chance to achieve that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This price is still well below what I could get from other buyers, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This strategy shows that I am willing to negotiate and compromise. It also signals to Bob that I am not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my target. 
* **Highlighting my other options:** Mentioning that $1,350,000 is still well below what I could get from other buyers adds pressure to Bob and makes him more likely to accept the offer.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Clear counteroffer:** The counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a reasonable compromise that still brings me closer to my desired price. 

By using this approach, I aim to find a middle ground that benefits both of us while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,325,000 for your product. I hope this price aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  While it's closer than his previous offer, it's not a significant enough increase to warrant continuing negotiations. 
* **I'm confident I can get my desired price by selling to John.** This is a guaranteed sale and allows me to achieve my target. 
* **Further negotiations with Bob would likely be time-consuming and could potentially lead to a lower price.**  

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most profitable and efficient option, as it ensures I meet my financial goals."
