"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer you $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product, and it allows me to stay within my spending limits.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's even closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a good compromise, considering the value you place on the product and my original asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
