{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm rejecting it and will try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution. How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your effort, but $115 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

While I'd prefer a bit more, $110 is still a decent profit and closer to my minimum.  It's time to finalize the deal with Bob."
