"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. Can you consider that?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I need. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we settle on $11,500? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both move on.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still think $11,500 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,900. Can you consider that?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  We're almost there. I'm willing to go down to $11,200. This is a really good price for you, and it's also a fair deal for me.  Let's close this out.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $11,200 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and it's a tough call. However,  I'm holding firm at $11,000.  It's the lowest I can go right now, and it's still a great deal for you. Think about it - we're just $200 apart. Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I really can't go above $10,500. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. This is my last offer.",10500.0,Bob,10,
