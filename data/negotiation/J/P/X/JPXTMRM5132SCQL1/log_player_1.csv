"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's value to me, implying it's a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** I invite Bob to respond and open the door for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also below my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **More negotiation potential:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to counteroffer and potentially reach a better deal. 
* **Selling to John is too hasty:** While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob through negotiation. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Margin:** $11,000 is still above Bob's offer and keeps me comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Openness to Discussion:** I again emphasize finding ""common ground,"" encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $10,800 is getting closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Time:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, so there's time to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher offer.
* **Selling to John is Too Early:**  While John is a guaranteed $15,000, I'm confident I can reach a better price with Bob, especially since his offers are getting closer.

I will counteroffer Bob again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I need. However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we settle on $11,500? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both move on."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm raising my offer slightly from $11,000 to $11,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a good margin.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm highlighting ""fair compromise"" to make the offer sound mutually beneficial.
* **Focus on Finality:**  I suggest ""we can both move on"" to imply that this could be a good final offer.

Let's see if Bob bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $11,500 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,900. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $10,900 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Time:** With 4 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob.
* **Selling to John is too risky:** Although selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  He's getting closer, and there's no reason to settle now. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  We're almost there. I'm willing to go down to $11,200. This is a really good price for you, and it's also a fair deal for me.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is a strong, final offer that shows flexibility while still maintaining a solid margin.  
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's close this out"" adds a sense of finality and urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Framing:**  ""Really good price"" focuses on the benefit to Bob.  ""Fair deal"" emphasizes mutual benefit. 

We're getting close to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $11,200 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $10,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **High Stakes:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, the pressure is on - this is his ""final offer."" If I reject it, he might walk away.
* **Time to Play Hardball:** With only 2 rounds left, it's time to push for a better price.  I can't afford to give in yet.  I'm confident I can get a better offer or at least get closer to my minimum.
* **Selling to John is Still Too Risky:**  Although John is a guaranteed $15,000, I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob. He's showing increasing interest. 

I will counteroffer Bob again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and it's a tough call. However,  I'm holding firm at $11,000.  It's the lowest I can go right now, and it's still a great deal for you. Think about it - we're just $200 apart. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stand Firm:** I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $11,000. This shows firmness and resolve while also acknowledging Bob's final offer.
* **Highlighting the Gap:**  I emphasize that we are only $200 apart, making it seem like a small difference to bridge.
* **Re-emphasize the Deal:** I reiterate that this is a ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the value of the product.
* **Closing the Deal:** The ""Let's close this deal"" message conveys urgency and a sense of finality.

It's now or never!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I really can't go above $10,500. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Price:** $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Last Round:**  This is the final round of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome. Bob is threatening to walk away. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000. It's the safest and most reliable option at this point.  

While I would have preferred to get closer to my desired price, securing a guaranteed profit of $15,000 is the best option in this scenario."
