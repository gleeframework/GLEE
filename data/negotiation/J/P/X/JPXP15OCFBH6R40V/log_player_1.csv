Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum but still attractive to Bob. It leaves room for potential counteroffers, while also demonstrating your desire to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your minimum value of $80.  You're not obligated to accept an offer that isn't beneficial to you, so it's better to reject and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good margin.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is above your minimum of $80, and it's a good compromise considering your previous counteroffer of $100.  Accepting this offer ensures you get a good price and avoids further negotiation."
