``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $15,000 to both of us.  I believe this leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to earn more than the minimum I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't go below my minimum price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm countering with $16,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum. I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000 and ensures a deal."
