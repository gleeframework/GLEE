Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob is motivated to purchase, and this initial offer establishes a strong starting point. I am confident that I can secure a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 through subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to accept such a low price. I will counteroffer and aim to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to gain a good profit while acknowledging Bob's initial counteroffer. I believe this price is reasonable and will incentivize Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal by counteroffering.  I'm not ready to sell for less than $1,500,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer but still leaves me with a profit exceeding my minimum requirement. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob to encourage him to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, the negotiations with Bob have reached a stalemate. His offer is still below my minimum, and the risk of further counteroffers resulting in an even lower price is too high. Selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations."
