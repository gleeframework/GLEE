Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
