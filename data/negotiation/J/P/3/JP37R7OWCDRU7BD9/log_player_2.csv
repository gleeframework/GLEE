"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a price closer to her value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $14,000 but still above Alice's value of $12,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to counter while still allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her price, but it's still a bit high for Bob.  He wants to save as much as possible and sees room for negotiation.  He should try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $13,000 to $13,500.  This shows Alice he is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good price.  It's likely Alice will accept this offer since it's closer to her value of $12,000 than her previous offer of $14,200."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is becoming increasingly stubborn and unwilling to negotiate. Her offer of $14,500 is only slightly better than John's price of $15,000. At this point, the potential savings by continuing to negotiate are minimal. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds, as there's a chance Alice might raise her price again.  Buying from John guarantees a consistent price and avoids the risk of further price increases from Alice."
