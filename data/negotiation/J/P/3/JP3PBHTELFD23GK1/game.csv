,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $15000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $13000, which is a significant compromise for me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $15000. How about we aim for $14000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and it's closer to your budget",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you halfway between $13500 and $15000. How about we aim for $14250? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and it's a compromise that I think we can both live with",14250.0,Alice,7,
