"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I let you have it for $107.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
