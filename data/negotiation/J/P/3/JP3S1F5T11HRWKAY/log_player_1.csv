{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  This price gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always go to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John guarantees $150, but I have a chance to potentially earn more through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I let you have it for $107.50?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's midway between my previous offer and his. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $107.50 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm using positive language and emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, it's not enough to satisfy my minimum requirements.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer signals that there's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm not yet willing to settle for $95, especially when I know I can get $150 from John.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while also ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Clear and Concise:** My message is direct and focuses on the benefits for both of us. I'm emphasizing fairness and the opportunity for a ""good deal,"" which can make Bob feel more inclined to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** $100 is still a higher offer than Bob's current offer, reminding him that I have other options if he refuses. 

I'm hopeful this counteroffer will be accepted by Bob, but I'm prepared to make further compromises if needed."
