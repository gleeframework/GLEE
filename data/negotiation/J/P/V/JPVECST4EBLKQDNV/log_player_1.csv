Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if he counters, and it also shows that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $100. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but it still ensures I'm getting a price that's worth my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum price of $100.  It's not ideal, but it's a fair price for the product, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'm happy to accept this offer and move on."
