Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,800 just isn't quite enough for me. Let's compromise. How about $8,900? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8,700 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,700 and $8,800. How about $8,750? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is a bit lower than my target, I've been through several rounds and I don't think there's much room for further negotiation. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
