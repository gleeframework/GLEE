"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,800 just isn't quite enough for me. Let's compromise. How about $8,900? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8,700 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,700 and $8,800. How about $8,750? That's the best I can do.",8750.0,Bob,8,
