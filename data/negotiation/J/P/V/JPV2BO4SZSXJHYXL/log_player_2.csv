"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This way, we both feel like we're getting a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price,  $11,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $12,000."
