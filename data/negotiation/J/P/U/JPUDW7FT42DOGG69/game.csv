"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
