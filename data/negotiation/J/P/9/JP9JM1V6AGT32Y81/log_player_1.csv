"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. To kick off the negotiations, I propose a starting price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals that you value the product highly. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it sets a strong anchor point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering at $1,150,000 positions us closer to Bob's valuation while still leaving a significant margin above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while remaining aware of Bob's potential counteroffers and the backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is good, it's still below his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). We are early in the negotiation, and rejecting now allows us to:

* **Maintain Pressure:**  Rejecting shows Bob we are serious about obtaining a price closer to his valuation.
* **Gauge Flexibility:** This rejection will help us understand how much Bob is willing to budge from his initial counteroffer.

We are still in a strong position with John's backup offer, so we can afford to be slightly aggressive in these early rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,125,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appear Flexible):**  By offering to meet Bob halfway between our previous offer ($1,150,000) and his counteroffer ($1,100,000), we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and potentially encourage him to do the same.
* **Strong Position:**  $1,125,000 is still a significant profit margin and above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while we gather more information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting close to John's standing offer of $1,000,000. However, we still have some negotiating room and time. Key points to consider:

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potentially $125,000 more he might be willing to pay.
* **Time Remaining:**  With six rounds left, we have some space to push back and see if Bob will move closer to our desired price. 

By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're not desperate and are willing to walk away if necessary. This could encourage Bob to make a more appealing offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,110,000. This is a significant discount on my initial asking price and a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer ($1,075,000) but staying firm above the $1,100,000 mark. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the discount from the initial offer emphasizes the value Bob is getting.

This strategy aims to strike a balance:  We're applying pressure to close the deal while leaving ourselves a small buffer above John's offer in case Bob attempts one last negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above your current offer. I'm willing to pay $1,060,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is too close to John's guaranteed $1,000,000.  Here's why it's time to walk away from Bob:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but the potential gains are shrinking. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump significantly closer to our desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk that he might not budge much further, leaving us with a deal only slightly better than John's.
* **Certainty:** John's offer is guaranteed, eliminating any further negotiation or the chance of Bob walking away entirely. 

While we could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting John's offer ensures a solid profit with no further uncertainty."
