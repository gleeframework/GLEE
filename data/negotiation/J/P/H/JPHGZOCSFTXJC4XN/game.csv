"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm making a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
