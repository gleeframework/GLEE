"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $85, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $110. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested!",110.0,Alice,5,
