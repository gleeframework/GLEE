{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys enthusiasm about Bob as a potential buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
