Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation down to a price that's still very profitable but might be more appealing to Bob. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to your minimum ($12,000) could insult Bob or make him think the product isn't as valuable.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing the sale with Bob."
