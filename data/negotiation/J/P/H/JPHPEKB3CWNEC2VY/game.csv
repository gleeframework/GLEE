"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I'd like to offer you. It has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for your business. My initial asking price is $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it.  This is my maximum offer, as I have other options available. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting the unique value of this product. This would still be a substantial gain for you, considering its potential.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000, which reflects the value I see in this product while staying within my budget. This is my final offer, as I have other options available.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $900000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to accept that offer.  To bridge the gap and acknowledge the potential of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1050000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1050000 is closer to my budget, it's still outside my ideal price range. I'm willing to offer $950000 for this product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
