"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I'd like to offer you. It has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset for your business. My initial asking price is $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  You'll likely need to make several counteroffers to reach a reasonable price, and there's still a chance Alice won't agree.  But it's better to try and negotiate than to immediately buy from John at the higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This is my maximum offer, as I have other options available. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, reflecting the unique value of this product. This would still be a substantial gain for you, considering its potential.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still quite high, though she is showing a willingness to negotiate. However, you still have room to lower the price further.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to counter-offer keeps the negotiation going and increases the chance of getting a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and you can always buy from John if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in this product while staying within my budget. This is my final offer, as I have other options available."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints.  While $900000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not able to accept that offer.  To bridge the gap and acknowledge the potential of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1050000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to move forward with a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your ideal price point. You've already shown your willingness to negotiate and have a few rounds left to try and reach a price you're comfortable with.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a better deal. However, you should also be aware that if you continue to reject offers, Alice might become less willing to negotiate and you might be forced to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, it's still outside my ideal price range. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for this product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
