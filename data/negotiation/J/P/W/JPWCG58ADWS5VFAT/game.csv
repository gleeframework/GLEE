"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $10,750? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,600 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,650. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",10650.0,Alice,5,
