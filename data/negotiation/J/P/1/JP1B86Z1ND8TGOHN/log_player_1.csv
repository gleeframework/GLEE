Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this shows good faith and willingness to reach an agreement while still trying to maximize my profit."
