"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,400,000, which still allows for a fair profit for me and a good deal for you. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $1,250,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm prepared to meet you halfway. I'm proposing $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
