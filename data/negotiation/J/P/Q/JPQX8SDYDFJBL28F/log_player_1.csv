"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $2,250,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,250,000 represents my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,875,000? This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise. While I'm open to a deal,  $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,687,500. This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,687,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,687,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate.  There's room to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we land at $1,765,000? This reflects my desire to close the deal while still recognizing the value of what's on the table."", 
""product_price"": 1765000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still unable to go above $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach an agreement.  I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now a significant $100,000 above John's guaranteed price. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away and losing that premium isn't worth it at this stage. Accepting the $1,600,000 secures a very good profit."
