,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $7500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7800. Can you consider this price?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'll give you a bit more room to work with. I'll meet you at $8150. This is as low as I'm willing to go, though. What do you think?",8150.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $8100, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to consider other options. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $8100. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $7800.
