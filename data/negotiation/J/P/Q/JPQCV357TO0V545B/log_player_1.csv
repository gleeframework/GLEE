Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made a significant concession, and it's unlikely that further negotiations will result in a price that meets my needs. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is the most important factor in this situation."
