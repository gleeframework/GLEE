Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $140.  That's a significant drop from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

While $140 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is really close to my minimum, so I hope we can agree on this price. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $135.  While I'd prefer $130, it's close enough to my max and better than buying from John for $100. I'll accept."
