"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is really valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $140.  That's a significant drop from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, $130 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is really close to my minimum, so I hope we can agree on this price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
