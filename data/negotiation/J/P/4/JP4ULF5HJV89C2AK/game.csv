"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in this product, but $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
