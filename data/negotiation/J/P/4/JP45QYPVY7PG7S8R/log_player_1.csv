Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little below what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a strong starting point, demonstrating my confidence in the product's value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer.  If he doesn't, I'm ready to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you.  However, $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm confident that this price is still attractive to Bob and allows me to earn a decent profit.  I'm hoping he'll see the value and accept my offer."
