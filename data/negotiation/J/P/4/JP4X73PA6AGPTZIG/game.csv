"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply not enough for me to consider selling.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a fair price given the product's potential. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increasing your offer. However, $1250000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1600000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1400000 is still not enough for me.  This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1550000 as a final compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
