"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Confidence:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's worth and aims to pique Bob's interest.
* **Negotiation Room:**  A $500,000 margin above my minimum value allows for potential negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has acknowledged the product's value and expressed willingness to negotiate. This indicates there's room to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **More Rounds:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I can continue exploring a higher offer. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  Having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me to consider selling.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a fair price given the product's potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's potential value to encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Remaining Firm:**  While offering a lower price, I'm not giving away too much, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Keep Negotiating:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and offering a counter, I keep the negotiation open for more rounds and potentially a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I cannot accept this offer without losing money.

* **More Rounds:**  With 6 rounds remaining, there's ample time to push for a more favorable price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your increasing your offer. However, $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my profit margin.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate that the product is worth more than Bob's current offer, making it clear that I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I highlight that a compromise will benefit both parties. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and offering a counter, I keep the negotiation open and maintain the pressure to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1600000 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.

* **More Rounds:** With 4 rounds remaining, I have enough time to try and push for a price closer to my minimum.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still not enough for me.  This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 as a final compromise.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds left, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept the offer.
* **John's Offer:**  Knowing I have a backup offer of $1,500,000 gives me the confidence to push for a price just above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation window is closing.  There's a high risk that Bob will continue to offer less than my minimum acceptable value.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees that I achieve my minimum goal and don't lose any money.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's safer to take the guaranteed deal than risk losing more time and potential profit.
* **No Significant Gains:** Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is only $50,000 more than his previous offer. This indicates limited room for further negotiation, and the potential gains don't justify the risk."
