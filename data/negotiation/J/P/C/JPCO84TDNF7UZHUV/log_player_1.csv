Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is above your minimum value of $15,000. It leaves room for negotiation but is still a decent starting price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to pique Bob's interest. It also highlights the potential value of the product to Bob.

**Why this approach?**

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize your potential earnings:**  Starting with a higher price gives you room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  The message is open-ended and encourages Bob to respond, giving you an idea of his potential interest level.
* **Set the tone:**  The friendly and positive tone creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy depending on Bob's response and his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only afford to pay up to $8000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for you.  

**Why reject and counteroffer?**

* **Potential for better price:**  While Bob's initial offer is low, he has expressed interest. This means there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Test Bob's limits:**  A counteroffer will give you a better understanding of Bob's budget and willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep options open:**  Rejecting this offer doesn't mean you're committed to selling to Bob. You can still choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next steps:**

You'll need to carefully consider your counteroffer to Bob.  It should be higher than $8,000 but lower than your initial $20,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to negotiate, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's initial offer but is still lower than your initial asking price.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer and expresses a willingness to negotiate. It also highlights the value proposition of the product to justify the counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** Offering $12,000 demonstrates your willingness to meet Bob halfway, signaling that you're serious about making a deal. 

**Why this approach?**

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain negotiation leverage:** The counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still allows for potential further negotiation.
* **Encourage further discussion:** The message is positive and invites Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** By increasing your offer, you're demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to test Bob's willingness to meet you halfway and keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $12000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now within your minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While it's not your ideal price, accepting it would be better than selling to John for $15,000 or continuing to negotiate with Bob.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price, and the risk of Bob walking away entirely exists.

**Why accept?**

* **Meeting your minimum:** This offer secures a sale that meets your minimum threshold.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing negotiation holds the risk of Bob withdrawing from the deal entirely.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the sale and move on to other opportunities.

**Next steps:**

Since you've accepted Bob's offer, the negotiation is complete. You've secured a sale for $10,000, which is a positive outcome considering the initial negotiation."
