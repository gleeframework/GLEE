Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, I want to see if I can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes it more enticing for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario, starting a bit higher leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested."
