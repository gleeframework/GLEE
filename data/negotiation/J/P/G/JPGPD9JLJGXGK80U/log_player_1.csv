"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my target, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway. It's also the same as Bob's last offer, which might encourage him to accept and avoid further back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offers are getting progressively lower. It's becoming increasingly clear that we may not be able to reach a price that satisfies both of us. Given this, and to avoid further rounds of negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While this is below my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and guarantees a sale."
