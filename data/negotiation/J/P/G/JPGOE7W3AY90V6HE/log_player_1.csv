"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,200,000, you're setting a high anchor, making a price closer to $800,000 seem more reasonable later in the negotiation. 
* **Confidence:**  The message portrays confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe it's a fair offer considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000).  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, it's too early to settle for that. There's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. However,  $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While not drastically dropping the price, we've made a significant concession from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate and move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying above the minimum:** The counteroffer is still comfortably above your $800,000 floor and closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without being overly aggressive. 
 
This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to our desired price range while keeping the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand the product's value, I need to stay within a certain budget. I could meet you halfway at $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our target price, but $700,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate but not at the cost of a significant loss. We'll use the next round to present a counteroffer closer to our target while still incentivizing Bob to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the previous offer. To be candid, my absolute lowest price for this is $850,000. I'm willing to let it go for that to secure a deal with you, considering your initial interest. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We've significantly lowered our ask, now just slightly above our minimum. This signals a willingness to close the deal while setting a firm boundary.
* **Finality:** Stating it's our final offer adds weight and encourages Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Appeal to Interest:**  We remind Bob of his initial interest, subtly nudging him towards a deal.

This approach aims to secure a price that benefits us while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept, avoiding a stalemate or losing him to a competitor."
