{""product_price"": 100}

I'm starting with my target price, as this product is worth at least $100 to me. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.  If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum threshold. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or sell to John."

I'm offering $90, which is the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a fair price for the product. If Bob rejects, I will be prepared to either sell to John or make a final counteroffer."
