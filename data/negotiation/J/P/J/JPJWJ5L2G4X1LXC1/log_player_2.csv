"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's not worth accepting at this stage.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget. This aggressive counteroffer forces Alice to consider your position and potentially come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than you're willing to pay.  You still have some room to negotiate, and rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is closer to our desired outcome. This offer allows both of us to close the deal fairly. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Alice's last one.  It demonstrates your willingness to meet halfway, but also maintains your position of wanting a price closer to your budget."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This price allows both of us to come away satisfied and finalize this deal.  What do you say?
