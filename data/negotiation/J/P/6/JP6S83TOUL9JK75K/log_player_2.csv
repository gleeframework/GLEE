"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7500. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can definitely get a better deal than $7,500 since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice.  Rejecting her offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7200. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if this works for you!

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is a good deal considering her starting point of $7,500 and the product's value of $8,000 to her. It's worth accepting this offer to save money compared to buying from John."
