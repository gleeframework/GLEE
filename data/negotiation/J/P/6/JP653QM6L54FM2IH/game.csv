"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more in the range of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Would you be willing to consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $8,750 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",8875.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I think that's the highest I can go. Would you be willing to accept that?",8750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  $8,750 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle and go with $8,812.50? This is the best I can do, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",8812.5,Alice,7,
