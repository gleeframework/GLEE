"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I understand it might seem pricey at first glance. However, considering its worth and the benefits it provides, I'm offering it to you for $120. This price not only ensures you get the best deal but also allows me to fairly compensate for the investment and effort put into this product. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your collection. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  He can get the product from John for $100, saving $20 compared to Alice's offer."
