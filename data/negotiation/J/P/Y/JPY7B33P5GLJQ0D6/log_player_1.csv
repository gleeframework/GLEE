I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This price is a bit lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John. This also creates an incentive for Bob to negotiate as he values the product at $1,000,000, making him potentially willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price of $1,200,000. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $1,150,000, and it's closer to Bob's offer of $1,050,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. It gives Bob a chance to get a better deal than my initial offer, while still allowing me to earn a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a bit higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price and even lower than my last counteroffer.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price, so it's the safest and most lucrative option at this point."
