"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
