"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I can do $92 for the product. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway, but I'll need to make a bit more. How about we meet at $90?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there.  $89 is my final offer.  If you accept, we can close the deal.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",89.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. That's my final offer. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal.",95.0,Alice,7,
