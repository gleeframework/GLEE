Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $680,000. This is as low as I can go without losing profit, but I'm willing to make an exception for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At $680,000, Alice is getting very close to her bottom line. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of her walking away and us ending up with John's $800,000 offer is too high.  This price represents a significant savings and a good deal."
