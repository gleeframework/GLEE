"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider coming down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $650,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit high for your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $680,000. This is as low as I can go without losing profit, but I'm willing to make an exception for you.",680000.0,Alice,5,
