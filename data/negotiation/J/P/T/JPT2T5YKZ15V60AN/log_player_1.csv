"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1 million. This is a strong opening offer that demonstrates the value I place on the product. It also gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, and I'm willing to see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round.  There's still a chance that Bob is willing to pay more, and I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for less than its true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on this opportunity by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
