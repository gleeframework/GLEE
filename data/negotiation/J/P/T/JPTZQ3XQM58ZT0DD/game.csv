"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10,200. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, I can't justify going over $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,600?",9600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good balance. However, I'm still a bit far from your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we try $10,400? This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me.",10400.0,Alice,5,
