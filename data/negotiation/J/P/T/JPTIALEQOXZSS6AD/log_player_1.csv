"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room:** By starting high, I give myself the flexibility to come down in price during subsequent rounds if Bob negotiates. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is as much about understanding Bob's willingness to pay as it is about closing the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his counteroffer is a jump from his perceived value, there's still a gap to bridge. Rejecting this offer signals I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'll keep John in mind, but I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling at my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I'm suggesting a price that's closer to the midpoint between his offer and my previous ask, but still leaning in my favor. This makes it seem like a fair compromise while keeping me above my minimum. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm flexible and open to negotiation, but also that I have a firm bottom line.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have rounds remaining, I don't want to drag out the negotiation unnecessarily.  This offer keeps the momentum going towards a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit lower than $130. How about we try $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely the gain would be significant. Continuing to negotiate might even make Bob walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now is preferable to risking a stalemate with Bob and potentially losing out on a sale altogether."
