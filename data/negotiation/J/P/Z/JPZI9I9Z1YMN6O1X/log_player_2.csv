Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to sell the product to you, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 was still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and is holding firm at $125.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $120 price."
