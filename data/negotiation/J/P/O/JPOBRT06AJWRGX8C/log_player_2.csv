Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $110. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $110 offer.  It's clear that getting her close to your $80 target is going to be difficult.  To avoid further back and forth and potentially missing out on the deal with John, it's best to buy from John now."
