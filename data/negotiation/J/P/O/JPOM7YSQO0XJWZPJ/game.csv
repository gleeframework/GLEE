"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  I could let it go for $115. That's a significant price drop, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105.  Is that something we can work with?",105.0,Bob,6,
