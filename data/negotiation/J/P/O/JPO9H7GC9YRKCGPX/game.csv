"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $7500? I think that's a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both a good deal.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $7750? This is a fair price that's closer to what I'm aiming for, and still offers a good profit for you. ",7750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a slightly lower price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $7900. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",7900.0,Alice,5,
