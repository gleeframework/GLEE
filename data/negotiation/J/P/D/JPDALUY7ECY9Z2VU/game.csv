"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is too low for me. How about $115? That's halfway between our initial offers and would be a fair deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $112.50. Would you be willing to accept that?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $112.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $113.75.  That's a fair compromise and a good price for a product you value so much.",113.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $113.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $112.25. Would you be willing to accept that?",112.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer $113. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",113.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $113 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go down to $111.50. Would you be willing to accept that?",111.5,Bob,8,
