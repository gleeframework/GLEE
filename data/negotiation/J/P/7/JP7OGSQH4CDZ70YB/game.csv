"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree that the product has potential, but the price is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking closer to  $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for return on investment. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts on this?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
