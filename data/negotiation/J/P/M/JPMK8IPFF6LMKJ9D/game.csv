"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This is a fair price that allows both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $128, which is a fair price that's closer to my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try $129.  This is a small increase from your offer, but it's the best I can do right now.  Let's finalize this deal. ",129.0,Alice,5,
