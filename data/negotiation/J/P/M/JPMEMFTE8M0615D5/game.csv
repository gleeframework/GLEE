"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $750000 for this product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product and what I'm willing to spend. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing $825000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
