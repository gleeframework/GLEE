"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds great value to me, but I understand its worth may vary depending on your needs. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I propose a starting price of $85. I'm open to discussing and adjusting the price based on our conversation. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",85.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $85 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $75?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in my product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product. I hope this meets within your budget and still reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $80.  While that's closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  Would you be willing to meet me at $78? It's still a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with a price of $79 for the product.
