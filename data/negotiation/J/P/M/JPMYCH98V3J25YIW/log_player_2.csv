"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds great value to me, but I understand its worth may vary depending on your needs. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I propose a starting price of $85. I'm open to discussing and adjusting the price based on our conversation. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and you know you can get the product for $100 from John, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $85 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $75?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in my product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product. I hope this meets within your budget and still reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $80 is closer to your target, you can still try to get it lower by rejecting and making another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $80.  While that's closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a little less.  Would you be willing to meet me at $78? It's still a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 78}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to counter with a price of $79 for the product. This price still reflects the value I see in it while allowing for a reasonable negotiation. I hope this works for you, and I look forward to your response.

Alice has come down to $79, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $100 and John is selling it for $100.  It's a good deal for you, so accepting the offer is the best choice to save money."
