Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $85 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit more before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
