Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm confident I can get more for the product. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe a price of $900,000 better reflects its potential. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident this price is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $825000, which is closer to our target. This represents a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $825,000 is a good deal and significantly higher than what John is offering. It's important to close the deal, and this offer secures a profit for me."
