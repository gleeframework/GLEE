"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I believe a price of $900000 better reflects its potential. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident this price is fair. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $825000, which is closer to our target. This represents a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Bob,4,
