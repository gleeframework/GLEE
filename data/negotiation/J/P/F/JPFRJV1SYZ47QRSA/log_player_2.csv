"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also being a good deal for me.

``` 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob.  He's saved $250,000 compared to buying from John. While he might be able to negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional savings."
