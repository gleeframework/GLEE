"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000 for this product.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also being a good deal for me.",950000.0,Alice,3,
