"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While it's tempting, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would allow us both to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go up to $8,850, which is a fair compromise. If we can agree on this, we can close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",8850.0,Bob,6,
