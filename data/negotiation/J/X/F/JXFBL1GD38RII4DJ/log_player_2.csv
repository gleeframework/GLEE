Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  This allows us to both make a deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is still above my budget of $1,000,000.  While we're getting closer, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement.  Given the limited rounds remaining, it's more efficient to buy the product from John at my maximum budget.  This ensures I get the product while minimizing my cost."
