Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
