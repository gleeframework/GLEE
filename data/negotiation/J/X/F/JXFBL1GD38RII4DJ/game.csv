"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  This allows us to both make a deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
