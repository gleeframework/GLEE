"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your operations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than I'm prepared to pay. I understand the value of this product, but  $800,000 is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value. While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 price point doesn't reflect the full potential this product offers.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to make a deal.  Let's find common ground, or I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward. To make this work for me, the price needs to be significantly closer to my valuation. I'm willing to consider $1,750,000.  This is a substantial compromise on my end and reflects my strong desire to close a deal with you. Let me know if this works for you.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I can't go higher than $1,000,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to a deal.  I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you increasing your offer, and it seems like we're getting closer to finding common ground. To make this work, I propose a final price of $1,375,000.  This is a very competitive price and represents a significant movement on my end.  Let's close this deal!",1375000.0,Alice,7,
