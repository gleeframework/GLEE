Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
