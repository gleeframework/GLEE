"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, considering its value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still some room to negotiate. Bob should reject this offer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $800,000, which would give you a good profit margin and still represent a significant saving for me.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $815,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $815,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant saving for Bob compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much lower price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
