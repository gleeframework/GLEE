Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $130 for this product. It's a really great deal at that price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $130, and we have a guaranteed option at $120 with John.  We've negotiated a good discount, but sometimes the best deals come from knowing when to walk away."
