"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point. I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, as the product is worth more to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. While $12,500 is more than my minimum, I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is another step closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum price. I hope this will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,750 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I think I can still get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not comfortable selling for that price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to close the deal, as I'm starting to run out of rounds and don't want to risk selling to John for a much lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Although we're getting close to my minimum, I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling for that price. With only two rounds left, I need to be strategic. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push Bob to come closer to my price in the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm going to stick with my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, but if he rejects it, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than accepting Bob's last offer and getting less than my minimum.  With only one round left, I don't have any negotiating power left, and I need to secure the sale."
