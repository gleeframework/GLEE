Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I'm setting the price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts to encourage him to counteroffer, giving me an opportunity to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** While selling to John for $100 is guaranteed, I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a great deal for a product you'll love. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $110 to $95. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I'm remaining friendly and upbeat to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth a lot to him.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm prompting Bob to respond and hopefully accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only John's $100 offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation is already taking a few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing time and potentially ending up with the same $100 offer from John.

**Overall, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice, as it secures a sale that's close to my desired value and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.**"
