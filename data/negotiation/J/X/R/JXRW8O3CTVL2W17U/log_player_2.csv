"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob should try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John. It's possible that further negotiation could lead to a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his ideal price point.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if he can get the price down to $1,000,000.  If Alice rejects this counteroffer, it's highly likely that she won't budge any further, so Bob might as well buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in these negotiations.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given our discussions.  Let's see if we can come to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $1,060,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,060,000 is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to try one more counteroffer, the negotiations have reached a point where Alice is unlikely to budge further.  There are only three rounds left, and the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  Therefore, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John at the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
