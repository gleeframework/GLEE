"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum, it's still a significant amount. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the value of this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 at this point. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within acceptable range:**  $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still well above her minimum. This shows you're serious but also willing to negotiate.
* **Message is friendly yet firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's perspective while expressing your own. It establishes a starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaves room for further compromise:** The offer leaves room for Alice to counter, keeping the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing flexibility:**  She has lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **There's still room for improvement:** $875,000 is closer to your desired price, but you can still potentially get a better deal. 
* **You have time:**  With 7 rounds remaining, you can continue to push for a lower price. 

By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a price closer to your target, potentially getting closer to a mutually agreeable deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get it for $860,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I believe this is a number that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but meaningful counter:**  $860,000 is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing that you are serious but still willing to negotiate.

* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go below $880,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress is being made:** Alice has moved closer to your desired price, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Time is running out:** You've already gone through 5 rounds, leaving only 5 more. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Reasonable price:** $880,000 is still below your maximum acceptable price, and a relatively good deal considering your initial goal.

Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a good price and avoids risking a breakdown in negotiations with only a few rounds left."
