"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's story about the product's value to me is charming, it's irrelevant. My maximum price is $1,500,000, and John will sell it to me at that price.  Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant discount, but there's room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and open the door for a counter-offer closer to my limit."
