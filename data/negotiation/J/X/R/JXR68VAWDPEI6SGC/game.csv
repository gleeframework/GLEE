"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I can meet you halfway at $1050000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another concession and meet you at $1050000 was a good start, but I can do $1025000. I believe this is the lowest price I can accept for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1025000. I've already made significant concessions, and I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 was my previous offer, but I can do one better. I'll meet you at $1075000, and I'll throw in some additional services to sweeten the deal. I hope this is a price you can accept.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
