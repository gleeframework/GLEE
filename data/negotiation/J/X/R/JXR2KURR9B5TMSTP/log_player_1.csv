Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is less than Bob's valuation of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate while still being profitable for you.
* **It's open-ended:** The message invites Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation flowing.

This approach balances maximizing your profit with the possibility of a counteroffer that could get you even closer to Bob's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,500 right now. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** $12,500 is better than selling to John for $12,000, so you're not losing money by rejecting.
* **There's room for negotiation:**  You know Bob is willing to pay more than $12,500 since he values the product at $15,000.
* **A counteroffer increases your chances:**  A well-structured counteroffer might push Bob closer to your desired price.

By rejecting, you keep the negotiation open and have the potential to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Maintain your profit margin:** $13,250 is still above your minimum, ensuring you're not losing money.
* **Open for further discussion:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter again if he still wants to negotiate.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while remaining in a good financial position."
