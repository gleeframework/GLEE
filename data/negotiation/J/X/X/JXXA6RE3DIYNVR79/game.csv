"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While your valuation is understandable, the product's value to me is considerably higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This price reflects the unique advantages it offers and the potential I see it unlocking for your operations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I still think $1,400,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a sweet spot that benefits both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
