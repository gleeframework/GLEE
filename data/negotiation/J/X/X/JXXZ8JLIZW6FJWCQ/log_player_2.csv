You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is within your budget, it's still more than what Alice is willing to sell for. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what she's willing to sell for, giving her room to negotiate while still saving you money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,280,000 is a good compromise. It's within your budget and closer to her minimum selling price.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and you'll end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's reasonable and saves you money."
