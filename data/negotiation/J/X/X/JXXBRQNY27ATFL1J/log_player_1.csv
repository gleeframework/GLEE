Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,100,000. I know it's a significant investment, but the value it brings is undeniable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for a price between what it's worth to Bob ($800,000) and John ($1,200,000) increases the chances of a successful sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation if needed, while still securing a significant profit if Bob accepts."
