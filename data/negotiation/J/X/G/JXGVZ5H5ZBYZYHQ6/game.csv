"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I found that similar products are selling for around that price. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $95?  That's still a great price for a product worth $120.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $90? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $90, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $92.50, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $87.50. I've made a serious offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at that price. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",87.5,Bob,8,
