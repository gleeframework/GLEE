"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I found that similar products are selling for around that price. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $95?  That's still a great price for a product worth $120."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $90? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my target price of $120 by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I will counteroffer with a price that's closer to $90 but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $90, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $92.50, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is close to $90, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I am running out of time, I am confident that I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to $87.50 but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $87.50 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $87.50. I've made a serious offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at that price. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge, and I'm getting very close to my deadline. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, it's clear that we're at an impasse.  To maximize my earnings and avoid further negotiation, I will sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
