"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is substantial and rare. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering the potential returns.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $2,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $1,950,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I need a decision from you this round.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000, which is my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
