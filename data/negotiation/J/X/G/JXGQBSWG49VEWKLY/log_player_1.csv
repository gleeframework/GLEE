Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob still has room to make a profit.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This signals your confidence in the product's value. 

You can adjust the offer higher if Bob shows interest, but be prepared to go down to John's offer if Bob rejects."
