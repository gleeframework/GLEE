"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a competitive price, but I'm willing to negotiate if you have any concerns. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $800000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure Bob into accepting the offer by mentioning another buyer.  However, Bob knows he can get the same product from John for the same price. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer, and Bob can potentially negotiate a better price with John."
