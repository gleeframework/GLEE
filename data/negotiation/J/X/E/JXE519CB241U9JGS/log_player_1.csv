Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $12,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the product's benefits to Bob helps justify the high price, even though it's above his perceived value. 

This strategy allows for flexibility. If Bob outright rejects the offer, we can significantly lower the price in the next round, demonstrating willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is low, he clearly expressed interest. Selling to John guarantees $8,000, but there's room to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $6,000 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** We're showing Bob we're willing to negotiate by making a significant move from our initial price.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price is halfway between our starting point and his offer, keeping us well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits to justify the higher price. 

We're aiming to find a price Bob sees as fair while still maximizing our profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7,000. Would you be willing to consider $7,200? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $7,200 is higher than John's guaranteed $8,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only result in small increments above $7,200. It's unlikely Bob will suddenly jump significantly closer to our original asking price. 

Taking the $7,200 now is a safe and profitable move."
