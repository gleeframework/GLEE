Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,075,000. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you.

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line.  While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small at this point, and I risk her withdrawing the offer altogether.  It's better to secure the product at a good price now."
