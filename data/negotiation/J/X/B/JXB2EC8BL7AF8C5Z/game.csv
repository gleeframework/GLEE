"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see that you're very interested in the product, and I'd like to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking that $1,100,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the best price for this product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,225,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,175,000. This is a final offer from me. Let's close this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting too close to the wire. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a fair deal. But if not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
