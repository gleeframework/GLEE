Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to play with.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You highlight the product's value and Bob's potential gain.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough incentive), while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. In real negotiations, gathering information about the buyer's constraints and motivations is crucial for optimizing your offer."
