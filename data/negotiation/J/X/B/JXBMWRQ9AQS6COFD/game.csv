"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep.  Would you consider coming down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,150,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,100,000. This allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're both serious about getting this deal done. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need you to meet me partway. Let's settle this at $1,090,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  To be honest, $1,090,000 is a touch higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to close this deal right now for $1,080,000.  This is my final offer as well. Let me know what you think.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
