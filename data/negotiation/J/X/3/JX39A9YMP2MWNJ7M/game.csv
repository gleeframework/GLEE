"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we try $875,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
