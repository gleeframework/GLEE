"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and sets the initial tone for a potentially profitable deal.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a negotiation."

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for a mutually acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal while still maintaining a strong negotiation position."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although we are getting closer to my minimum price, I think there's still room for negotiation and I can get a better price.  I want to see if he will come up to my counteroffer of $1,850,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous counteroffer of $1,850,000. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that we're getting close to a deal, and will be willing to meet my offer. If he rejects this offer, I might be willing to go down slightly in the next round, but I'm not going to go below $1,800,000."
