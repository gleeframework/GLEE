"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still committed to finding a deal that works for both of us, but $10,800 is simply not enough. How about we split the difference at $11,900? This is a fair price, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let me know your thoughts.",11900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, but I'm not going lower. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to explore other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
