"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice has come down to $135, which is within your budget and a good deal.  Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
