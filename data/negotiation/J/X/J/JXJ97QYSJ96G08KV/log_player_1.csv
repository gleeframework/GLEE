Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Limited Time:**  Creating a sense of urgency can encourage a quicker decision from Bob.
* **Value Emphasis:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product being a ""great deal"", subtly appealing to his valuation. 

**Important Note:**  There's a balance to be struck. If the initial offer is too high, Bob might reject it outright without attempting to negotiate. This strategy aims to maximize profit while still staying in a reasonable range for Bob."
