Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $180 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $180, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message can make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  Mentioning the product's value justifies the price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher initial price gives me more leverage to negotiate down.
* **Keep Bob engaged:**  A reasonable but firm starting point encourages him to counteroffer. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.  While $120 is better than nothing,  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and can counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll aim to find a middle ground that both satisfies my minimum price and keeps Bob interested in the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This price still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer.  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150,  but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlight value and fairness:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer and emphasize that it's a fair compromise. 
* **Open for further negotiation:** I'm using a positive tone and encouraging Bob to respond, leaving the door open for potential further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $160 is a much better price than Bob's offer and closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By counter-offering, I show I'm not desperate to sell for Bob's initial price.
* **Keep Bob interested:**  A compromise and positive tone encourage him to stay engaged in the negotiation.

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll carefully analyze his response and adjust my strategy accordingly, remembering I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could counteroffer again, the risk is that he'll reject it and I'll be stuck with a lower price or lose time negotiating further. 

Given John's offer of $150, it's more advantageous to sell to him.  This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob. 

This decision ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of potentially ending up with a lower price if the negotiation with Bob continues."
