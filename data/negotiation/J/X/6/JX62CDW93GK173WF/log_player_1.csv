Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob values the product at ($120). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** By offering $140, I'm showing flexibility and leaving space for a potential counteroffer from Bob.  This increases the chances of a deal. 
* **Not going for the full $150:**  Since I can sell to John for $150, there's no need to push too hard for the maximum price right away.  A slightly lower offer may make Bob more likely to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just the first step. I'll need to monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers, if any."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer at $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Time is a factor:**  I don't know how long it will take to negotiate with Bob, and John is a guaranteed sale at a higher price. However, taking the $130 now means I get the sale quickly and avoid potential further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a delay.
* **Potential for further negotiations:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, I'm not ruling out the possibility of finding another buyer later who might be willing to pay more. 

**This is a calculated risk:** I'm taking a slightly lower price to ensure a quick and secure sale."
