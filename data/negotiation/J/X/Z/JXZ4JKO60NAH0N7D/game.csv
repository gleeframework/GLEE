"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit and finalize the deal.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I will be forced to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,
