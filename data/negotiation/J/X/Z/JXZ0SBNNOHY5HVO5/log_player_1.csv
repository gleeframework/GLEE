Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, making this her minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Negotiation Gap:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (Alice's minimum).

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal. Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,350,000 is significantly above Bob's valuation but below Alice's guaranteed sale price.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment"" helps justify the high price.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or Alice might need to slightly adjust her price during negotiations."
