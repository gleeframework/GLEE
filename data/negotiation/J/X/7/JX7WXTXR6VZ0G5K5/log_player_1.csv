Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique opportunity for you. This product is something special, and I believe it could be invaluable to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects the product's true worth, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a wise investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum desired value of $1,000,000.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and focuses on the potential value to Bob. It doesn't reveal my minimum value and aims to pique his interest.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer or rejection. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a fallback option, especially if negotiations with Bob stall or become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a loss.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to recoup my investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still well above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while reinforcing the value of the product.  I'm also emphasizing that this counteroffer is a compromise that allows for a fair deal for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response.  If he rejects again, I'll likely need to decide whether to lower my price further or accept John's offer to avoid losing too much time and risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking to recoup your investment, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair deal and avoids further negotiation. It also saves me time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation process. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale.  Even though it's my minimum, it's still a good outcome, especially since I avoided having to sell to John for the same price."
