Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm setting a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately.  I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  

Remember, I have the option to walk away and sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to be firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price by counter-offering.  I have John as a backup option, so I'm in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum price.  It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, especially considering he rejected my first offer. If he rejects again, I'll have to assess if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if I should just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$12,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. While I'm not sure Bob will come up to a reasonable price, I'm going to make one more counter-offer to try and get closer to what I want. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm coming down to $16,000, which is a fair compromise considering Bob's low offers.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal and will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob seems unwilling to meet my price.  I'm not going to waste more time trying to convince him. It's time to move on and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
