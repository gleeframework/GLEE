Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I am willing to pay $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate and a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal happen.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $15,000 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached my minimum price of $15,000. There's no reason to risk going further in negotiations. Accepting his offer guarantees me the desired profit and avoids any potential issues with future rounds."
