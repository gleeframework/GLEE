"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and I get a fair price for my hard work. Let's make this happen! ",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to compromise further, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product.  This price still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair reflection of its value.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
