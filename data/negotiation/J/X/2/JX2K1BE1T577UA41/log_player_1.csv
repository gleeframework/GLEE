# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

I'm happy to compromise further, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product.  This price still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair reflection of its value.
