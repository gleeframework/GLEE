"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $90? It's still a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is really my final offer, as I'm confident the product is worth more. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. Can you consider that price?",87.0,Bob,6,
