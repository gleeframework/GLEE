"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is simply not feasible for me.  I'd be willing to start the conversation closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits you'll reap from this acquisition.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank, anything above $800,000 is simply not going to work for me. I'm serious about this purchase, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. While $800,000 is a considerable leap from my previous offer, I'm willing to accept it with one condition: you commit to partnering with me on a future project leveraging this product's capabilities. This way, we both maximize its value.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
