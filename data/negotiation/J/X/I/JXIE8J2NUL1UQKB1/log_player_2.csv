Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits you'll reap from this acquisition.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. While $800,000 is a considerable leap from my previous offer, I'm willing to accept it with one condition: you commit to partnering with me on a future project leveraging this product's capabilities. This way, we both maximize its value.  What do you say?

This is a good deal for Bob. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  Bob is getting the product for $200,000 less than John's offer and $1,000,000 less than Alice's initial asking price. 
* **Potential Future Benefit:** While the partnership detail needs further clarification, it could lead to additional opportunities for Bob, making the deal even sweeter.

**Important Note:** Bob should clarify the terms of the partnership with Alice before finalizing the deal."
