"Alice, $15000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $12000, which I believe is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000. That's closer, but I'm still a little out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $9500, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",9500.0,Bob,4,
