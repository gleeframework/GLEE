Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're asking for less than your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're open to negotiation:** The message conveys a willingness to work with Bob to find a mutually acceptable price. 

By starting at $1,100,000, you're leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and for you to potentially reach a higher price closer to your target. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value and also below your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price, potentially closer to your desired $1,100,000, or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
This counteroffer does the following:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above Bob's value:** You're asking for more than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **It maintains your minimum value:** You're staying above your minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **It shows you're serious about the deal:** By making a counteroffer, you're demonstrating your commitment to negotiating a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price and still above your minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and maximizes your earnings at this point. While you could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will reject your counteroffer, and you may end up selling to John at a lower price."
