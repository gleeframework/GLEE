"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. It's a good deal, but there's still room to negotiate. Bob should try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his target price, there's still room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will be willing to go lower, especially since her product is worth less to her than to Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little high on that price, though. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already negotiated the price down significantly from the initial offer, and Alice has indicated that she's not willing to go lower.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer of $9,200 and avoid the risk of Alice backing out or him having to buy from John at a higher price."
