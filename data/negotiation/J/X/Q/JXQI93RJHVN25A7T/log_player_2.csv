"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:The offered price is significantly higher than my budget and my maximum valuation of the product. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to $100."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for something closer to $80."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price, which might encourage her to negotiate downwards. At the same time, it leaves room for further negotiation and counter-offers within my $100 budget."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:While Alice is willing to negotiate, the price is still considerably higher than my target price and what I'm willing to pay. There's room to negotiate further down towards $100."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $120 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you maybe do $95? That would work much better for me."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```tool_code
print(f""Reason:This counter-offer shows Alice that I am willing to move closer to her price point, but I am still aiming to stay under $100. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range of my maximum budget."")
