"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for a price of $1,400,000.  This is a substantial value for you, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than the maximum Bob is willing to pay ($1,500,000) and higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  This means it's a mutually beneficial deal.  Bob saves $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John."
