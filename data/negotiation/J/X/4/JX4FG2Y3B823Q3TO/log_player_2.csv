"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum price of $80. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay for the product. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it aligns with my budget and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating in hopes of getting a better deal.  John is a reliable backup option if negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $85 is a fair compromise between my budget and Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am still focused on saving money."
