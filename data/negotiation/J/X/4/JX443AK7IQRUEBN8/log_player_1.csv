Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so he may counteroffer.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price of $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 if I can avoid it. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my desired $10,000.  I think this counteroffer is reasonable, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not high enough.  I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation and potentially have to accept a price lower than what John is offering.  I'll sell to John and guarantee myself $10,000."
