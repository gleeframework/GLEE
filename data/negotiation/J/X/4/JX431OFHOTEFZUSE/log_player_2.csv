"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 still doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.
