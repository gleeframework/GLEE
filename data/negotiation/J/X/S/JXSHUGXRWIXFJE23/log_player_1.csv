Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer for the product is $9,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.
