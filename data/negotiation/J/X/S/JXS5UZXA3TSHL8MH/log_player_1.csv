Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is less than what Bob believes the product is worth ($12,000), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** A bold offer can signal confidence and set the tone for a good negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a price closer to your initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good move for a few reasons:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not going all the way.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $9,250 is more than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you still profit from the deal.
* **It's a clear signal:** This counteroffer clearly communicates that you're serious about closing the deal but won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could you do $8,750? I'm hoping we can make a deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to your minimum of $8,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away entirely is too high. Accepting his offer secures a sale with a decent profit margin."
