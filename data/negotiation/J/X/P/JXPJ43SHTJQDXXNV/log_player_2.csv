"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. It's too high for his budget. He wants to save as much as possible, so he'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still do better. He's only $25,000 away from his maximum price with John, so he should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $815,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While he could continue negotiating, it seems unlikely Alice will go lower than $815,000.  This means he'll only save $15,000 by continuing the negotiation, but he risks losing the deal altogether if Alice decides to stop negotiating.  Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees him the product within his budget."
