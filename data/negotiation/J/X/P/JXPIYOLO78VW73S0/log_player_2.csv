"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find valuable. Given its potential benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, I can likely get it lower. I'll try to negotiate with Alice first and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll only buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than I'd like, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll try to meet them halfway again with a counteroffer of my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
