**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. By rejecting, Bob can continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to $1,350,000."
