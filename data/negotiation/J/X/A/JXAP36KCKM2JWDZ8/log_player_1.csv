Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  This product would be very useful to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $20,000 represents the high-end of this product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $11,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? This feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 14250}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, we are indeed getting closer.  While $14,250 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with that price. I could do $12,000, and I think that's a fair offer considering the going rate for similar products.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to go much higher than his initial offer of $10,000.  At this point, any further negotiation is likely to be very slow with minimal gains. It's not worth the time and potential for a lower offer when I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John."
