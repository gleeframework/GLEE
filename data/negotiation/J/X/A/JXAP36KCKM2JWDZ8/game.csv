"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  This product would be very useful to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $20,000 represents the high-end of this product's value, I understand your budget constraints.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $11,500? ",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,250? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we are indeed getting closer.  While $14,250 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit uncomfortable with that price. I could do $12,000, and I think that's a fair offer considering the going rate for similar products. ",12000.0,Bob,6,
