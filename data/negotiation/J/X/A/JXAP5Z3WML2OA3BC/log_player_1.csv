I'm not going to accept Bob's offer.  While I want to make a deal, I can do better than $85. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
