Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my target price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefit to Bob to increase his interest.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Starting at $130 allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum price or accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have John as a guaranteed buyer for a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll get. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the product's benefits to justify my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm encouraging further discussion and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum value of $150, although it's getting closer.
* **Risk of Lower Price:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a chance Bob will make another counteroffer even lower. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that exceeds my minimum.  There's no risk involved with selling to John.

While I'd like to get closer to my target price, the risk of a lower offer and the guarantee of a good deal with John make it the best choice at this point."
