{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, knowing Bob values it at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $12,000 is still a significant profit for me (above my minimum of $8,000), but it allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message suggests I'm open to further discussion if he's not happy with the initial price. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a good chance I can push him closer to my initial offer, or at least find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price higher than $9,000 but lower than $12,000.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit lower than where I'd like to be, but I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price in the middle of Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, highlighting that $10,500 is still a good deal.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing finding a mutually agreeable price, creating a positive tone for continued negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, hopefully securing a deal closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $11,000 or $12,000, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000, and there's a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away altogether. 

**Conclusion:**

By accepting this offer, I'm securing a reasonable profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale. It's important to balance the desire for maximum profit with the need to finalize the transaction."
