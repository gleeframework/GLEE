"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's below the product's true value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,000 is low, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $7,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,000? This price is still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
