{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) as possible.
* **First Offer:** Offering $9,500 allows for negotiation space while still being a relatively high starting point.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides leverage. This means I can be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.
* **Potential Counteroffers:** I anticipate Bob will try to negotiate a lower price.  I'll be prepared to counter and potentially reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and even lower than what the product is worth to him ($8,000). 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $10,000 with John. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob, there's a high risk he might walk away. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target but still below John's offer. This will allow for further negotiation while still maintaining a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's below the product's true value to you. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's closer to my target. 
* **Value to Bob:** I emphasize that $8,500 is still below the product's value to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed. I can potentially go lower if Bob is truly insistent, but my goal is to get as close to $9,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $7,000 is low, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $7,500?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's closer to my target price, it's still not a good enough deal for me.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale for $10,000 with John, which provides a significant safety net.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I could potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I'd be left with a lower price than what I could get from John.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my target but still below John's offer. This will allow for further negotiation while still maintaining a safety net."
