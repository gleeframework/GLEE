"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth every penny and more. We're extending this opportunity to you at a special offer of $120. This is a fantastic deal considering the product's worth to you is $150. Let's make this transaction happen and ensure you get the best value for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $120, while John is asking for $150.
* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to spend up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept Alice's offer to save $30."
