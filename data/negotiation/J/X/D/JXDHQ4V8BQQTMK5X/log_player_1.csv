**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly closer to your $1,200,000 valuation. You've also signaled your ""final offer"" which he rejected. Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him lowballing or the negotiation stalling completely. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for your desired price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
