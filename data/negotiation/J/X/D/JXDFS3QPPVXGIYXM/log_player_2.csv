Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have another offer for $120, so I can't go any lower than that.  It's a great product at that price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at $120, which is above your maximum price. It's unlikely she'll go lower. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $100, meeting your budget."
