"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $800,000. How about we try $820,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",820000.0,Bob,4,
