"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in purchasing the product if we could agree on a price closer to $130.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for 145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to make the purchase.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than 140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at 140?",140.0,Alice,5,
