"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $10,500? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,800 just isn't quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. Would you consider $10,150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",10150.0,Alice,5,
