"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
