Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it holds for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob's valuation is $800,000 and you have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000, starting high leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""value"" and ""potential"" without being specific, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion.

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
