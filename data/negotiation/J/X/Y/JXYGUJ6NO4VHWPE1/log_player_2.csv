The product is worth $12,000 to you, and you can still get it from John for that price. Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

This is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's closer to Alice's desired price but still below your maximum. If Alice rejects it, you can always go with John's offer."

Alice is not budging much, and her offer is still too high. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it's best to stop negotiating with Alice and go with John's offer."
