,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product sounds great, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,250. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate that. However, $11,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,100. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",11100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me. However, $11,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,900. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase the product at this price.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,900 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $11,050. Would that be something you'd be interested in?",11050.0,Alice,7,
