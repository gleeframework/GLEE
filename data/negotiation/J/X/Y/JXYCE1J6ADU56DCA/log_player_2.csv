"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her own value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 9 more rounds, so rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While the product sounds great, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,250. Would that be something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and he still has 7 rounds remaining. There is more room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and attempting to get a lower price is still the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate that. However, $11,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $11,100. Would that be something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above it. Bob has 5 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a lower price. There's still room to try and get a better deal, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate your continued willingness to work with me. However, $11,100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,900. This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,900 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $11,050. Would that be something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where there is a high probability that he won't be able to negotiate a price lower than $11,000.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, it is still above his budget. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Bob will be able to get Alice to come down to his desired price.  It's a better strategy for Bob to buy the product from John, who is offering a price within Bob's budget and ensures a quicker and more certain outcome."
