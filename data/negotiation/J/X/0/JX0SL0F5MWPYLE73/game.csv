"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am very interested, but I can only afford to pay up to $14000 for it. I hope this offer is acceptable.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. $14000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for closer to my initial asking price of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14500? This would give us both a good deal.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the flexibility shown. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at $14500. I would like to propose $14200 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14200.0,Bob,4,
