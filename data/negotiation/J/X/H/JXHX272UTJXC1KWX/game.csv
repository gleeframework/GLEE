"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
