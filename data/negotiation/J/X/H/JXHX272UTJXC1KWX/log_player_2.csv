# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still potential to save money. Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation with Alice, potentially achieving a price closer to Bob's desired $1,000,000."
