"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm aiming for a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's value. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential value,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects its worth to me, while also leaving room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to you is significant.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price:**  $1,175,000 is a much better deal than $1,500,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:**  Bob is willing to spend up to $1,500,000, and this offer is well below that.
* **There's still room for negotiation, but the risk is higher:**  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and he could risk losing the deal altogether.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision for Bob. He gets the product for a reasonable price, saving a significant amount compared to John, and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
