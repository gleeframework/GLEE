"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12,000. It's a one-time opportunity to get a deal that's below the market value, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's a significant markup from Alice's perceived value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
