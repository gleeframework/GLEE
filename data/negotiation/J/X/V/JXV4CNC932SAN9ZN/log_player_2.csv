"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $9,500. I know it's a significant purchase, but I'm confident it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is too close to your maximum budget of $10,000. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might come back with a better offer, and if not, you haven't lost anything."
