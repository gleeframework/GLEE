"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can see you're making a serious effort to reach a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $8,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
