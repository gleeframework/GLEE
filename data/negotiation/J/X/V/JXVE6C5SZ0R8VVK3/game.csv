"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I know it's highly sought after, and I believe its value speaks for itself. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its potential, I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly enticing, but $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true value and potential return on investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while ensuring you get a reasonable return on your investment.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
