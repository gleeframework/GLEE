"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally holding at $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
