Alice's offer is still higher than your initial counteroffer, but it's a step in the right direction. Rejecting again keeps the negotiation going and allows you to continue pushing for a lower price. You can now make a counteroffer closer to $500,000 to see if you can reach a compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**
