"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I can do $950,000, is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for your business. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $1,000,000 again. This offer represents a significant value for your business, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this quickly to avoid further delays.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I can do $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider?",980000.0,Bob,8,
