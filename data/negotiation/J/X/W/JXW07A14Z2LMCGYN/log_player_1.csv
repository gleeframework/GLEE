"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strategic opening offer. It's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and hopefully avoids a quick rejection. I'm also highlighting the value the product holds for Bob, which could incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob, so I'll reject his counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I can do $950,000, is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob with continued negotiation. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for your business. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950,000. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm only 5 rounds away from selling to John for $1,500,000, and I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still below my minimum. Let's try $1,000,000 again. This offer represents a significant value for your business, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with. Let's close this quickly to avoid further delays."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I can do $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time and Bob is getting frustrated.  While $980,000 is a decent offer, I'm confident I can get the full $1,500,000 from John.  It's not worth risking the deal with Bob and potentially losing both.  I'm going to sell to John and walk away."
