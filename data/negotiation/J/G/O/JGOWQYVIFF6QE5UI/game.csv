"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it,  $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will be well worth the investment for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $8,750? This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,750 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  Let's make this deal happen!",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget with your offer. However, $8,900 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  Let's split the difference and finalize the deal at $8,800. This price will allow us both to walk away happy with the agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
