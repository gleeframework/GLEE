# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $850,000? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. How about we try $825,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

This is a good price for the product and Alice is signaling this is her final offer. Continuing to push for a lower price might result in losing the deal altogether."
