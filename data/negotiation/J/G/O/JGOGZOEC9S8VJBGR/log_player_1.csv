Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. Can you consider this price?

Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,700,000 is getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,750,000? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable value. It's also a better offer than selling to John.  We've been negotiating for a while, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely."
