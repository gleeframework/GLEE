"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,250 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to come to a price that's a bit lower. I'm willing to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to offer $9,100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given that this is a fair price for the product and its value, I'm willing to offer $8,900. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While $9,050 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hoping to reach a price that's more beneficial for both of us.
