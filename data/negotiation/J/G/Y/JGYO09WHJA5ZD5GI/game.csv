"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm getting closer to your price, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm not able to go any higher.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum price. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000, as I believe the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and your need to maximize your profit.  However, $1,080,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,000,000. This is my absolute limit.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
