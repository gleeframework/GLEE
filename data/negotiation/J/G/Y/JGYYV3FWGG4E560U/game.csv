"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $132? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can stay within my budget.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $132 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $134.  That way, we both get a good deal.",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $131? I'm really close to making a decision, and I'd love to get the product from you if we can come to an agreement.",131.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really want to work with you on this, but $131 is just too low for me. How about $133? It's a small step closer to your offer, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this deal happen.",133.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $133. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $131 and $133, which would be $132.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",132.5,Bob,8,
