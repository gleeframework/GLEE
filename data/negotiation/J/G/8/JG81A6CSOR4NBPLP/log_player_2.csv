"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still $75,000 over your limit.  Since you have the option to buy from John at your maximum price, there's no reason to accept this offer yet.  There's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $837,500? This feels like a fair compromise that respects both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 837500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $837,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $50,000 over your budget.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that she'll walk away, and you'll end up with nothing.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price.  You're better off securing the product now than risking it all for a potential (but uncertain) better deal."
