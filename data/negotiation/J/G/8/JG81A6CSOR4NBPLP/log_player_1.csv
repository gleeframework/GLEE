Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
