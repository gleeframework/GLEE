"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. While I do like the product, I'm working with a bit of a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $98? That feels like a fair compromise.",98.0,Bob,4,
