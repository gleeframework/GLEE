"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her product valuation ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By framing the counteroffer as ""around $90,"" we signal some flexibility while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Continuing the Conversation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, allowing us to gauge Alice's willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down in price, which is a good sign. However, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price closer to $90, and there's no rush to accept her current offer. By rejecting, we signal that we're looking for a more substantial discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see where you're coming from, Alice. While I do like the product, I'm working with a bit of a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $98? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 98
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price that's almost exactly in the middle of our previous offer ($90) and Alice's current offer ($105). 
* **Framing as a Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we emphasize finding a solution that works for both parties. This can encourage Alice to reciprocate with further concessions.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We're continuing to edge the price closer to our target while keeping the negotiation active."
