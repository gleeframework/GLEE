"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high for me.  This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is considerably below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
