"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high for me.  This product would be valuable to me at $8,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable negotiation range. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a much better price.
* **Anchoring:** By starting lower, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired price range.  
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves room for Alice to counter-offer and for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is considerably below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved towards a more reasonable price, it's still above both my budget and John's offer. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I could go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counter-offer shows I'm willing to negotiate upward, but I'm also setting a firm limit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating my ""absolute limit,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that Alice needs to move closer to my price if she wants to close the deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** Alice knows I have the option to go with John, so this offer reinforces that she's not my only choice."
