"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum price and more importantly, more expensive than buying from John. You can save $100,000 by going with John."
