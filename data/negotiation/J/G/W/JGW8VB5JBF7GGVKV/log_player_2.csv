Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way over his budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still over his budget, and he's already said he's willing to go up to $8,500.  He should make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $10,750?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. While he could continue negotiating, it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower, and John is a guaranteed option at his target price."
