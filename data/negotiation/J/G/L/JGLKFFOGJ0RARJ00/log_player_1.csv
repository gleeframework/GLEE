"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
