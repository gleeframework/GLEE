Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product holds a value of $1,000,000 for Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize profit. Offering it at $925,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being an attractive proposition for Bob, as he saves $75,000.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This empowers you to aim higher with Bob. 
 
This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
