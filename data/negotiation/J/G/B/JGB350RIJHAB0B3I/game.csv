"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but the value of this product to me is quite significant.  I could come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this still reflects the true worth of what you're getting and is a reasonable compromise.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is closer to my limit and still reflects the value of the product for me. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  Let's make this our final exchange: $1,100,000.  This is my best and final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that accounts for the value you're gaining.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
