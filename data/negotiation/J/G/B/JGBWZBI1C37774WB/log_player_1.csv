{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's worth a lot to me, but I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately alienate Bob. I want to try to get as close to Bob's value of $150 as possible without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer.  $130 is still too low for me, considering the product is worth $150 to him and I wouldn't sell it for less than $100.  I'm going to try to get closer to my goal of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $135 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $132.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up a bit from his initial offer, and I'm getting closer to my desired price.  While $132.50 isn't my ideal, it's still significantly more than what I'd get from John, and the negotiations seem to be stalling.  I'm going to accept this offer and end the negotiation."
