Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a 20% markup on the value I place on the product, giving me a good starting point for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he has room to negotiate without losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I'd like to get the full $1,200,000, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to agree without pushing him to walk away from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome, or having to sell to John for $1,000,000,  means it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer at this point."
