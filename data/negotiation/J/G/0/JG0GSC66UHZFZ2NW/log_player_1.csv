{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer! I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $115 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $150 to ensure I get the best possible price."
