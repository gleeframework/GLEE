{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price that is a fair compromise between my minimum value ($80) and Bob's estimated value ($120). It leaves room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
