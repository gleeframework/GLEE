"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation room and potentially getting a good price.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product has to Bob to make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Open communication:**  The message invites Bob to respond and negotiate, keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price closer to my desired value. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as an option keeps me from settling for a price I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That's fair considering the value this product brings you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, strengthening the argument for a higher price.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is simple and direct, making it easy for Bob to understand my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While we could continue negotiating, there's a high chance we won't reach a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me a profit.

Selling to John at this point is the safest and most financially advantageous option. There's a risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price with Bob, or potentially ending with no deal at all."
