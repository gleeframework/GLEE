"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and the option to buy from John for $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would allow both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a better deal than the previous offer, it is still above his desired price point of $8,000. Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is closer to my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $9,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  He has the option to buy from John for $8,000, and he still has several rounds of negotiation left. It's worth trying to get a better offer before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we could both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This price allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's close this deal and both benefit from this fantastic product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been diligently negotiating, but he is now at a point where he's nearing his maximum acceptable price. He still has rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. Given that John is offering the product for $8,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's current offer, it's more advantageous for Bob to take the deal with John and save the most money."
