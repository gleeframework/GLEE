"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique features and advantages. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has unique features, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $10,500 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to consider $13,000.  This accounts for the product's value and avoids low-balling.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,6,
