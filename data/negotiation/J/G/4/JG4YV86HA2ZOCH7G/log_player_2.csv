**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but it's still above your ideal price point.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  You have nothing to lose by trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $9,000. This reflects the value we place on the item while still being competitive. I look forward to your consideration of this revised offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to your desired price point and still a good deal.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will either reject your counteroffer or you'll waste time going back and forth. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
