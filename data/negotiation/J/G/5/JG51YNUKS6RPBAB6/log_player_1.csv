Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to sell, $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is still too low for me.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is the lowest I can go.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $10,500 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a bit more. I'll try to counter with a price closer to $11,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about $10,750?  It's a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  How about $10,600?  This is really my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,600 is still below my ideal price, I've already rejected Bob's offers twice in a row. At this point, it's getting risky to keep pushing for a higher price. He's clearly not willing to go much higher. If I reject his offer again, I risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting his offer now is the best option to ensure I get a decent price for the product, and it's still significantly better than selling it to John for $8,000."
