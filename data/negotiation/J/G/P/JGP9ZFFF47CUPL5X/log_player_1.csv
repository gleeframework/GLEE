Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves a significant profit margin if Bob accepts. However, I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low.  I have John as a backup at $1,000,000, so I won't settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, so I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me and hopefully a more reasonable price for Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm not going to give it away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally within my acceptable range. While it's not the price I initially wanted, it's better than selling to John and ensures a deal.  I'll accept his offer."
