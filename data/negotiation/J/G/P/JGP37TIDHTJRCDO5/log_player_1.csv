Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just above Bob's perceived value. It makes the offer seem like a good deal while still netting you a profit.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects, you're not losing out since John is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price."
