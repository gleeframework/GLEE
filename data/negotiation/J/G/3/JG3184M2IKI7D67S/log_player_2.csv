"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This is a special offer tailored to recognize the significant worth this item holds for you. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting at $10,000. While this is higher than her value ($8,000), it's lower than John's price ($12,000). By rejecting her offer, you create room for negotiation and potentially get the price closer to her $8,000 value."
