"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob can try to get a better deal from Alice. $14,000 is still above his desired price point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price considering what it's worth to me, and it leaves some room for us both to be happy."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $13,000 is within his budget and a better deal than buying from John. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying more to John."
