"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, it's still too high for me. I want to save as much as possible, and I have 10 rounds to negotiate. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. I'm interested, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $700,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm also determined to get a better deal. This should start the negotiation process moving in the right direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a better price, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and a significant discount from her initial offer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get stubborn or I'll run out of time.  Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product for a good price and move on."
