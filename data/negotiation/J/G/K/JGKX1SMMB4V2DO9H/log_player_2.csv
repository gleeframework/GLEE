"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value.  You have a chance to potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There's also the option of buying from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above my maximum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price. It's also worth noting that John is offering the product for $1,000,000, so I have that as a backup option."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price given the value to both of us, and it's also what I can pay without exceeding my budget. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
