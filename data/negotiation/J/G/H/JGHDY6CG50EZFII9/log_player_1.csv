"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my initial offer and my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, as I believe I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower counteroffer of $1,350,000. This reflects my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit closer to my initial goal. I believe this price is fair and attractive to Bob, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but it's clear he's not willing to go higher. It's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation, as I might not be able to get a better price. Therefore, I'm selling the product to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a deal and avoid further risk."
