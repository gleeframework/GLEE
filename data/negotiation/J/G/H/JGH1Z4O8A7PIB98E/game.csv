"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $10,000 for it. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
