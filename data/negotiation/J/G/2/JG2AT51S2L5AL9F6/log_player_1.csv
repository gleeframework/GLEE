Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,500 is higher than your minimum value of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $14,500 is lower than Bob's maximum value of $15,000, giving him a potential profit as well.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's room to adjust the price if Bob counters, allowing you to potentially increase your earnings further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is above your minimum, it's still below your initial offer of $14,500. You're in a strong position because Bob is clearly interested in the product, and you've established a lower boundary for him.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a price closer to your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,750, which is a good compromise.  This allows you to still get a good deal, while ensuring I can make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  $13,200 is only $300 below your previous counteroffer of $13,500. This is a small difference, and accepting it ensures you make a good profit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that further negotiation will lead to a lower price or a stalemate. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but he might be unwilling to go higher.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting this offer, you secure a sale and avoid the time and effort of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a lost deal.

While it might be tempting to push for a higher price, the potential for a successful sale at $13,200 outweighs the risk of further negotiation."
