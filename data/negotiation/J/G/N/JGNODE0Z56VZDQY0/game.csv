"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider an offer of $9,000? ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and still allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can make this work. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to stay closer to $10,000 to make this work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's get this deal done!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $9,750, which is a very reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down to $9,850. It's a small step, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",9850.0,Alice,7,
