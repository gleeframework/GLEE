Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the higher price, framing it as an investment rather than an expense. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate if he finds it too steep.  

**Important:** This is just one approach.  You could also try a less aggressive opening offer closer to $1,200,000 to increase the chance of Bob accepting without negotiation."
