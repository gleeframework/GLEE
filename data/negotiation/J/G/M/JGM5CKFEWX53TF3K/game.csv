"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only able to offer $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with the value I place on the product. Looking forward to your response.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the cost involved, I am still unable to meet at $10,500. I would like to propose $10,200 as a counteroffer. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",10200.0,Bob,4,
