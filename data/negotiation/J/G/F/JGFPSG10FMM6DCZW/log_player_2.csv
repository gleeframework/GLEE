Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,150,000 for this product. This reflects its true value and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.
