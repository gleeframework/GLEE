"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $9,000. It's a unique item that I believe you'll find valuable, and I think this price reflects its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room to negotiate. Alice is starting at a price higher than her own valuation, indicating she might be willing to go lower."
