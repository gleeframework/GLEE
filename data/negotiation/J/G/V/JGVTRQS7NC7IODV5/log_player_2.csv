"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, as you know the value of this product is significantly higher.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $11000 to make this work. Let's meet halfway on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Situation:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000, but it's getting closer.
* **Value and Risk:**  Accepting this offer means Bob saves $4,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but the risk of missing out on the product and having to pay John's higher price is greater.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly important to secure the product before time runs out."
