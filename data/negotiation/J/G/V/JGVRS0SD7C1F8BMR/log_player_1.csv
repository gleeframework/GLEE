Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding her minimum acceptable price. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so a price of $1,400,000 gives him a potential $100,000 gain, making it a tempting offer.
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a high price from Bob while acknowledging the risk that he might reject the offer."
