Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price to $140, which is still higher than my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, and the risk of rejecting it and having him walk away is high. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit, though a smaller one than I initially hoped for."
