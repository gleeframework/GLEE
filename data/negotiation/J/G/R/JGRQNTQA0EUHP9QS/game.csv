"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm excited to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $180 is too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120. I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that's fair to both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $95, which is $107.50. Let's see if we can meet at this price point.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $107.50 is still a little too high.  Let's split the difference again. How about $101.25?  I'm confident we can find a fair price that works for both of us.",101.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $101.25 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. Let's meet at $110, which is the midpoint between $107.50 and $112.5. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,7,
