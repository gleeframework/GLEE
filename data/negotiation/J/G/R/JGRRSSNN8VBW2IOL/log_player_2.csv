"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal from Alice.  You have nothing to lose by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, demonstrating your seriousness about wanting the product while leaving room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will counter back with a higher price, but hopefully closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price from her initial offer, and $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. There's a risk that Alice might reject a further counteroffer, and you could end up paying more. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
