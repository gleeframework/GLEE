Round 2
Bob's offer:

I want to try to get a higher price from Bob. It's worth more to him than $1,075,000, and I still have several rounds left to negotiate."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

With only two rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing much.  I've tried to compromise and get Bob closer to my desired price, but he's stuck on his budget. It's getting risky to keep rejecting his offers.  While $1,000,000 isn't my ideal price, it's better than risking getting nothing if Bob continues to refuse my offers. I need to secure the sale, and John is a guaranteed buyer."
