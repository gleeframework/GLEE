"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming for a quick deal but leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $13,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and hopefully we can finally agree on a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe I can potentially squeeze out a little more during the negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is my ultimate goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $13,250 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to make this deal happen. Let's make it final."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $13,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a continued willingness to compromise and shows that I'm serious about closing the deal. I'm also using a persuasive tone to encourage Bob to accept, emphasizing a ""fair price"" and the opportunity to finalize the agreement."
