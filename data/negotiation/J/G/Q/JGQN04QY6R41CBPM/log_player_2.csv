"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $90.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 feels a bit high.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to gauge her flexibility and potentially secure a great deal. 
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive and polite tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still remaining significantly below our maximum budget and John's alternative offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  How about we split the difference? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, there's still a gap between her offer and both our ideal price and John's alternative. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a better price while keeping the negotiation active. 
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** We haven't reached a point where John's $100 offer is our best option. Continuing with Alice might yield a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price. Offering $75 splits the difference between our previous offer ($65) and her current one ($85).
* **Staying Below John's Offer:** Our counteroffer remains below John's $100 price, ensuring we're still pursuing a better deal with Alice.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** We want to maintain a collaborative atmosphere to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
