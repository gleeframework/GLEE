"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  It's a fair price considering I'm valuing it at $15,000, and it's still a decent profit for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  It's a fair price considering your value and my value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
