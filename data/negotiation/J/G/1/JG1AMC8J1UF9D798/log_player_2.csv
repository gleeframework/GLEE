"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. He can still likely get a lower price by counteroffering. While $11,500 is a decent deal, it's still above his ideal price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd ideally like a lower price, $11,250 is a good deal compared to the $15,000 he'd pay John. Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it's unlikely to be significantly lower, and it risks Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
