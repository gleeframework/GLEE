Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is higher than what the product is worth to him, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $100. While it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This price is still higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's closer to his offer of $100, making it more attractive. This gives Bob some incentive to accept, while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and it's clear Bob isn't willing to meet my price expectations. To ensure I get my desired profit, I'll sell the product to John for $120."
