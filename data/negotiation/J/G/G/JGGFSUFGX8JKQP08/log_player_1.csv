Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it's still a ""deal"" compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, the message's tone is open to discussion, potentially leading to Bob accepting the price or countering with a still-profitable number. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,000. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward given the information available."
