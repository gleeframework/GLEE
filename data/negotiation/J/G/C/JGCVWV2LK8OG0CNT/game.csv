"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider a price of $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
