Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider a price of $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to go beyond his final offer of $1,000,000. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell it to him and avoid further negotiation."
