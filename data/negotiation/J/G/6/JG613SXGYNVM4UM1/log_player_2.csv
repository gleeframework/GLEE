"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and I'm aiming to save as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to keep negotiating and try to get closer to my $1,000,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a fair price, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 above my target price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get it for even less, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Alice might not budge further, and I could end up paying John's $1,500,000 price. Accepting this offer allows me to save a significant amount compared to John's price and also keeps the negotiation going smoothly."
