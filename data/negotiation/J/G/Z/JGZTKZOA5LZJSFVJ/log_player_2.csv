"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value and your interest, I propose we keep it confidential between us. For a limited time, you can acquire this exceptional item for $110. Don't miss out on this opportunity to secure a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, but you can get it for $120 from John if you reject Alice's offer.
* The goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Since you're willing to pay up to $120, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $120 saves you $10."
