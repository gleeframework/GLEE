"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While I value your interest, I need to stand firm at a price that reflects the true value of the product.  I'm willing to accept $825,000, which is a very competitive offer. This is my final offer, Bob.",825000.0,Alice,5,
