Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that it's a good deal. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and continue the negotiation. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject based on whether I think I can get a better price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for better deal:** I can still try to get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but counter-offering with a price that's closer to my minimum but still gives him some room to bargain. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that a price of $95 is a good deal for both of us. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm establishing my firm lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, and I don't believe I can get a higher price from him.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's not ideal, but it's a safe and reliable option.

Since I'm prioritizing getting at least my minimum price, and Bob's offer is below that, I'm choosing to sell to John for $100."
