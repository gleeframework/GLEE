Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Offering the product at $19,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially closer to your desired price. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value, which might make Bob more amenable to a higher price, even if it's above his perceived value. 
* **Alternative:**  By mentioning you will list it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, you might adjust your offer."
