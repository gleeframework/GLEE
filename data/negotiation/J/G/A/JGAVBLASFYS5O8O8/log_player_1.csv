{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value to Bob by mentioning it's a great deal for him.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning the price as fair for me, avoiding a negotiation that might drag on too long.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the dialogue.

This offer strikes a balance between aiming for a high price and initiating a negotiation that's likely to be productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $12,000 is Bob's maximum, it's significantly less than my minimum of $15,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I can counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.  I don't want to give up on a deal just yet.
* **Value of John's offer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the possibility of a better outcome while still having a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $12,000.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this deal work. It's still a fantastic price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not too drastically.
* **Value proposition:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob and positioning the price as still beneficial for him.
* **Openness to negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further discussion and compromise.
* **Alternative:** I'm not revealing my ""Plan B"" with John to maintain leverage. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap with Bob while staying within my acceptable range, encouraging him to potentially agree or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe $12,000 would be a fair price for both of us. I hope you can consider this as a final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm on his $12,000 offer, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome for me.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  John's offer of $15,000 is significantly better than Bob's offer, and it guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob could potentially lead to a stalemate or a lower price, wasting valuable time and effort.

Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable transaction, maximizing my earnings and minimizing potential risks."
