Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It also gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to give in just yet. I want to see if I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept, and I'm not confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
