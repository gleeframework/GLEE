It seems like Alice is not budging much on her price.  At this point, the offers from Alice are getting too close to John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with no guarantee of a better price from Alice.  Buying from John for $12,000 ensures you get the product without potentially wasting more time and rounds."
