"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Projecting Confidence:**  By starting high, I present the product as highly valuable, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Leaving an Out:** While this offer is high, I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. I also have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $14,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While there's room for negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer in subsequent rounds.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at my desired price, so it's strategically advantageous to sell to him now."
