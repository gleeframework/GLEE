"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's potential to save even more.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A lower price gives me more room to potentially compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000. This is a good deal, as I'm saving $400,000 compared to buying from John. While there's always a chance of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential for slightly more savings."
