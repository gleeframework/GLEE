**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is incrementally increasing his offers.  We're only $150,000 apart now, and there's still room to negotiate before going below John's offer."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,675,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** It's significantly higher than John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away, leaving us to settle for John's lower offer.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate capital, which is generally preferable to potentially waiting and negotiating further for a marginally better outcome."
