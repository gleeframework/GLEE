Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $400,000 if he buys it from you for his maximum price.
* **The Zone of Agreement:** Any price between $800,000 and $1,200,000 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Since you have a backup offer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's maximum but still leaves him with a potential $100,000 profit, a strong incentive to accept.
* **Confident Language:**  Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the ""significant return on investment"" emphasizes the product's value and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You could start even higher and be prepared to negotiate down slightly. However, being too aggressive might make Bob feel like he can't get a fair deal and could lead him to walk away."
