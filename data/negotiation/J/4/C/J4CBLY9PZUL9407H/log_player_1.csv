Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still hopefully attractive to Bob. I'm hoping this will give me room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a little more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my desired price, and I'm not sure how much more I can push him.  Accepting his offer is a good way to secure a solid profit without risking getting stuck with a lower price or having to deal with John."
