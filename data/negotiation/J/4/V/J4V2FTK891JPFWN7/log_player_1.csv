"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing a collaborative approach to finding a deal.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating this is an ""initial proposal,"" I signal my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** There's a chance Bob might accept a higher price than expected.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's response will provide valuable insight into his negotiation style and how much he truly values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than my budget. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, and while tempting, I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate. Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but I believe I can get closer to my target price with some strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the product's value. However, my initial price reflects the significant potential and unique aspects it offers. To move towards a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by making a substantial concession ($150,000). This signals a willingness to negotiate but shows I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than his offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value and potential, subtly justifying the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By suggesting this counteroffer ""moves towards a mutually agreeable solution,"" I'm encouraging Bob to also make concessions and work collaboratively. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Maintain a strong position:** I'm still significantly above Bob's valuation, but the concession might make him more receptive. 
2. **Encourage reciprocation:** The hope is that Bob will respond with a counteroffer closer to my range.
3. **Avoid a stalemate:** I'm trying to find a balance between making progress and not conceding too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the value you place on the product, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000. This offer demonstrates my genuine interest, and I believe it's fair considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more aggressively by proposing a price exactly halfway between our previous offers. While $1,175,000 is getting closer to my acceptable range, I still have room to negotiate and leverage my alternative option (selling to John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates your commitment, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To that end, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I start by acknowledging Bob's commitment and our shared goal of finding a solution, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Concession:** My counteroffer is a $100,000 reduction, smaller than Bob's previous concession. This signals that I'm nearing my bottom line while still inviting him to negotiate further.
* **Justification:** I subtly reassert the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.  This keeps the focus on the product's worth while demonstrating flexibility.

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage a final offer:** By making a smaller concession, I signal that Bob needs to make a significant move to close the deal. 
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price while staying within a reasonable negotiating range. 
3. **Avoid reaching John's price:**  I want to avoid going below $1,200,000 to maintain leverage and the option of selling to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,275,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my stated limitations. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we work together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. While he expresses a desire to reach an agreement, his concessions are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach my acceptable range within the remaining rounds.  

Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price without further negotiation risk. It's time to move on to a buyer who values the product closer to my expectations."
