"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to you.  I'm confident this price represents a fair market value. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, there's no room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer means you can still buy the product from John for the same price, effectively achieving your goal of getting the product while saving no money."
