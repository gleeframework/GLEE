Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic starting point:**  $900,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's value, I maintain leverage. If he rejects, I can always go to John and get my minimum desired price. 
* **Encouraging negotiation:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, $750,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John guarantees my desired price:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,000,000. This offers a risk-free alternative to negotiating further with Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. Bob will be motivated to come closer to my desired price to avoid losing the deal. 

I'll counter-offer Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price. If he doesn't budge, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a little lower than what I can accept at this time.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** By dropping to $850,000, I show willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, keeping the pressure on him. If he rejects, I can still go to John.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** My message clarifies that I'm willing to compromise but have a limit. This helps avoid a protracted negotiation.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob of the value of the product to him might sway him to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, it's still not a truly favorable deal for me. 
* **Guaranteed return with John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process, potentially leading to more concessions or a dead end. 

I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and I'd rather secure my minimum profit than risk further haggling with Bob."
