"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $13,000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
