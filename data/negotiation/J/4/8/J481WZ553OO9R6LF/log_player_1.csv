Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you something that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This strategy gives Bob a perceived discount while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
