"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the value I've placed on this product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking to my offer of $15,000.  This is a fair price for both of us - I get a great deal on a product I value, and you get to sell it. Let's make this happen.",15000.0,Bob,4,
