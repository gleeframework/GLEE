Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I believe this is a mutually beneficial opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, the goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it slightly below John's price creates a sense of a deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $950,000 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leaving Alice with the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
