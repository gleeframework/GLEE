"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to try and get Bob interested. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum of $15,000. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer or counter-offering. 
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** I'm aware of my other option with John, and will keep that in mind throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's room for further negotiation, and I can potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **More rounds available:**  We're only in round 2, and I have 8 more rounds to try and reach a more favorable price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we split the difference at $10,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not settling:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm using language like ""split the difference"" to make my offer appear reasonable and fair.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying ""you'll find the product worth every penny."" This could help sway him towards a higher price. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but gives Bob some space to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More rounds to negotiate:**  We're only in round 4. I still have 6 rounds left to try and reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Risk of selling to John:** If I accept Bob's offer, I'm losing out on a significant amount of money compared to selling to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  I will continue to push for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but will keep the option of selling to John in mind as the negotiation progresses."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,125? This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer again, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Splitting the difference:**  This tactic helps make my offer appear fair and reasonable to Bob.
* **Focusing on a win-win:** I'm emphasizing that this price would allow ""both of us to walk away happy."" This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Keeping the option open:**  I'm still keeping the option to sell to John in mind, but am confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $9,900. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Even though Bob is getting closer, $9,900 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Several rounds left:** We are only in round 6, and I have 4 more rounds to try to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offers are getting closer, there is still potential to reach a higher price. I don't want to settle for a deal that leaves me significantly under my desired value.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the opportunity to continue negotiating and try to secure a price closer to my desired range.  However, I will start to consider the possibility of selling to John as the rounds decrease, as I do not want to risk losing out on a significantly better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, $9,900 is still quite far from what I need to make this deal work. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would be a reasonable compromise that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer again, but I'm firm on the fact that $10,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. 
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a ""mutually beneficial agreement,""  appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Urgency to close:** I'm using the phrase ""Let's close this deal now"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer. 
* **Awareness of John:**  I'm aware of John's offer and am starting to feel the pressure of time. This offer is the final compromise I'm willing to make before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can only go up to $9,950. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, leaving only 2 rounds left. 
* **Price is too low:** $9,950 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Significant potential loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss of $5,050 compared to selling to John.

Given the limited time and the significant potential loss, it's strategically better to sell to John at this point.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of losing out on a much better deal with John is too high."
