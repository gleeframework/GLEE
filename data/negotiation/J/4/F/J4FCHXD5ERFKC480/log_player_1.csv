"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This sets a strong initial point and allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm offering $1,900,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still well above Bob's current offer.  I'm hoping to meet halfway and get closer to my desired price while showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,750,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I'm starting to feel the pressure as rounds pass, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm offering $1,850,000. This is a compromise from my previous counteroffer, but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. This is a critical round as we're halfway through the negotiation. I'll be watching closely to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price. The pressure is mounting, but I'm still not ready to settle.  I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round.  I'm starting to consider the option of selling to John, though, as we're running out of time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This is my final attempt to push for a higher price. I'm dropping my offer to $1,800,000, which is still a significant amount. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product and Bob's previous offers.  If he rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high. While I can still counteroffer and attempt to get a slightly better price, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept, and I could end up with a lower price than John's offer. 

Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
