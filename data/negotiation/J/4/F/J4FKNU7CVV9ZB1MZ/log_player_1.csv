{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's still a good profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit margin for me, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale entirely."
