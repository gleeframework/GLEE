Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $95 is also below Bob's maximum value of $100, leaving space for a compromise. 
* **It's a clear offer:** The message is straightforward and the price is stated clearly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $95 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is more than your minimum of $80, it's significantly lower than your initial offer of $95. It's worth trying to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John.  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's more favorable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we settle for $78? It's closer to your asking price while still fitting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $78 is still below the price you initially wanted, it's very close to your minimum of $80 and significantly higher than Bob's last offer of $70. Accepting this offer means you get a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially result in a lower price or even a sale to John for $80."
