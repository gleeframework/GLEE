"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm starting with a price of $115, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $102.50? That gives us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
