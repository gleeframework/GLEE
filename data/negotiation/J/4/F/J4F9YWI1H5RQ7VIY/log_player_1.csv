{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your operations.  My asking price is $1,450,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

This offer is a starting point that balances a good profit margin for me while leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a ""Plan B"" in John, so I can be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to work with me, but $1450000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1350000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  While selling to John is always an option, I'd prefer to maximize my profit by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value the product brings to you while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1375000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that's within my range and closer to your asking price. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it's within a reasonable negotiation range. It's worth accepting to avoid further rounds and potential risks."
