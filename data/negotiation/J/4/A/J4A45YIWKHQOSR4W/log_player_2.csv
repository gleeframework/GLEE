Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $17000 for it.  Let's find a way to make this work.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is simply too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to drop the price to $15500.  This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and gives you a great value on the product.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above your budget.  While it's closer to your target price, it's worth continuing to negotiate in case you can get a better deal.  It's also worth considering that you can always buy from John for $10,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."
