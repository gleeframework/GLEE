"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $1050000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product and takes into account your concerns about the initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $950000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to get this done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which is $975000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account your concerns about the initial offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $960000, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $960000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $960000, which is $967500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account your concerns about the initial offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we may not be able to reach an agreement, so I'm willing to compromise further.",967500.0,Alice,7,
