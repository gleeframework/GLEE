```"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $950,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to get this done."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000, which is $975000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account your concerns about the initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $960,000, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $960000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $960000, which is $967500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account your concerns about the initial offer. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we may not be able to reach an agreement, so I'm willing to compromise further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $967,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $967,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating, you're now within a very small range of your target price.  Given the time constraints (only 3 rounds left) and the risk of Alice further increasing her price, it's more advantageous to purchase from John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees you the product within your budget and avoids the potential for further price hikes."
