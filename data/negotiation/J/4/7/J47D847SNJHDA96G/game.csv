"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,200?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,600 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",7800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting close! I can tell we're both motivated to make a deal. How about $7,700 and we shake on it?",7700.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,850? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",7850.0,Alice,7,
