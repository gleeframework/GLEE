"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and Alice's initial offer is $10,000, there's no benefit to negotiating further. Buying from John immediately guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
