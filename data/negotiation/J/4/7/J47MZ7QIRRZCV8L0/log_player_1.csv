Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is too far below what I need for this product. Let's meet in the middle. How about $90?  I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
