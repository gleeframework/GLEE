Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and it seems like we're reaching a stalemate. I'd rather sell to Bob than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower price."
