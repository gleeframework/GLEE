"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway if you're willing to come down from $10000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $6000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8500? This still gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway again and offer $7250. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7250.0,Bob,4,
