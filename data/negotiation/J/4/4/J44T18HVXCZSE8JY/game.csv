"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $12,000 right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go to $15,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm happy to walk away if it doesn't work for you.",15000.0,Bob,4,
