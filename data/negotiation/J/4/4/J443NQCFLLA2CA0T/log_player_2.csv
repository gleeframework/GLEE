"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I'm open to negotiating, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still quite high. You can definitely do better.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me and my budget, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate from. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $850000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still too high.  While it's a compromise, you're still paying more than you'd like.  You should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product, which is closer to the value I see in it.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $885000. This is the lowest I can go and still ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $885,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and closer to your counteroffer. This is a good deal for you, considering your budget and the fact that John is selling the same product for $1,000,000.  While you might be able to push for a slightly lower price, accepting this offer will save you $115,000 compared to buying from John."
