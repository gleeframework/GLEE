I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a more reasonable price and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,150,000. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
