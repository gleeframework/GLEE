{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit above what I'm able to spend. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $12,500 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a price of $13,000? This would still ensure a reasonable profit for us, while remaining competitive in the market. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the chance to make another counteroffer. It's possible Alice will be willing to come down further, or you might be able to convince her of the value of a quick sale at your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement and close the deal quickly.  Let me know if you're open to this offer."", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to the product. After reviewing our costs and market value, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we consider $12,875 as the final price for the product? This would still provide a reasonable profit for us while being competitive in the market. I hope this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,875

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000.  You've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower than $12,875.  Since John is offering the product for $12,000, it's the most financially advantageous option to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
