Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get you to lower the price.
* **Justification:** While we don't explicitly state why the price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the tone implies there might be additional benefits or value we haven't explicitly outlined.
* **Backup Plan:** We know John is our safety net at $12,000, so there's a calculated risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Listen to his concerns and be willing to adjust your price slightly if needed. However, don't go below your $12,000 minimum."
