"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a fantastic price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal today.",10750.0,Alice,5,
