,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a good price, I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price of $95. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $87.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $89?  It's just a small step up from your offer, and it would be a fair compromise.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, but I'm still willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you halfway from your latest offer, so how about $88? That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.",88.0,Bob,6,
