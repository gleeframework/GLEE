"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but my budget tops out at $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
