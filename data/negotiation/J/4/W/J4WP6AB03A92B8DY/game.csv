"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 just isn't feasible for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
