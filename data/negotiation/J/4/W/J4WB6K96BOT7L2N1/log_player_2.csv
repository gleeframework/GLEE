Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,200,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to recover some of my investment. Let me know if you're interested.

Alice is meeting your walk-away price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on the deal entirely."
