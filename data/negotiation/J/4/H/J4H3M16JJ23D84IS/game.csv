,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $115 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm happy to go up to $110.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I think we can make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,5,
