"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $160. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth from John.  You should definitely make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget of around $80. Would you be willing to go that low?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a much lower offer ($80), you anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""I have a budget of around $80"") makes your counteroffer seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial counteroffer leaves space for negotiation. You can always increase your offer slightly if Alice completely rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I understand your budget, $80 is too low for me.  Could you do $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice came down a little, but $140 is still significantly above your $100 limit and her product's worth ($120).
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **John's Offer:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $100 is your safety net. You don't want to get caught up in negotiations with Alice and end up paying more than John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we meet halfway at $110?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering $110 is a significant move from your $80 offer, signaling flexibility on your part.  
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Suggesting to ""meet halfway"" frames the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a fair price.
* **Still Below Limit:** Importantly, $110 keeps you below your $120 maximum while being above Alice's potential ""walk-away"" point (remember, she values the product at $120)."
