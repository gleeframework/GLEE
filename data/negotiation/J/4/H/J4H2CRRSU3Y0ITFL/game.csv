"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product but $900,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
