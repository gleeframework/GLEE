"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$135 offer:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and start the negotiation process.  By offering a price slightly higher than his perceived value, there's a good chance Bob will counteroffer, giving Alice the opportunity to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is a decent offer, it's still below Alice's minimum value of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to her target price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice demonstrates her willingness to hold out for a better price.  This sets the stage for a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $130:** This represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and Alice's previous offer.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message remains friendly and reiterates Alice's willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to continue the conversation. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise, Alice shows flexibility while still maintaining a price above her minimum value. This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully secure a deal closer to her desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. How about we try $127.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $127.5 is closer to Alice's minimum value, it's still below her desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows Alice to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

Alice's strategy is to push for a higher price while maintaining her minimum value.  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates her firm stance and sets the stage for another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but $127.50 is still below what I need.  Let's split the difference and go with $128.75.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 128.75} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $128.75:** This represents a further compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and Alice's previous offer. 
* **Focus on compromise and fairness:** The message emphasizes that this offer is a fair compromise, highlighting the benefits of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise and emphasizing fairness, Alice aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing Alice's profit and ensuring a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $128.75. I was thinking more along the lines of $122.50. That's the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below Alice's minimum value:**  $122.5 is significantly less than Alice's minimum price of $150.
* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks ending up with a price lower than Alice's minimum.

**Strategy:**

Alice's goal is to maximize her profit.  With Bob's repeated offers staying below her minimum value, selling to John at $150 becomes the most advantageous option.  This guarantees Alice her minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
