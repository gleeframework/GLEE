"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $130. How about we try $127.50? That's the best I can do.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down just a bit more, but $127.50 is still below what I need.  Let's split the difference and go with $128.75.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",128.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go up to $128.75. I was thinking more along the lines of $122.50. That's the best I can do. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal.",122.5,Bob,6,
