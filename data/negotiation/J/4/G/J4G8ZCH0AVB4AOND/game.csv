"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to save a bit of money. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $110?  That would still be a great price for you, and it would give me a bit more to work with.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",105.0,Bob,4,
