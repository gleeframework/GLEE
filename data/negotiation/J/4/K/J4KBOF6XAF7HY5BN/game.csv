"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to stay closer to my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
