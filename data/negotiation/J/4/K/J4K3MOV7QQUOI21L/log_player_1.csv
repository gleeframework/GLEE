Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,999, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible without going below her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Creating Urgency:**  By slightly lowering the price from the guaranteed sale to John, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than selling to John."
