"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is far above your budget. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if you can get a better price. Buying from John immediately would be your only option if you were willing to pay the full $800,000, but there's a chance you can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with my maximum budget is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to show Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and am not willing to pay anything close to her initial offer.  I'm hoping to get a counteroffer from her, but if she rejects it, I'll have a better understanding of her minimum price and can adjust my strategy for the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice in the hopes of getting a price closer to my maximum limit.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but she's still holding out for a significant amount more than I'm willing to pay.  This counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than my initial offer but still lower than her last offer.  I'm hoping this will signal my willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a lower price. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be more aggressive with my counteroffers to ensure I can secure a deal before I have to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly holding out for a higher price, but with only 4 rounds left, I need to push for a deal.  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. This is my final push to get Alice to come down in price before I have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm taking a risk by rejecting her offer, but I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to my maximum limit. I need to stay persistent and try to push for a lower price before I'm forced to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're down to the wire. Alice is clearly not going to accept a price lower than $1 million.  This counteroffer is my last attempt to meet her halfway before I have to buy from John. I'm hoping she sees the value in finalizing the deal with me, but if she rejects this offer, I'll be forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  There is only one round left, and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1 million. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option at this point. It saves me $25,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer and guarantees I get the product. While I would have liked to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of not securing the product at all is too high."
