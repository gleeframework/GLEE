"Alice, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 right now. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still more than I can afford.  My final offer is $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  If you reject this offer, I'll have to move on to other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
