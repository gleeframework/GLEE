"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above my budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above my maximum budget.  This will hopefully encourage Alice to come down in price, but if she rejects, I still have more rounds to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  While it is closer to my target price, I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your product is valuable, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget but offering a slight increase to show I'm serious about buying the product. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. If she rejects, I'll still have more rounds to try and find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $15,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's tempting to accept, but I'm not willing to go that high. I have 5 rounds left, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Alice to go lower.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still more than I can afford.  My final offer is $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  If you reject this offer, I'll have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget and offering a final price of $13,000. This is a compromise, but still a good deal for me.  If Alice rejects, I'll have no choice but to move on."
