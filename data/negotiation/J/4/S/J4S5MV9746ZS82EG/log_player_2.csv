"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the price.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, while still being above her minimum value. It shows you are serious about buying but are looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal.  Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation, potentially bringing the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident that this product will be worth it for both of us at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again splits the difference between your last offer and Alice's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. It also provides a clear reason for the offer, emphasizing value for both parties."
