"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm confident that this product will be worth it for both of us at this price.",90.0,Bob,4,
