,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product's value, but I am only willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,150,000. This reflects a significant discount, but it's also the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I still feel that $1,150,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose $1,125,000 as a potential price for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,137,500. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both be satisfied with. What do you say?",1137500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with $1,130,000 for your product. I believe this is a reasonable price that respects both our positions in the negotiation. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1130000.0,Bob,6,
