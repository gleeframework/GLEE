"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" aims to influence Bob's perception of its worth.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** Using phrases like ""starting price"" and ""proposing"" signals my willingness to engage in a negotiation and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived maximum value for the product. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I still have room to maneuver and potentially secure a better price. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving significantly closer to Bob's offer to signal flexibility but staying firmly above my minimum price.  
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, I aim to gently push back against Bob's lower valuation.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The $1,300,000 price point splits the difference between our previous positions, encouraging a sense of fairness and progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards a more acceptable price. However, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a potential alternative if the gap doesn't close soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the very limit of what I can accept for the product, taking into account its value and my own costs.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but setting a firm boundary at $1,250,000. This price is still a gain above my guaranteed sale to John.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing it's my ""final offer"" and mentioning ""costs,"" I'm signaling that I'm reaching my limit, urging Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By highlighting the deal's fairness for both parties, I'm encouraging Bob to accept and avoid potentially missing out."
