"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is well above his maximum budget.  He can get the product from John for less, but it's worth exploring if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation with Alice, so he should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the very limit of what I can accept for the product, taking into account its value and my own costs.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above his budget. While there's a chance he could negotiate further, he's already had several rounds and it seems unlikely Alice will go lower. John is offering a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making it the best option in this situation."
