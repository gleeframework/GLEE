"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,000,000.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the very limit of what I can accept for the product, taking into account its value and my own costs.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
