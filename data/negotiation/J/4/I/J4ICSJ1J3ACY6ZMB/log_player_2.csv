"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

This is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saves money:**  Buying from Alice at $110 is cheaper than John's $120 price.
* **Within budget:** The price of $110 is under Bob's $120 limit."
