"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly below Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle.  It also gives us a sense of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to her valuation. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about $80?  That's a fair price and would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

We're getting closer. Offering Alice her valuation of the product might be a good move to close the deal quickly, but it also risks leaving money on the table. Let's see how she responds."
