You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a better chance of getting a deal closer to your target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a starting point that reflects my desire to save as much money as possible while acknowledging the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price point of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and continue to negotiate. I am willing to pay $8,000, but I believe there's still room to get closer to that price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying the product, but still keeping it under my maximum price point.  This counteroffer reflects a willingness to compromise while trying to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay $8,000, Alice's offer of $8,600 is only slightly above my maximum price point and represents a significant improvement from previous offers. It's likely that further negotiation will lead to a stalemate or a counteroffer that I might reject, leading to a longer negotiation process.  Therefore, it's more efficient to accept this offer and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
