"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me there?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $85?  It's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me there?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my minimum.  This price is still a great value for you, considering how much the product is worth to you.",80.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $80, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,6,
