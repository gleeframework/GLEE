Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $85?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher with Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $80, which is my minimum.  This price is still a great value for you, considering how much the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $80, which would be $77.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, but he's not willing to meet my minimum price.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation window, so I'm going to accept John's offer of $80 to ensure I get at least my minimum profit."
