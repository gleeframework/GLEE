Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high starting point.  This allows for more room to negotiate downward if necessary.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Potential:**  A high starting price gives me the best chance of getting the highest possible price.
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response will tell me a lot about his interest and how much he values the product. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer accordingly. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $800,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
