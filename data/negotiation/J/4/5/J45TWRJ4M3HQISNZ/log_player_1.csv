Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's above your value for the product and still within my price range. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
