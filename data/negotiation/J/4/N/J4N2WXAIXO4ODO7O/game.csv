,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we try $13500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $13000. I'm a serious buyer, and I'm willing to make a decision today. Can we make it work at this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13200? It's a small increase from your last offer, but I think it's worth it for a serious buyer like you.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $13200. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I need to be honest with you, I've already spoken with another seller who is willing to sell it to me for $10000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you think about meeting me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,8,
