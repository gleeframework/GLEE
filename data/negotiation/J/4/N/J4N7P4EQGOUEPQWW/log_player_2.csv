"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for both parties. It will be interesting to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see if I can do a bit better. How about $110? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of our previous offers.  It seems like a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
