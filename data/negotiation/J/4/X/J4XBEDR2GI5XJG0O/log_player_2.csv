"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $19,000 is far too high for his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice first, but if she doesn't come down in price, Bob has a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $16,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should reject this offer and continue negotiating. Since John is willing to sell for $12,000,  Bob has a solid baseline to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
