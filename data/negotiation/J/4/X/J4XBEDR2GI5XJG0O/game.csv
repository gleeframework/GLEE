"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $16,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,000?  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
