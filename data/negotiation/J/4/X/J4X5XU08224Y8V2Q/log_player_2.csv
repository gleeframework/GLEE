"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is likely starting high. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize her to come down in price."
