"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure,  I believe it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential this product holds for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $2,050,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
