"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
