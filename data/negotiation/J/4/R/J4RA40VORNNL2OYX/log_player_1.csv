Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $950,000. I believe it holds significant value for your company, and this price reflects that while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm going to stick with my strategy and reject the offer. Bob clearly values the product, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. However, I can't go lower than $890,000. This price still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and allows me to stay within my minimum expectations.  I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $890,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $880,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to my company. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to my minimum price, and there's a risk that if I keep rejecting, he may walk away, leaving me with only the $800,000 offer from John.  It's important to consider the potential for lost opportunities and ensure a secure sale."
