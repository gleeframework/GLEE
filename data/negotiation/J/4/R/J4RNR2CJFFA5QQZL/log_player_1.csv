Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it and believe I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to push for a lower price, but $1,275,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,312,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1312500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. Can we compromise on this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good deal and secures a sale within my desired range.  It's also less risky than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,200,000."
