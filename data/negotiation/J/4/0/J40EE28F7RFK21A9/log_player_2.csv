"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value is worth $800,000 to you. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 is the best strategy."
