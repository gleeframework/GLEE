"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'll need to factor in the number of rounds remaining and adjust my price accordingly."

I'm counteroffering at $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum value, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal.  We're getting close to the middle ground, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
