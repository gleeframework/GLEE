"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can do $110 for the product, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Okay, $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $95? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can agree on a price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can meet you halfway at $105, but that's the lowest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $95. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look at other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
