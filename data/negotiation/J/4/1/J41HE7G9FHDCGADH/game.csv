"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $12000 to me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9200 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly higher than your offer. How about $10300?
