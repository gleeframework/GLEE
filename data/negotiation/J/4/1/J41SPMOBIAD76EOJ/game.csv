"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've already expressed interest in the product. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've expressed in this product. Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000.
