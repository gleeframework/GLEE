"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who will gladly purchase it for $1000000. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
