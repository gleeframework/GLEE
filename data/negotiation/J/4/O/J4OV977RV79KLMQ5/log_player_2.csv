"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who will gladly purchase it for $1000000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
