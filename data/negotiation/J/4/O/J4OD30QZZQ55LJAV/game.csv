"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your desire to sell. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a reasonable price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can finally reach a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
