Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,199,999. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **High but Negotiable:** The offer of $1,199,999 is just below your guaranteed price, leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal if he negotiates down a tiny bit.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as a ""unique opportunity,"" subtly implying that Bob shouldn't miss out. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still making it appealing enough for him to accept."
