"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could come down to $15,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product but $15,000 is still more than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
