Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer, and I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,550,000 for this product to make it worthwhile for me. This is a very competitive offer given the value you're getting. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go lower than $1,550,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse outcome. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
