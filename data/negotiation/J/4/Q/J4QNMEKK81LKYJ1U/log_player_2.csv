"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, you establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for you to gradually increase your offer while still aiming for a final price well below $12,000.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will give you a better sense of the potential for reaching a mutually agreeable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, $14,000 is still above your $12,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have several rounds left, and Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests you can get the price lower. 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, you always have the option to buy from John at $12,000 if negotiations stall."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $14,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, but I'd need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  How about it?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:**  You're aiming for a gradual increase to keep the negotiation moving, but you're still well below your $12,000 maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests how much further Alice is willing to go. If she's adamant about a price above $12,000, you'll need to decide whether to push harder or go with John. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering $11,000, you leave some room for a possible compromise in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Even though Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still above your $12,000 limit and only a slight concession from her previous offer.
* **John is Looking Good:** At this point, the difference between Alice's likely final price and John's offer is getting smaller. You're not saving much by continuing with Alice.
* **Final Push:** You could use your next counteroffer to signal that you're very close to accepting John's offer. This might push Alice to make a more significant move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Honestly, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I do have another option lined up at $12,000, so I'd need to see a price closer to that to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're being direct about your budget constraints and the alternative offer while acknowledging Alice's efforts.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're serious about walking away if Alice doesn't meet your needs. 
* **Strategic Compromise:** You're moving closer to your limit but leaving some room for Alice to potentially counter with a price that's acceptable to you (e.g., $12,000 or slightly above)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time to Cut Bait:** Alice is clearly hesitant to go below $13,000.  You've negotiated well, but it's unlikely she'll move much further.
* **John's Price is Better:** You've reached a point where the potential savings with Alice are minimal compared to John's guaranteed offer. 
* **No More Leverage:**  You've used your leverage (the alternative offer) effectively, but Alice isn't budging enough to make it worth continuing. Accepting John's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price."
