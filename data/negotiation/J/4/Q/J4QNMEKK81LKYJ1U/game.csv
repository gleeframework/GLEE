"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $14,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, but I'd need to be closer to $11,000 to make this work.  How about it?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500 for the product. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Honestly, $13,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I do have another option lined up at $12,000, so I'd need to see a price closer to that to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Bob,6,
