"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, but also shows Bob that I value the product highly.  I'll see what his reaction is and adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I'll counter with a lower price, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a decent compromise. It's  significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000 and I'm getting closer to my initial target.  It's time to close the deal."
