"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good return.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me, especially considering the product's worth to him. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good price for Bob, given the product's worth to him, and it's closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  While I'm confident I could continue to negotiate,  I'm not sure I can get close to my desired price in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a good return, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing."
