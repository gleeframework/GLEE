"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  $975,000 is a good offer, but I still need to make a profit on this deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell at $1,012,500. This price is fair to both of us, and it will allow us to finalize this transaction.  What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
