"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,800 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,650?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",10650.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,650. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,000? I've already found a backup offer from John for this price, so I really need to make a decision soon.",10000.0,Bob,6,
