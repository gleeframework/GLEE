"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to negotiate. This encourages Bob to engage constructively. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** I am conscious that I have the alternative of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price. This knowledge allows me to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a good return on your investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer does show some movement, it's crucial I stand firm to maximize my potential profit. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below a price that reflects the product's true value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,325,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities while offering you a competitive deal."", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting him halfway between our previous positions. 
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's value and subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point.
* **Urgency:** By proposing a specific number, I'm aiming to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This price is closer to what I can afford and still provides you with a substantial return on your investment. Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating incrementally, and while his offer is getting closer to a point I might consider, it's still too low. I need to push him further and signal that significant jumps are needed to reach a deal. I'm willing to risk another rejection to achieve a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  If this doesn't work, I may need to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** I'm communicating a sense of urgency and finality by stating this is my final offer.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time to signal that my price floor is approaching.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of my alternative option (John), adding weight to my position without issuing a direct ultimatum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By setting a firm stance, I aim to incentivize Bob to make a more substantial move if he's truly interested in closing the deal."
