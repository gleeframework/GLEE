"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a good return on your investment.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is still significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1,325,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities while offering you a competitive deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This price is closer to what I can afford and still provides you with a substantial return on your investment. Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  If this doesn't work, I may need to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
