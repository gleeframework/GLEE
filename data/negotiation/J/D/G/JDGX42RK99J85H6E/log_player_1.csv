Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $8,000.**  
* **There are still rounds left.**  I want to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This gives you a significant discount, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer of $9,000 is above my minimum price of $8,000.**  This is a good deal for me.
* **We're getting close to a deal.** While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
