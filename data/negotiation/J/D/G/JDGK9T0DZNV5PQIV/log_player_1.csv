Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate a price that's mutually beneficial.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** By starting high, you set the tone for the negotiation and give yourself leverage to move down in price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is still a good deal for both of us and lets us close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do a bit better. How about $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my counteroffer.  It's likely we won't get much closer and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $9,200."
