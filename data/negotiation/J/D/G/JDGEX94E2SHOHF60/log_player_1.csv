Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's exact willingness to pay above $8,000 is unknown. By offering it at $10,000, we can see how interested he truly is and adjust accordingly if needed.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob's valuation in mind."
