"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to go up to $12000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $15000. Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $13500?  I'm really eager to get this product, but that's the absolute highest I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your eagerness to get the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13500. I can offer it to you for $14000, which is a bit closer to my target price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
