Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price given my assessment of the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I've assessed, I can go as high as $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
