"I understand that $1550000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1700000.

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1550000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I could purchase it from another seller for the same amount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
