"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you given its potential. To make this a swift deal, I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's product might be valuable, her offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money."
