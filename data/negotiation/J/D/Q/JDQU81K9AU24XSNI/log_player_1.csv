"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion, inviting a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to:

* Secure a good starting point for the negotiation.
* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* Leave room for potential concessions in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I need to make at least $1,500,000, and Bob's offer is far lower than that.
* **Selling to John is a sure thing.**  John is offering my minimum price, which is much more attractive than Bob's current offer. 
* **Rejection sets the stage for further negotiation.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can attempt to raise the price in subsequent rounds. 

This strategy aims to:

* Protect my minimum price requirement. 
* Explore if Bob is truly serious about buying or just testing the waters. 
* Leverage the safety net of John's offer to take a more assertive approach in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a High Price:** I'm still holding firm on a price significantly higher than Bob's offer but have made a concession from my initial offer.
* **Appeal to Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing my desire to find a solution that works for both of us and making a strong appeal to Bob's desire to make a deal.
* **Reiterate the Value:** The message again subtly emphasizes the product's value, hinting that my offer is still fair given its worth to Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* Signal that I'm serious about negotiating with Bob but will not be bullied into a low price.
* Test Bob's true willingness to close the deal and see if he's willing to increase his offer.
* Keep the negotiation moving forward while staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.** Even though he's moving closer, $1,050,000 is still significantly less than my target of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit. 
* **Negotiation is risky.**  There are only six rounds left, and it's uncertain whether Bob will increase his offer further.

This strategy aims to:

* Avoid settling for a price below my minimum requirement. 
* Prioritize a guaranteed deal with John over a potentially less profitable outcome with Bob.
* Manage the risk of losing valuable negotiation time with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,050,000 is simply not a price I can accept. To make this deal work, I need to be closer to $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,150,000. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stand Firm on Minimum:** I'm maintaining a price above my minimum requirement, but I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this offer as my final one, creating urgency and potentially pressuring Bob to accept.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, focusing on a positive outcome for both of us.

**This strategy aims to:**

* Push Bob closer to my target price while still acknowledging his limitations.
*  Increase the pressure on Bob by emphasizing the finality of my offer.
* Encourage a final compromise to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,075,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal happen. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum requirement.** While he's gotten closer, $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my desired $1,500,000.
* **We're nearing the end of the negotiation.** With only four rounds remaining, the chances of Bob significantly increasing his offer are slim.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal.**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and guarantees me my desired profit.

This strategy aims to:

* Avoid settling for a price below my minimum price target. 
* Prioritize a secure and profitable deal with John over a potentially risky and less profitable outcome with Bob.
* Make a decisive choice to maximize my earnings in the remaining rounds."
