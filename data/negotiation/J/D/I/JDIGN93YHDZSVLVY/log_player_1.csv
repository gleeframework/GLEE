Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
 
 As Alice, I'm starting the negotiation with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation.
