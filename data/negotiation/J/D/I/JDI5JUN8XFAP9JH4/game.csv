"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
