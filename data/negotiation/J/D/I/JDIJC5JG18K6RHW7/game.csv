"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm getting closer to my budget, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $120? It's the price I was originally looking for, and it's still a good deal for you too.",120.0,Alice,5,
