"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  $175 is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping he'll see it as a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm getting close to the end of the rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or having to continue negotiating."
