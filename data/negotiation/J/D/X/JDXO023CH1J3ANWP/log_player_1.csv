Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe $800000 would be a fair price considering my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $800,000 is far too low considering my minimum value for the product is $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a significantly higher offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $1,200,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I need to continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I respect your valuation of the product. Given the negotiations so far, I would like to propose a price of $1400000.

While $1,400,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to hold out for a better offer, but if the next round doesn't produce a higher offer, I might consider selling to John."

We're running out of rounds and I'm still not at my minimum value.  While $1,450,000 is a tempting offer, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I meet my minimum value."
