"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This represents a fair price considering my needs and the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit outside your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and your needs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to consider your offer of $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'll make a counteroffer of $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your needs.
