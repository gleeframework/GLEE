"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show interest:** Maintaining a positive tone can lead to smoother negotiations.
* **Anchor a lower price:**  Starting significantly below our target price provides room for negotiation. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** We don't want to lowball Alice and risk her losing interest completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a price I like, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer again before accepting her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Splitting the difference:** We're meeting Alice exactly in the middle of the previous offer ($110) and our last counter-offer ($90). This can signal fairness and a willingness to close the deal.
* **Reaching our target:** $100 is the price we're aiming for, so we're making it clear this is a desirable outcome for us. 
* **Maintaining politeness:**  We continue the friendly and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $100, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we didn't reach our ideal price of $100, getting the product for $115 is a reasonable deal.  It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling might risk losing the opportunity altogether."
