Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit. 

I'm starting with a slightly lower price than I could potentially get from John to see if I can reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is too low for me. It's below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering $105, which is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to his offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum value."
