"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can we compromise on that price?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $937,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $937,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. Can we meet in the middle one more time?",920000.0,Bob,6,
