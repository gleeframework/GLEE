Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still significantly higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, allowing for some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **It signals your confidence:**  By starting high, you show that you believe the product is valuable, which could encourage Bob to take your offer seriously. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get.  You have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer. By rejecting, you can:

* **Continue negotiating:**  You can try to push Bob closer to your desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's true interest:**  See how determined he is to purchase the product and how much he's willing to budge.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You're in a strong position because you have an alternative buyer.

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you have the opportunity to secure a better price or at least gain a better understanding of Bob's negotiating style and his upper limit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's offer:** By offering $950,000, you're showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above your minimum. 
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the unique value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, aiming to keep the negotiation productive and avoid an impasse.

This counteroffer allows you to continue the negotiation while staying above your minimum price, giving you a good chance to reach an acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Can we compromise on that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $925,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get.  You have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, so there's still no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer. By rejecting, you can:

* **Continue negotiating:**  You can try to push Bob closer to your desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's true interest:**  See how determined he is to purchase the product and how much he's willing to budge.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You're in a strong position because you have an alternative buyer.

Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer could lead to a better price or, if Bob doesn't budge, you can move on to selling to John and securing your guaranteed higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $937,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 937500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $925,000.
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  The message highlights the compromise aspect and suggests a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, aiming to keep the negotiation productive and avoid an impasse.

This counteroffer maintains your negotiating leverage while showing a willingness to compromise, making it more likely that you can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $937,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. Can we meet in the middle one more time? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still below what you'd ideally like to get.  However, you have a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John, and it's becoming clear that Bob may not be willing to meet your price expectations.  There's a high likelihood that further negotiations will be lengthy and ultimately not result in a significant price increase.

Considering your guaranteed offer from John, it's more advantageous to:

* **Sell to John:** By accepting John's offer, you secure a higher price, avoid further negotiation, and ensure a quick and reliable transaction. 

While you might get slightly more with Bob, the potential gains are outweighed by the time and uncertainty involved in continued negotiations.  It's more prudent to take the guaranteed, higher price from John."
