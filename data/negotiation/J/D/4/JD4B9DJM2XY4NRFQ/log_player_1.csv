Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial ask to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
