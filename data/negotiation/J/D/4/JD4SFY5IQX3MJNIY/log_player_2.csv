"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has no information about the value of the product to Alice.  Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $12,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice is willing to sell it for less.  If negotiations fail, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $10,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise, bringing her price closer to Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  It's still within Bob's budget of $12,000, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000, so it's a good decision."
