"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
