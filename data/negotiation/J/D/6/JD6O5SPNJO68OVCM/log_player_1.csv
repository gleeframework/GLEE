``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to push for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the product's value. I'm also reminding Bob of the potential benefits of the product to further encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum, but closer to my initial offer. I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm running out of time, so I'll need to be more decisive in my counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $750,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you say $825,000 is your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to counter with mine.  I can do $780,000, and no higher.  It's a fair price, and I think it's important we close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. We're running out of rounds, and I'm getting closer to John's offer. However, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

It's the best I can do, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, knowing that it's only slightly higher than John's offer. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to push Bob into accepting. I'm trying to reach a compromise while still getting a price that's fair to me."
