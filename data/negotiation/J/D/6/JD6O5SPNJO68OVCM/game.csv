"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $750,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to explore other options. ",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say $825,000 is your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to counter with mine.  I can do $780,000, and no higher.  It's a fair price, and I think it's important we close this deal.  What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $780,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer. It's the best I can do, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere. ",800000.0,Alice,7,
