"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to consider $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from meeting my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
