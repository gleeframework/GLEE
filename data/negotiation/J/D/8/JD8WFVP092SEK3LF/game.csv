,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? ",105.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with $105. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?,95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
