Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $14,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not showing a willingness to meet at a reasonable price point. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump up to an acceptable offer. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss, and further negotiation might not yield significantly better results. It's best to cut losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
