Let's negotiate! Alice's starting price is too high considering her own valuation of the product.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a better price."

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $95 seems a bit high for me.  Would you consider $70?"",

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation of $80 while still leaving me room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $85 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

Alice is getting closer, but $85 is still a bit high. I'll try to meet her somewhere in the middle."
