"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and your budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This is a good compromise for both of us. It's closer to your asking price and still fits within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
