(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $8,000 is a good starting point, but there's likely room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's favorable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better than Alice's initial price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  I believe I can get the price down closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $6,500. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired range. While I might be able to negotiate further, I'm at a point where the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential gain of a slightly lower price."
