"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a competitive price.",8750.0,Alice,3,
