"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I can do $90 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $75? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand what you mean by meeting in the middle, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're at a bit of an impasse.  To be honest, anything above $80 and I might as well go with another seller.  So here's my final offer - $78.  It's the best I can do.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $85. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me here, but I'm afraid we're too far apart. I'm sticking to my last offer of $78. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with the other seller.",78.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $78, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $85, so I'll offer it to you for $81.50. That's the best I can do.",81.5,Alice,9,
