"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's necessary to maximize my potential earnings. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his range and can adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm eager to sell, I'm not desperate. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm starting to feel pressure, as the rounds are ticking away, but I'm not ready to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm still hopeful that I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm feeling the pressure to close a deal. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of my willingness to compromise and come to a deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as we're already halfway through the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer hasn't budged from $1,200,000, and we're already halfway through the negotiation.  I'm running out of time and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
