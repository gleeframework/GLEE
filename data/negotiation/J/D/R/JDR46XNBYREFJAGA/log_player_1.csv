{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's close to John's offer:**  If Bob rejects, you can quickly move to John and secure your minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's not close to my minimum.  I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $13,250?  This would give you a good price and still allow me to get a fair return."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's still less than I would ideally like, but it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
