Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we discuss further?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm offering $1,325,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.
