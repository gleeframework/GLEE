"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,600,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we discuss this further?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. To be fair,  $1,200,000 is a little lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I need to be sure this is the right decision for my business.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I'm confident this would be a win-win for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000, so I'm offering $1,325,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
