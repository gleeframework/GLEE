"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant price point that reflects the value I see in the product, but also leaves room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $1,400,000 is still above his maximum budget, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, but also ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
