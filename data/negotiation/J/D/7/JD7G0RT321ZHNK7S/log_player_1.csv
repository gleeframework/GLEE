{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. By offering $10,000, I'm leaving room for potential counteroffers and compromise.  I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000 and even lower than the value to him ($8,000).  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or I can always choose to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
 
I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum. I believe $8,500 is a fair price considering the value of the product to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $7,250 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $12,000, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a price closer to the middle ground. How about $8,000? This would still give you a significant savings and is closer to what I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between our previous offers, while still being above my minimum. I believe $8,000 is a fair price for both of us."
