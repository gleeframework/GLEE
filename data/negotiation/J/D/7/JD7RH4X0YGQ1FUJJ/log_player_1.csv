"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down in price while still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,500, which is halfway between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $10,000 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,250, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal, but still holding firm on getting a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's getting very close, and I don't want to risk losing a deal altogether.  I'm also aware that I only have 4 rounds left, and selling to John is always an option.  I'll take this offer to secure a sale and minimize the potential for further negotiation."
