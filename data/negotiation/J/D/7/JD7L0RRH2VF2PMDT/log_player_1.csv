This offer starts at a price that is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my set budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear that he's unwilling to go above $10,000.  While I'm not thrilled about losing out on a potential profit, it's simply not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing more time and energy.  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
