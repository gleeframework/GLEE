Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $99."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases the chance of a quicker sale and still yields a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. It creates the perception of a deal while ensuring I still make a good profit if he accepts. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise, positive, and highlights the potential value to Bob."
