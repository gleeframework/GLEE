Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.

While I could try to push for a bit more, Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity.  At $880,000, I'm still getting a significant return above my minimum, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk him walking away."
