Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting his offer of $90 is the best choice in this situation."
