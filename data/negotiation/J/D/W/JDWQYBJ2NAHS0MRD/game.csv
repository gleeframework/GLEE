"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $880,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $860,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
