"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's definitely a good starting point. However, considering the product's worth to me, I'm hoping to secure it for a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $925000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than my initial value of $1,200,000, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's important to weigh the potential savings against the risk of missing out on a valuable product. Accepting the offer ensures a win and secures the product at a good price."
