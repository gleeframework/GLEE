Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to me is $12,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I can likely get closer to my target price with more negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $11,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
