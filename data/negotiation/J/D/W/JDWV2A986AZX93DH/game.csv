"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is the highest I can go, given my current financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the benefits this product will bring you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. I understand you need to make a profit, but this price allows for a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
