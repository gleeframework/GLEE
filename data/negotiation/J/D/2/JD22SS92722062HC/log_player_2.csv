"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than the product's worth to you ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a fair price, I believe this product's true value sits higher.  Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000? This allows me to recognize its worth while still providing you a significant return on your investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than my ideal price. While it's closer to my target, I can still try to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to $850,000.  I want to avoid paying $1,000,000 to John, so I'll keep negotiating with Alice."
