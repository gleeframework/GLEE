"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in the product and represents a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit higher than your target, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value I have in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm going to have to move on to another seller.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see that you're very interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I have in the product.
