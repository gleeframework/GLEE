Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm making a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly from her initial high offer. We've already gotten close to John's price, and continuing to haggle with Alice might not yield significant savings. It's better to secure the product from John at a reasonable price than risk the negotiations with Alice stalling or ending without a deal."
