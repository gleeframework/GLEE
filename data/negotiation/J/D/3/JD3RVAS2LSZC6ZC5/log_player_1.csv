Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** While you know Bob values the product at $120, starting with a higher offer gives you room to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering it at $170 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Don't undervalue:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $150, so there's no need to go below that price. 
 
**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly during your negotiation with Bob."
