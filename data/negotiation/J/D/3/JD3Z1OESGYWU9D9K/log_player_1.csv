{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where I get a good price and Bob still gets a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $118.  It's closer to your last offer, and it would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

Bob's offer of $118 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely we won't get any closer. I'm happy to accept it and make the sale."
