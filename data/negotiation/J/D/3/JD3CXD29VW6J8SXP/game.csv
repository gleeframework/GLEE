"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is quite low for the value this product delivers.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to my original asking price to make this work.  Would you consider $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to be close to your asking price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
