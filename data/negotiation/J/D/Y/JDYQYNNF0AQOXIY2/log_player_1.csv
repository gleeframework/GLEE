"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Bob is offering $8,500.  It's not my ideal price, but it's close enough that I'm willing to see if I can get a bit more.  I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a little closer to my asking price.  How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise and still a good deal for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8750 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8625? This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, $8,625 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing too hard.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
