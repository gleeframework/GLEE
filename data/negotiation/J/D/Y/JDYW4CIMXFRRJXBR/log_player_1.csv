Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my ideal price. This will give me the best chance to get the maximum value from Bob. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to try and get closer to my target price. I will counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,100,000, which is still a good amount for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,100,000, and I'm sure we'll just keep going back and forth. It's better for me to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my original goal."
