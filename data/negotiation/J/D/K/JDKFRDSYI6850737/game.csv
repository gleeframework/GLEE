"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $120? It's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can we try to get closer to my original offer of $80? Maybe we can meet at $100? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget",100.0,Bob,4,
