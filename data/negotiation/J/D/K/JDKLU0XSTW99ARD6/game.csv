"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can offer you a compromise at $120, which is still a great price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, $90 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can offer you a slight increase to $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,5,
