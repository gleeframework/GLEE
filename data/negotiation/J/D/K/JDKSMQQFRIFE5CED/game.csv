"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. While I'm motivated to find a mutually agreeable deal, $1,800,000 is below what I can accept. Would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects the true worth and potential this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price, Alice. However, due to my financial limitations, I am unable to proceed with a purchase at $1,900,000. Could you consider bringing down the price to $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what this product brings to the table.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
