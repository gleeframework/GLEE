"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1000000. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I'm confident it aligns with your interests. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, as another buyer is prepared to purchase it for $1000000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same price as John's offer. There's no benefit to buying from Alice as there's no indication that the product is actually worth more than $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps you open to potentially finding a better deal later or negotiating with Alice if she changes her price."
