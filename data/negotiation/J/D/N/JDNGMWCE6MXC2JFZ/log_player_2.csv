{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,200,000 is well above Bob's target of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is going to start with his absolute maximum price. He's aiming for the $800,000 price that John is offering, and this will establish his desired price point early in the negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his limit. He can continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to the $800,000 mark."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is tempting, Bob is still within his 10 rounds and can potentially get a better price. He's also close to his target price, so continuing the negotiation might allow him to achieve his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his 10 rounds and is relatively close to his target price. He has a good chance of securing a price closer to his desired $800,000 by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives him a chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit with John, but he wants to see if he can get a slightly lower price from Alice.  By offering $920,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. If Alice rejects this, he'll likely accept John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his final round and has exhausted his negotiation opportunities with Alice. While $930,000 is close to his target price, it is still above his desired limit.
