"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $75 is really the highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet the minimum price of $120.  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him.  It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
