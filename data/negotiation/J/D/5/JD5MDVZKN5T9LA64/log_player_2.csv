"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value it holds for your business. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm confident this product will be a significant asset for you, so I hope you'll consider my offer.
