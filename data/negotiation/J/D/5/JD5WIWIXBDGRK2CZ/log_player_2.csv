"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, offering a significant return on investment.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's quality and its potential to generate substantial value for your business. Let's discuss this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and $1,200,000 to Bob.  Alice is offering $1,000,000 which is still too high. There's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is closer to our goals.  However, considering the product's unique capabilities and the value it brings to your operations, I believe a price of $950,000  would be a fair reflection.  This price allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still below Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000 and gives Bob a good deal."
