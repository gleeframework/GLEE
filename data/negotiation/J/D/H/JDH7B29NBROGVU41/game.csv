"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $725000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product. Let's work together to find a solution.",725000.0,Bob,4,
