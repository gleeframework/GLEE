"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would allow me to make the sale and still give you a good deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,
