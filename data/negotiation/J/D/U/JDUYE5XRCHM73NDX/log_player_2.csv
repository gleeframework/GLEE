"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Since Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, offering $25 less than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation of a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $150 to $135.  This is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept this offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely I won't get a better price and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than continue the negotiations and potentially end up paying the same or even more to John."
