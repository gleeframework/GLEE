Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $135?  It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
