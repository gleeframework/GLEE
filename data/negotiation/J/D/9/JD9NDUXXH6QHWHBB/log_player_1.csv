Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This is his likely upper limit, and he'd prefer to pay less.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,000,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit, but not so high that you alienate Bob and force him to reject your offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable:** This offer starts near the top of your acceptable range, giving you room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Confident Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without explicitly mentioning your other buyer. 
* **Leaves Room for Bob:** It doesn't anchor to your $1,000,000 minimum, allowing Bob to potentially counter-offer without feeling like he's miles away from your valuation.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could experiment with slightly different prices within the ZOPA, but going below $900,000 would significantly reduce your potential profit."
