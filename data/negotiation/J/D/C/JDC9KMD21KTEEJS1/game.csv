"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,150,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
