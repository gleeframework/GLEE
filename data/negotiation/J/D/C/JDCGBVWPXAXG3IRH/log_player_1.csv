{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to go lower. It also shows you're open to a deal, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my initial price. How about $9,500? This would allow us both to find a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and the negotiation has gone on for a while. I'm willing to accept his offer for $9,200 to avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
