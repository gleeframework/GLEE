"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your insights, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's a clear gap between your maximum and Alice's minimum, allowing for a negotiation to find a price that works for both parties. 

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer Alice with a lower price, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price would be a fair compromise and allow us to move forward with the transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your range:** $950,000 is still well within your budget of $1,200,000.
* **Significant reduction:** This counteroffer demonstrates your seriousness about negotiating and gives Alice a substantial discount from her initial offer.
* **Compromise:** The counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between Alice's desired price and your maximum willingness to pay.
* **Open to discussion:** The message invites further negotiation by asking for Alice's thoughts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value this product represents is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its potential worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **You're closer to a deal.** The negotiation is progressing, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Further negotiation is likely.** There's still a gap between your counteroffer ($950,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,050,000).  

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your $950,000. You could propose a price of $1,000,000 to show a willingness to meet halfway and potentially close the deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.
