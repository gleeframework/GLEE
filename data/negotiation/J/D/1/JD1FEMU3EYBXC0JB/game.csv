"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your insights, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price would be a fair compromise and allow us to move forward with the transaction. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value this product represents is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its potential worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would allow us to close the deal without exceeding my limits. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
