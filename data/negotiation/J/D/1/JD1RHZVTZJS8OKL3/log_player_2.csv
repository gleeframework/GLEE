It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $90."

I'm offering $85. This is a fair price as it's still above Alice's value for the product.  Let's see if she'll bite!"

Alice is trying to push the price up. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."

I'm going to offer $88.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal."

Alice is being stubborn and keeps raising her price. It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $100.  It's not the best price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
