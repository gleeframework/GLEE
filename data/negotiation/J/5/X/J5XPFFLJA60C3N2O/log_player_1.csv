"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering $95, which is closer to my minimum price. While I could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer is a reasonable compromise."
