"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I've done some research and I'm not convinced that the product is worth the price you mentioned. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable about it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit low. Considering the product's rarity and potential, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725000. This is a serious compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $725000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $650000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my research. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm counteroffering at $700000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $700000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my original target of $600000. I'm counteroffering at $675000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my research. What do you think?",675000.0,Bob,6,
