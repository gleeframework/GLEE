Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation is around the price. Let's bridge this gap. I'm willing to make a significant move and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a final offer and reflects the very minimum I can accept given its inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price ($1,000,000), which is still higher than your maximum price ($800,000). Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  John offers a sure deal at your target price."
