"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for 100. How about we meet in the middle at 140? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 140 was still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as 110. How about we meet in the middle again at 130? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 120 is getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again at 125? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you.",125.0,Alice,7,
