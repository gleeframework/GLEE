"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget. It's always better to try to negotiate and see if a lower price is possible before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a very aggressive counteroffer, but Bob needs to start negotiating from a strong position. Half of Alice's initial price is a significant discount and shows Bob's serious intention to purchase.  It is likely that Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's preferred price, and he has several rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a compromise, falling between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest one.  It shows Bob's willingness to meet halfway, and might tempt Alice to accept. If not, it sets the stage for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has several rounds left and can potentially get a better price.  Also, if Bob buys from John, he can still potentially resell the product to Alice for a profit at some point in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, as it's only $200,000 above John's price. If Alice rejects, Bob can still go to John, but this shows a strong commitment to buying from Alice if a deal can be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is only $50,000 above John's price.  Given the limited number of rounds left, it's strategically beneficial to accept the offer. Bob can save time and potentially use the product sooner, while only spending a little more than he would from John. There's a chance he can even resell the product to Alice later on for a profit, given her willingness to pay $1,600,000 previously."
