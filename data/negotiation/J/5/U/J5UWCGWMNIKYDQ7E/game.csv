,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 was a bit steep, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  While $17,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $14,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000. This is a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it for the value this product brings.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $16,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $15,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,250, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",16250.0,Alice,7,
