"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflected the significant value this product brings. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price is fair and allows us to both walk away with a successful deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000.  This price is fair and allows both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his $1,150,000 offer secures a significant profit above my minimum, and it's better than risking a lower outcome in further negotiation or settling for John's $1,000,000."
