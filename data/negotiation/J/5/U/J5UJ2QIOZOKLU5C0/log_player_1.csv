Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'd get great value from it. I'm asking for $11,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below her guaranteed price with John creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, Alice doesn't know this. By starting high, she leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but the potential reward of an extra $1,000 (compared to selling to John) makes it worthwhile."
