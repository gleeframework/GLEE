"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1000000. I'm confident this is a great deal for you, but I understand if it's not the right price for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  This means you can save $500,000 by accepting Alice's offer. While you don't know the product's true value to Alice, the fact that she's willing to sell for less than your maximum budget indicates a potential good deal."
