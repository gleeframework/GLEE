"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $1000000. I'm confident this is a great deal for you, but I understand if it's not the right price for you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
