Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,162,500?

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting very close to John's price. While Alice might still be willing to negotiate a bit further down, the potential savings are getting smaller and riskier. It's time to push a bit harder to see if a significantly better deal can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm ready to close this deal today, but I need you to meet me a bit closer to my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $1,133,437? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1133437} 

**Reasoning:** This offer maintains the downward negotiation trend but introduces a sense of urgency and finality. By stating it's your final offer, you're signaling a strong stance while still leaving room for Alice to potentially accept a price lower than John's."
