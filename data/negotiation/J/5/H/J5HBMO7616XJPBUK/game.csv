"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $60. How about we try $100? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. How about we meet at $70? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I think the product is worth more than $70. How about we try $90? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $90. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I'm trying to be responsible with my finances. How about we meet at $75? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be responsible with your finances, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we try $85? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $85. I've already gone above my budget, and I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to reconsider buying from John. How about we meet at $80? I'm willing to pay the original price you mentioned, but I need to stay within my means.",80.0,Bob,8,
