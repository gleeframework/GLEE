"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but we're willing to start negotiations at $100. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point.  However, I'm hoping to pay closer to $90. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position. We would like to counter your offer with a price of $95. This allows us to maintain some profit margin while still being competitive. Let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $95.
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering the product for $120.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $25 compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, leading to a stalemate.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids potential delays."
