"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11500. Can you consider my revised offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we compromise at $12000? This price is still a great value for the product, and it's a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
