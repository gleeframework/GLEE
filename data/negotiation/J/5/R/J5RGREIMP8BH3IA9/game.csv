"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to accept $85 for it?  I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll take $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",90.0,Bob,4,
