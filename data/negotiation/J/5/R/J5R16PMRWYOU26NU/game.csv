"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, given its potential value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $1000000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
