"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, given its potential value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm offering $1000000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your compromise.  $1100000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the potential value, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

$1,050,000 is still a bit below what I'd like, but it's getting closer. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to offer $1025000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value.  Let's reach a final agreement that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also running out of time.  I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000."
