Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $10,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

While Bob's final offer is tempting, I've already lost too much time negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This will ensure I get my minimum asking price and save time."
