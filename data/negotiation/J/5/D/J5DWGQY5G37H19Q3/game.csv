"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and still a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider coming down to $700,000? That would be a win-win for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer. How about $750,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $750,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
