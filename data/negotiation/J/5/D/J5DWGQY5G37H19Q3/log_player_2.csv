"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you and still a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider coming down to $700,000? That would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 700000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $700,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to move a bit closer. How about $750,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $750,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best possible outcome! Alice has come down to her minimum price, which is a great deal for you. It's better to accept this offer than to risk pushing for a lower price and potentially losing out."
