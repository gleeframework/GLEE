"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $140?  That's a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $140 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I can only go up to $135. That's the best I can do.",135.0,Bob,6,
