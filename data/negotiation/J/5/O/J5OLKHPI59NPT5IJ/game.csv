"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $175 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to  $50. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $50 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to negotiating further. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $125 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $75? That would work much better for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up a bit more, how about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
