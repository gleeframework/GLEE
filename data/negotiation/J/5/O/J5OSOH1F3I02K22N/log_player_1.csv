"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to budge at all.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth the risk of losing out on a higher offer from John. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway by offering $10,000. This is still higher than his offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. It's better to risk losing Bob and proceed to the next round than to accept a lower offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $10,500. This is a small increase, but it shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, while also maintaining a firm position. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further, and I'm still prepared to sell to John if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at his perceived value of $8,000, which is still too low for me.  While I could continue to negotiate,  I'm starting to run out of rounds and the risk of ending up with nothing is too high.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and sell for $15,000."
