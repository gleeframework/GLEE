"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the quality and what you're getting out of it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree it's a good product, $10,500 is still more than I had budgeted for. Would you consider $7,500?  That's a strong offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to make my final offer at $9,000. This is already a significant reduction, and I need to be fair to myself on the value of what I'm selling.",9000.0,Alice,5,
