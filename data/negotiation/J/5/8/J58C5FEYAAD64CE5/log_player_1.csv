Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a higher price initially, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, he's more likely to accept a price closer to your initial offer than if you started low.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
