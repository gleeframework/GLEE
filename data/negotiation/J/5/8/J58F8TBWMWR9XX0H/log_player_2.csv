"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to get an even lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by $50,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. However, it's still within a reasonable range, considering the product's worth to me and the fact that we have 9 rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is closer to my ideal price.  While I could try to push for a lower offer, accepting this offer would save me $75,000 compared to buying from John. With 7 rounds left, I'm willing to close the deal now and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
