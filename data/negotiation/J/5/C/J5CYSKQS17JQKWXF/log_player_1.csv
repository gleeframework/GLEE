Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning  ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" might make Bob perceive a higher value than $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control and potentially increasing the final price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a (slim) chance to buy the product."
