Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer before engaging with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd rather sell than have the product sit, $8,000 is a significant loss for me. I'm going to counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."

I'm countering with $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm countering again with $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  While I'd like to see if we can reach a deal, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and don't want to risk ending up with a price below my minimum. John is a guaranteed sale at $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell to John."
