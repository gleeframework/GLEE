"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a very good price, but it's worth exploring if Alice might be willing to go lower. There's still a lot of room to negotiate before reaching your $15,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  I'm still well within my budget at $4,500, leaving room for potential compromises."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,250 is closer to my target price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to try a slightly lower counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to overpay.  I'm hoping she'll see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my ideal price, and we're now only $500 apart.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation and potential deal collapse is high. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price, well below my budget, and saves me time and energy."
