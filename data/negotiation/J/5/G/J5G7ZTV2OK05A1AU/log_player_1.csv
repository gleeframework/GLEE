{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a starting point. By offering $175, I'm aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value but still within a range where negotiation is possible. This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it's closer to my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's getting closer. It's also possible that Bob won't budge further, and I could risk losing the sale and having to settle for $150 from John. Accepting Bob's offer at this point seems like the most pragmatic choice, maximizing my profit while ensuring a sale."
