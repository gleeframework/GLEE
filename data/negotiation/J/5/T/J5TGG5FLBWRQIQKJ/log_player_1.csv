"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

This strategy starts with a strong initial offer above your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize your potential profit.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could try to negotiate for more, Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the sale now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
