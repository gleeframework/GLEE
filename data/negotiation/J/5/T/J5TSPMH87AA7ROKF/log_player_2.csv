**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum budget and John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a significant risk Alice won't budge, forcing you to buy from John at $1,000,000 anyway. Taking John's offer now guarantees you get the product at the best price you've secured."
