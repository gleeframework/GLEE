I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a good profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still more than what Bob is currently offering. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make me comfortable. I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John.  It's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my price point, and I don't want to risk further negotiation."
