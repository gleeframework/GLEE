"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I could consider letting it go for $2,100,000.  This is a compromise, but I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,600,000 is significantly below market value for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,950,000.  This offer stands until the end of the next round, after which I'll need to explore other options.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
