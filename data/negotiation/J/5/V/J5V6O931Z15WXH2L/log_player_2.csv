"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is within your budget, you can get the product for a better price from John ($10,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you leave open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John at your preferred maximum price."
