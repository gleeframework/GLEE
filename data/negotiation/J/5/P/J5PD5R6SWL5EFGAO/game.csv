,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
