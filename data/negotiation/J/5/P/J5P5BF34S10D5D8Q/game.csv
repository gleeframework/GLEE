"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price, reflecting the product's value and allowing for a reasonable profit for you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low considering the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet in the middle. How about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
