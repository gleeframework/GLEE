Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my research and the market value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price, reflecting the product's value and allowing for a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
