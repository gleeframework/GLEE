# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product could greatly benefit you and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $1,150,000 is better than John's price, it's still above my maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for negotiation, and I have 10 rounds to try and get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above my target price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have several rounds left, and I can continue to negotiate to get a price closer to my desired $1,050,000. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** I can always purchase from John if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."
