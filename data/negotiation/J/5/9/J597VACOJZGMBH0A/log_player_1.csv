"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product could greatly benefit you and I'm pleased to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering its potential value."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,150,000 is slightly under Bob's perceived value, making it tempting while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate down if needed.
* **Confident & Positive:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly above your minimum price. While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit, you have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to your initial asking price. You're willing to engage in further rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is showing flexibility by lowering her price, but not drastically. This signals that she's willing to negotiate but also values her product.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the middle of the initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This can encourage Bob to see it as a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes fairness and a ""win-win"" situation, maintaining a good negotiating atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $1,120,000 is still too high. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to pay $1,085,000, which reflects a fair compromise for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Bob withdrawing altogether. Accepting now secures the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further counteroffers might only yield small increases in price, making it not worth the risk of losing the sale."
