{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging. 
* **Clear value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob. 

I'm using a strategy of starting high and being willing to negotiate, but with a clear floor price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and continue negotiating to reach a mutually agreeable price, always keeping my minimum price in mind.  If negotiations stall, I can always choose to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is a significant improvement, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a fair price. This can encourage Bob to make a more competitive offer.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll keep a close eye on my minimum price and be prepared to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,050 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm confident this product will deliver great value for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing my commitment to finding a fair price.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** $11,500 is still above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum price of $15,000.

I'm aiming for a more mutually agreeable price while still maintaining a reasonable margin for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $11,000 is the most I can afford. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not enough:** While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price and potentially ending up with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum price, ensuring a profit and avoiding the potential for a lower price with Bob.

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the most sensible decision. It ensures a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of further negotiations that could result in a lower price."
