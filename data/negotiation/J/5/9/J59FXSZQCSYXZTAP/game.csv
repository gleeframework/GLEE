"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1800000 for the product. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a substantial investment for me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1200000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $900000, which is $1050000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
