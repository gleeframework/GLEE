Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you were looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer. If you're interested, please let me know.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate further. You have room to bargain before reaching John's price of $1,500,000."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While it's not the absolute lowest you could potentially get, it's a good compromise.  At this price, you're still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away, leaving you with only John's higher price as an option."
