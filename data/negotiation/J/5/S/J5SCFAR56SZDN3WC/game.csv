"Thank you for sharing your unique product with me, Alice. After considering its potential value, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm still confident this product holds significantly more value than $1000000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000. This gives you a great deal while still allowing me to recoup a fair price.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Considering the product's potential value, I would like to counter with an offer of $1100000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $1100000 is still quite a bit below what I believe this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1200000 as a final compromise. This reflects the unique value proposition of this product and also ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
