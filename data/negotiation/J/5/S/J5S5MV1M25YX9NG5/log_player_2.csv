# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially beneficial option."
