"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more realistic price. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more realistic price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that this product is worth significantly more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still trying to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
