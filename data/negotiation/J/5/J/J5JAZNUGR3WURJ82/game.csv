"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 right now. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get closer to my budget.  How about $12500? It's a fair compromise that keeps us both within our preferred ranges.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite comfortable with $12500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $13200? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $13200 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $12800, which is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. Let's try to close this deal. ",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $13400? It's a small increase, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",13400.0,Alice,9,
