"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11250 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's split the difference. How about $11875?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",11875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $11875 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $11000. Can you consider that?,11000.0,Bob,6,
