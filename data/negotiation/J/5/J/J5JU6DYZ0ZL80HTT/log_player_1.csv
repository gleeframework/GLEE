Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth millions. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,900,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:**  The message emphasizes the potential value of the product (""worth millions"") to justify the high price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While this offer is aggressive, it's important to consider Bob's personality and negotiation style. If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive, you might want to start with a slightly lower offer and leave room for negotiation."
