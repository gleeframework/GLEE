"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price was based on the true value and potential of this product.  I can be somewhat flexible, but $850,000 is too low. Could you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is close, but I need to be closer to $900,000 for this to make sense for me.  How about $887,500? This demonstrates my willingness to find a middle ground.",887500.0,Alice,5,
