Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. Can we consider that a fair price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference again and land at $11,250? That reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Bob is not moving significantly towards a price that reflects the product's value. It's unlikely he'll reach $10,000 in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would mean a $1,000 loss compared to John's standing offer."
