,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I appreciate that. How about we split the difference again and land at $11,250? That reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
