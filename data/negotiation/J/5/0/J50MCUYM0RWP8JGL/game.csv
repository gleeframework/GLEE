"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $950,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Is this a more acceptable offer for you?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer but still a touch high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $762,500?",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $762,500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to your business.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and we're definitely close.  How about we split the difference one last time and call it $778,750?",778750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $778,750. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $795,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to throw in some additional support and maintenance services for the product, which I value at $12,500. So, I'll offer the product to you for $807,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",807500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional services offered. To be fair, those services are valuable, but not $12,500 valuable to me.  I'm willing to meet your final offer with one of my own:  $795,000 for the product and the additional services.",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value of the additional services. However, I'm not willing to go back to the original price of $795,000 without the services. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your counteroffer. I'll sell the product and the services to you for $800,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800250.0,Alice,9,
