Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good deal and gets me closer to my goal of $1,000,000.  I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and then potentially having to accept a lower offer from John in the next round."
