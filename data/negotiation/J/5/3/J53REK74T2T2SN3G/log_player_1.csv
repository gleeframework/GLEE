Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  How about a price of $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $100 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This price point represents a fair deal for both parties. You earn significantly more than selling to John, and Bob gets the product for $20 less than its value to him."
