"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I'm sure you'll agree is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,100,000 from Alice, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **It's within your budget.**  The $1,100,000 price is less than your $1,500,000 limit."
