"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1100000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can still potentially save more money.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but you're still closer to your goal of saving money. By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your ideal price of $1,000,000. Remember, you have the option to buy from John for that price if you can't negotiate a better deal with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there yet. I can offer $1,000,000, which is my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but she's still above your ideal price of $1,000,000. Since you can buy the product from John for that amount, it's the most financially sound decision.  You've negotiated with Alice and gotten a good price, but John offers the best deal right now."
