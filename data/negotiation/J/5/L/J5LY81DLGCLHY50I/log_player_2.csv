# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  While I want to make this deal work, I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly. How about we split the difference and agree on $850,000?  This gives you a great deal and ensures I get a reasonable return on my product. Let's make this happen!
