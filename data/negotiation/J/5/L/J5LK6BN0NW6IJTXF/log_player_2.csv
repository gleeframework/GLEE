"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to accept a price above that. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counteroffer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  We acknowledge Alice's offer and express interest in the product.
* **Firm but reasonable:** We clearly state that $120 is too high, but we offer a price that's a significant jump from Alice's starting point while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Strategic:** By starting lower, we give ourselves space to potentially meet in the middle, closer to a price we find acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $80 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price that's a good deal compared to buying from John. There's room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Continued Appreciation:**  We maintain a positive tone by acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($80) and her current one ($95) with a slight lean towards our desired price. This shows we're willing to move but also holds firm on getting a significant discount. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** We're getting closer to John's price. While we don't explicitly mention John, Alice might sense that we have an alternative and could walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not quite there with $85, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $90, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that $90 is her final offer. While we could try to push for $87 or $88, it's getting risky. She might walk away, and we'd end up paying $100 to John. Accepting $90 secures a $10 discount, which is a decent outcome in this negotiation."
