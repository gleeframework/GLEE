"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a price of $130. I know you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $130. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for less.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $110?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $120, which is a good price considering my maximum is $150. It's worth accepting this offer before she changes her mind or I run out of rounds."
