"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we settle on $15000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $13500 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14000? I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I'm still not convinced that $13000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product.",14500.0,Alice,7,
