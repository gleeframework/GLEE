Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested but would need to come in lower. How about $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is still above John's price, but significantly lower than Alice's offer. This demonstrates my interest in the product while also showing I'm serious about negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still trying to find a way to make it work. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but still keeping it within my budget. I'm also emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage Alice to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but $12,800 is still too high. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to squeeze out the last bit of value, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I can sell the product to you for $12,500. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $12,500 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $12,100. This feels fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to Alice's price, but still keeping it within my budget. I'm hoping to close the deal in these last few rounds. By suggesting splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise and that I believe we're both close to a deal."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can sell the product to you for $12,300. It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $12,300 is still over my budget and there's only one round left.  It's too risky to continue negotiating, as I might not be able to get a lower price and I could end up not buying the product at all. It's more secure to buy the product from John for $10,000 and save myself the risk and frustration of a potentially failed negotiation."
