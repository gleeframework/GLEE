"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to quickly find a middle ground. Offering $10,000 shows serious interest while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. While $11,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal, it's a good deal considering he's already saved $500 from Alice's initial offer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product without further risk of negotiation.  The potential savings of another $1,500 from continuing negotiation aren't worth the risk of either Alice rejecting further offers or Bob losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a higher price."
