"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's getting closer to what I need, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and we can finalize the transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your continued interest, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I need.  Let's meet halfway at $1,375,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 for one final time. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
