"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  The price is below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000), giving me flexibility to make counteroffers if needed.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  While it's closer, $1,200,000 is still $300,000 less than what I need to get from this sale.
* **I have 8 rounds left.** There's still time to negotiate and try to get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000.** This is my safety net, but I want to maximize my profit if possible.

```

**Reasoning:**

```

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 for one final time. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my ""absolute bottom line"" to create a sense of urgency and signal that I'm serious about closing the deal.

* **Creating urgency:**  By calling this my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
