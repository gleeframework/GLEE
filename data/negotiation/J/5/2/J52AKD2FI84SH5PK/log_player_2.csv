Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and you're better off securing the deal with John at your target price."
