"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product looks promising, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  Would you be open to that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial investment. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the details of the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm getting close to my limit, but I think we can make a deal. How about $950,000?  That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
