"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm definitely interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe the product's value is worth it. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $8,200 is still a little more than I'd like to spend.  How about $7,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $8,100. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe the product's value is worth it. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
