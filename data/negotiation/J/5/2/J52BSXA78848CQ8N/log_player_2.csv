"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $12,000 doesn't achieve that.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price from Alice in the next round. Buying from John immediately offers no benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $9,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the tone that I'm serious about negotiating and hoping to achieve a significant discount.  Alice's initial offer was your maximum, so lowering it to $9,000 creates a large bargaining space while still representing a significant value to me. This will give Alice a good incentive to counter, allowing for a more balanced negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my desired price point.  While it's a decent reduction from her initial offer, I still believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring a lower price. Buying from John at this point offers no advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer represents a more reasonable midpoint between our current positions.  It increases the chances of reaching an agreement while still remaining within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still determined to see if I can get a better deal.  Alice has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a lower price.  Buying from John at this point is not beneficial as I'm potentially only $500 away from my desired price.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $10,250. This represents a modest increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better deal. I believe Alice will be more likely to accept this offer as it is closer to her last offer, and it leaves room for a final adjustment if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is now at my desired price point.  It's a great deal, and accepting this offer will allow me to secure the product while saving $2,000 compared to buying from John. I don't want to risk a further decrease in Alice's willingness to negotiate, so I'm going to accept her offer and close the deal."
