"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've started with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still shows I'm serious about buying the product. This gives Alice room to counter without feeling like they're giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly my maximum budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be stuck with the option of buying from John at the same price.  It's better to accept and avoid further negotiation."
