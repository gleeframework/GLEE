# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This still gives you a great deal, considering the product's value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. We started quite low, so Alice knows we're willing to bargain."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
