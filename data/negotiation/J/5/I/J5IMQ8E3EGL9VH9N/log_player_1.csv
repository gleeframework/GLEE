Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly closer to our minimum price, but we have plenty of rounds to negotiate and can likely get closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe my initial valuation is closer to the true worth of this product, considering its unique aspects and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  This offer represents a significant opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We are getting close, and $1,950,000 is tempting. However, Bob's willingness to meet halfway suggests there's still room for negotiation. Let's push a little further while we still have rounds to spare."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect your approach. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $2,025,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your interest."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's latest offer is a significant increase from his previous offer and puts him very close to our desired price range. It's unlikely we'll be able to push him much further, and we risk losing him as a buyer if we push too hard. Accepting this offer is the most strategically sound option at this point."
