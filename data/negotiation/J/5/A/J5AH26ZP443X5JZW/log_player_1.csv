"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone in the message encourages a collaborative negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value of the deal for Bob might make him more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, it does show he's interested and willing to negotiate. I have room to counter with a higher price.
* **Exploring Options:** Selling to John at this point would secure my desired price, but I want to see if I can get closer to it through negotiation with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $900,000 but lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000.  The goal is to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but I can't go any lower.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,000,000. This shows I'm flexible and willing to find a solution.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that $1,000,000 is my final offer.  This creates pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation open and collaborative.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** The deal is closed at $1,000,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will need to assess whether to accept a lower counteroffer from Bob or sell to John.  I'll need to weigh the potential loss of revenue against the risk of losing Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I can meet you in the middle at $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John at this point would secure my ideal price. However, I'm only four rounds into the negotiation, and there's still potential to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and potentially push him further towards a more agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $950,000, but potentially lower than my previous offer of $1,000,000, aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired price. I need to carefully consider how much lower I'm willing to go while still ensuring a profitable deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation,  $950,000 is still a bit too low.  To make this work, I'm willing to lower my price to $975,000. This is a final offer, as I'm also considering other opportunities.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm reiterating that I'm considering other opportunities (John) to show Bob that I'm serious and not desperate.
* **Finality:**  I'm calling this a ""final offer"" to signal that I'm nearing the end of my willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's current offer, aiming for a compromise that could work for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  The deal is closed at $975,000. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I will need to weigh my options carefully. Selling to John would guarantee my desired price but potentially lose a valuable customer like Bob.  I may need to accept a lower counteroffer from Bob or risk losing both opportunities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $975,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're only halfway through the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of lowering the price further and potentially losing valuable time.
* **Secure the Desired Price:** Selling to John guarantees my desired price of $1,200,000, which is far more beneficial than potentially settling for a lower offer from Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the remaining rounds and Bob's continued reluctance to meet my minimum price, it's more advantageous to secure a guaranteed high price by selling to John.  While it might be possible to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the future, it's too risky at this point."
