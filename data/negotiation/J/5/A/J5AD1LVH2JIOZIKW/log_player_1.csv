Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm starting with the highest possible price I'm willing to accept, which is $120. This is my baseline, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'm ready to negotiate, but I'll always keep in mind that I can sell to John for $120 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, it's worth at least $120 to me.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $110. This is a compromise, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price, and that he'll be willing to accept it. If not, I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $120 if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can't get a better offer from him.  This is a good deal for both of us."
