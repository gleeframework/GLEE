,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about we settle on $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $115? That's a good compromise and I'm pretty sure I can make it work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I can make a decent profit. How about we meet at $125? It's still a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
