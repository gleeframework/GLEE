Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging interest:**  A high price will help you assess Bob's seriousness.  If he flat out rejects it, you know he might not be willing to pay close to your minimum. If he counters, you can negotiate down towards a more agreeable price.
* **Profit maximization:** Your goal is to get as much as possible. While Bob values it at $8,000, he might be willing to stretch his budget, especially if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always make a new one closer to $15,000, ensuring you don't miss out on a sale."
