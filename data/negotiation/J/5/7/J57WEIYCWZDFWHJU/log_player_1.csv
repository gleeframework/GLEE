Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $100 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is still more than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while still protecting your minimum profit threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum of $120.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to negotiate a higher price and still have the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $95. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $95 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum, it's still below it.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try and push for a slightly higher price, while still having the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
