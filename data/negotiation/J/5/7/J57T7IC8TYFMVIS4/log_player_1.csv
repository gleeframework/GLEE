Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
