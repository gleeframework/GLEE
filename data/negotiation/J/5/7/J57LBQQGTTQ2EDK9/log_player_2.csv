{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range. It demonstrates your interest in the product while pushing for a price closer to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my maximum budget.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer, as it's at your maximum budget. It clearly states your willingness to pay $10,000, but no higher. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or reject the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above your budget, and you only have 5 rounds left.  While the offer is tempting, you can try one more round to see if you can get a better price before going with John.  You've shown Alice you're serious about buying, but also that you're firm on your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This offer moves you closer to Alice's price but still stays within your comfort zone.
* **Appeal to fairness:** Highlighting that it's a ""fair price for both of us"" subtly encourages Alice to accept.
* **Last chance:** This is likely your last chance to negotiate with Alice before you have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $12500. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above your budget. While you have two more rounds, it's risky to continue negotiating. With only two rounds left, you might not have enough time to reach a satisfactory price.  John's offer is your guaranteed option, and you're saving $2,500 compared to Alice's current offer. It's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure the product within your budget."
