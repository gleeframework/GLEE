Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Since I have the option to reject his offer and proceed to the next round, I'll choose to do so. I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but lower than my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
{""counteroffer"": $700,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $600,000, I'll increase the price by $20,000 and send him a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a reasonable compromise that's still lower than my minimum price of $800,000.

{""product_price"": $700,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I've already made a counteroffer of $700,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer that's closer to my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
