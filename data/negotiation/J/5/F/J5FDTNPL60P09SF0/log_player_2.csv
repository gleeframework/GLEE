"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have 10 rounds, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I have 10 rounds, so I can be patient and see how Alice responds to my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial offer, but it's still higher than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, as I still have 7 rounds left and I'm confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $875,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price. However, it's still a significant discount from her last offer. 

I'm also considering that we are already halfway through the negotiation process, and I want to make sure I don't run out of time to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price above my target, and I have 5 rounds left. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with her.  I'm not ready to give up yet, as I'm still closer to my desired price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, this time to $890,000. This is a smaller increment than before, showing Alice that I'm getting closer to her price.  I'm still not willing to go above my target, but I believe this offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal. 

With only 4 rounds left, I need to move strategically to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm running out of time. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and I only have 3 rounds left. The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might reject my next offer and I would have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure a deal now, even if it's not my ideal price."
