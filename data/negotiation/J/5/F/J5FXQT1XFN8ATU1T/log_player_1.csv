{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product.  I'm asking for $14,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to do $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me right now. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? "", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13250 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $13000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really keen to get this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $13,000 is a good compromise, and it's still a better deal than selling to John for $15,000.  I'm confident I can find another buyer for this type of product in the future."
