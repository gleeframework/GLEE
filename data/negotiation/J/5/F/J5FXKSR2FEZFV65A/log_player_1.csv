{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially close the deal, while also ensuring I don't undervalue my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum and closer to my initial offer.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer at $100. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I still want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is waiting in the wings with a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. $100 is still a bit low for me, but to show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's very close to my minimum, but still leaves a small profit margin.  I'm also making it clear that this is my final offer, putting the pressure on Bob to decide."
