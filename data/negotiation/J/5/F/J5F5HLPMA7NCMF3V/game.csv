"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is the best I can do, let's see if we can close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
