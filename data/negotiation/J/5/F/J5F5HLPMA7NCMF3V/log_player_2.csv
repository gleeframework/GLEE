"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own value of the product, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price closer to your maximum budget but still leaving room for further negotiation. It also acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses interest in the product, making the counteroffer more persuasive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  However, it is closer to your price range and shows that she is willing to negotiate. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is the best I can do, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that you are serious about buying the product but are still trying to get the best possible price.  Offering a price that is only slightly higher than your previous counteroffer demonstrates that you are willing to compromise.  By stating that this is your best offer, you put pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
