Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This offer aims to maximize profit while still considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Here's why:

* **Reasoning:**  I'm offering $2,000,000, significantly higher than John's offer. This gives Bob a potential for a good deal, but it also reflects the value I place on the product. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. This means I'm willing to gamble on Bob potentially valuing the product even higher.

By offering a higher price, I'm trying to incentivize Bob to accept. However, I'm also protecting myself with the backup offer from John."
