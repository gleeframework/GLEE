"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. We can potentially save more money by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.  We have 10 rounds, so there's ample time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it does seem promising, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This feels like a more fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a range that's potentially acceptable to both of us. It also sets a clear expectation that I'm serious about getting a lower price, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to reject her offer and continue to negotiate. There's still some wiggle room, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I have time on my side with 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing I'm approaching a compromise.  It's still below my ideal price, but it's a reasonable offer that acknowledges Alice's position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with your budget. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, it's close enough that it's worth accepting.  I've saved a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John, and with only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
