Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount, but I need to be careful not to push him away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. It's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving and keeps me from losing a potential sale.  I'll see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and I don't want to continue a lengthy negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
