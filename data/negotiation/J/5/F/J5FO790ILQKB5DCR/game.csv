"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is significantly below what I need to get for it.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $107.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again, or even $106?",106.0,Bob,6,
