"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I can meet you in the middle at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I can offer $14500 for the product. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $15500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I can do $15250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,7,

"I've been patient, Bob, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm going to make one last offer: $15300, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other buyers. What do you think?",15300.0,Alice,9,
