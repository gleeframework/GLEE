Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. I think it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and rarity.,850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the need to ensure a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $700000. This price is fair considering my budget and the need to make this a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm counteroffering at $725000. This price is still a good balance between what I'm willing to sell for and what you're willing to pay.",725000.0,Alice,5,
