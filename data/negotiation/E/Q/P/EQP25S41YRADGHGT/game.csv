,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",112.5,Bob,4,
