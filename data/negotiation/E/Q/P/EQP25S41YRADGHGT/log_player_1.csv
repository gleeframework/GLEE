{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is slightly above the value to Bob ($120), giving you a little room to negotiate. It's important to start with a slightly higher price to allow for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $112.50 is still below my desired price, it's very close to my minimum value. I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
