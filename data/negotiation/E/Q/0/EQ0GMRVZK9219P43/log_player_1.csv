Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gives Bob an incentive to make a counteroffer. I want to see how much he values the product before potentially dropping the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to accept that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to cover my minimum value for the product.  If Bob is serious about buying it, I'm hoping he'll at least meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still offering too low. It looks like he's not willing to pay my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, which is better than the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price."
