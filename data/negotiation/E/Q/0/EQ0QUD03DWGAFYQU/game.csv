"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $100? This feels like a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
