# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than its face value of $120. Considering its exceptional features and the benefits it offers, I propose to sell it to you for $150. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the added value we believe you will derive from using it. I trust this offer will be mutually beneficial. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150.
