"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit, given the product's value to you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  How about we try $650,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and gives us some more room to negotiate.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $650,000 is still not enough for me. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to reach a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
