"I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $160 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $145. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $145 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $152.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",152.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $152.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $145. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price.",145.0,Bob,6,
