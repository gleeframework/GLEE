Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price point. We're still significantly above what John is offering, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can push a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To show you I'm serious about making this work, let's settle on $1,300,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary.  
* **Time constraint:** We're getting close to the halfway point in our negotiation rounds.  It's a good time to signal urgency and see if Bob is willing to move closer to our position. 
* **Profit margin:** $1,300,000 still represents a substantial profit over John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit below my target. How about we settle on $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are minimal at this point. Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and we risk losing the deal altogether by playing too hardball. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** $1,225,000 is still a $25,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's a solid return and better to secure a good deal now.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner rather than later has its own value. It allows us to redeploy our resources and potentially pursue other opportunities."
