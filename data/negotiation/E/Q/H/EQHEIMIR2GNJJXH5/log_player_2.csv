"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's much higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be useful to me, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider a significantly lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This might seem aggressive, but it establishes a negotiation range.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but it's firm in stating that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying ""significantly lower,"" we leave room for Alice to counter, encouraging her to stay in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $110 is still significantly above our budget and our ideal price of $80 from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we can get the price lower. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about our budget and encourage her to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we try to find a compromise closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Transparent:**  We're being more direct about our target price range by mentioning $80.
* **Testing the Waters:**  A $75 counteroffer sees how close we can get to our ideal price while leaving a little room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  We want to keep the conversation amicable and solution-oriented, even while standing firm on our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Not Enough:** Alice is moving closer to our range, but $92.50 is still a significant difference from our $80 alternative with John.
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While we have time, we don't want to drag it out if Alice is only making small concessions. 
* **Maintain Firmness:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting closer to our price range and won't easily settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to see a price that works for my budget.  Would you consider $80? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're now directly stating our backup price of $80. This clearly signals our limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying this is the ""absolute highest,"" we convey a sense of urgency and that we're reaching a decision point. 
* **Final Offer (Almost):** While we haven't explicitly said ""final offer,"" this strongly implies it.  We leave a tiny bit of room in case Alice counters with a price very close to $80, but otherwise, we're ready to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unlikely to budge much further from her $90 offer. She's signaled this is near her minimum.
* **Minimal Savings:** Even if we could negotiate Alice down a little more, the potential savings are small compared to John's guaranteed $80 price. 
* **Time Value:** We've already spent several rounds, and further haggling might only yield a few dollars in savings.  It's more efficient to take John's offer now."
