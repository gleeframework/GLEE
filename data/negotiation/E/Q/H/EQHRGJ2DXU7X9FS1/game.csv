"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,100,000?  Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $950,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
