Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This price is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still being above your minimum value.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start a conversation and gauge Bob's interest. 

This approach allows you to:

* **Start high:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **Show flexibility:** The message indicates you're open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Keep your options open:** You can always accept John's offer of $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum value, it's still below what you're hoping for. Rejecting allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:**  You can try to bridge the gap and potentially get a better price.
* **Explore further:** You can learn more about Bob's motivations and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting immediately, you maintain your position and don't settle for the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit lower than I can go at this point. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** We're proposing a price that's halfway between your initial offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** We're not just throwing out a number. We're providing a justification (""fair price that reflects the value"") for our counteroffer. This makes it more likely that Bob will take it seriously. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and conversational tone helps keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $10500? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is just above your minimum value of $10,000.  Here's why accepting is the best choice:

* **Profit:** You're securing a profit of $500, which is better than selling to John for $10,000.
* **Time:** Accepting avoids further negotiation rounds, saving you time.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though you're getting a lower price than initially hoped, a successful deal with Bob can lead to future sales or collaborations. 

While you could try to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal entirely (by going back and forth or ultimately selling to John) outweighs the potential gain."
