"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to maximize my profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a significant markup on my minimum price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'm hoping for a better deal, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but still aim for a significant profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to keep negotiating, hoping to get a better price. I'm still optimistic that I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm only willing to go down to $8,500. I'm hoping that this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer once more, and if that doesn't work, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping that Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of time.  It's better to secure the $8,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having the negotiation completely fall apart."
