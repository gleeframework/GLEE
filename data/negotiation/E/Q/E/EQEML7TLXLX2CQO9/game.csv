,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $92.50.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being flexible, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product! I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $89, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for it. Can we meet at $89?",89.0,Alice,5,
