Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give it away. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to secure the $8,000 deal with John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
