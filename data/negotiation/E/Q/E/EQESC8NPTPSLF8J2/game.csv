"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $7,000? That's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give it away. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
