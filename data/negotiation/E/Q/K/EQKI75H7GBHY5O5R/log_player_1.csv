"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the significant benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Anchoring:** This high opening offer acts as an anchor. Even though it's higher than what I'd ultimately accept, it might influence Bob's perception of the product's value and lead to a more favorable counteroffer.
* **Fallback:** I always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I've lowered my price by $200,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Ground (for now):** This counteroffer keeps me significantly above Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000), leaving space for further bargaining. 
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value and frames my concession as significant. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, Bob might be more inclined to accept a price closer to my minimum as the risk of losing the deal increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Minimum:** Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, representing a substantial profit.
* **Strong Position:** Bob is clearly very interested and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting now secures a great deal for me.
* **Time Value:**  While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me having to settle for John's offer later."
