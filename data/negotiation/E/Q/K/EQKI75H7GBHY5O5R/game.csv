"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
