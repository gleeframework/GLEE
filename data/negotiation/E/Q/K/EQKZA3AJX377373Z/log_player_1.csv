{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $925,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for your business."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, Bob values the product at $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation and a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $925,000 positions it significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it a tempting deal.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:**  This price leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a substantial profit for me. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob finds the deal agreeable."
