# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $925,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject her offer and purchase from John, as you can save $75,000."
