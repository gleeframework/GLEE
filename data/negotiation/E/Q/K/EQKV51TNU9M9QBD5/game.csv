"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $8,750? This would be a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $8,750 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
