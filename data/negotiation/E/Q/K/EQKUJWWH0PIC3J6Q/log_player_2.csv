"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $9,500. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is good, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to me.  While I'm interested, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's offering $8,500, which is $1,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This signals his serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the value of our product. I am unable to accept $8,500. How about considering $9,000 for now? I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to his desired price, he's not ready to accept it yet. He's still in a good position to continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a good deal, but he's also showing a willingness to compromise.  By offering $8,750, he's essentially splitting the difference between his last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he's serious about closing the deal, but he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest. I appreciate your flexibility. I propose we set the product price at $8,900. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is only $250 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a reasonable compromise, and Bob is likely to accept it to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer again.  It's also important to remember that Bob has limited rounds left, and buying from John for $10,000 is always an option, making this a good time to accept and finalize the deal."
