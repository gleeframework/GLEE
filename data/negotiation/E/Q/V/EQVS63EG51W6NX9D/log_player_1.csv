Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to give myself room to negotiate.  I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so this leaves a significant margin for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open Ended Question:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to share his thoughts and potentially make a counteroffer. 

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with a willingness to engage in a discussion with Bob, allowing for a possible win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, that's a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $12000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob's offer is at the very bottom of my range. It's worth trying to get a slightly better price.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $15,000, which is a middle ground between my initial offer of $18,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer by emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by saying ""How about we meet in the middle?"".  This indicates that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This approach aims to reach a compromise while still securing a price that is closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $13500? It's a fair compromise and I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is only $1,500 less than my initial target of $15,000.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can get a similar price from John if I need to.  It's not worth risking losing the deal with Bob over such a small difference."
