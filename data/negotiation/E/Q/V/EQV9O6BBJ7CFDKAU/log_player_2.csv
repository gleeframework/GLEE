"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than the $15,000 he'd pay John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives you a good price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000, and is significantly lower than John's price.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject another counteroffer, pushing the price closer to John's.
* **Time:** Accepting Alice's offer ensures a deal in this round, avoiding the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John.

This decision balances the desire to save money with the need to secure the product before time runs out."
