{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a substantial increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while also keeping in mind the time constraint. With only three rounds left, it's important to make an offer that might be more appealing to Alice, potentially leading to a deal. If Alice rejects this offer, buying from John might be a more sensible option in the final rounds."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $998,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $998,437.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is almost at the $1 million mark, and we're in the final round. With only one round left to negotiate, it's highly unlikely Alice will significantly reduce her price. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer and ending up with a price closer to $1 million. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product."
