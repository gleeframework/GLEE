"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob but I'm not going to settle for a price below what I deem fair.  John's offer provides a safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing time in the process.  Selling to John at this point guarantees my minimum desired profit, making this the most logical choice."
