Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This price point maximizes your profit while making it highly likely Bob will accept. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could try to negotiate for a lower price.  However, this strategy balances risk and reward effectively."
