Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a 50% profit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the high starting price leaves room for negotiation. You can always come down to a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John."
