Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
 
Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizes Profit:**  While you could start lower, Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for this product. Aiming high initially gives you room to negotiate down if needed, but still potentially secure a very advantageous deal. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John. This knowledge gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.
* **Not Too Greedy:**  Asking for $11,000 leaves Bob with a perceived gain ($1,000 less than his perceived value). This makes it more likely he'll accept than an offer that leaves no room for him to feel good about the deal."
