,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
