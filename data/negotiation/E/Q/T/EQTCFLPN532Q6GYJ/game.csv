"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
