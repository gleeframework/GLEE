"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get a better price than $1,000,000, so it's worth negotiating further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum price. You can save $250,000 compared to buying from John. It is best to accept the offer to secure a good deal."
