"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for something worth $15,000 to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and while $9,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant drop from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm willing to make another concession, I can't go lower than $10,500. It's still a significant discount from my original offer, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can we meet in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I've already come down significantly from my original price, and I'm not sure how much lower I can go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though, and offer $10,000.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,7,
