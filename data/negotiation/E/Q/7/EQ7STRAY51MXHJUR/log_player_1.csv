Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is set at $800000. I believe this is a fair price given the market conditions and the potential benefits to my business. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply not a viable option for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,200,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. This price reflects a compromise between our positions and I believe it would be beneficial for both parties involved.

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to find common ground here.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

This is a great deal for me!  I'm happy to sell the product to Bob for $1,000,000.  It meets my minimum value, and I've managed to reach a deal without having to sell to John."
