I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in a deal,  $900,000 is too low for me. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before I consider selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is just too low for me.

Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $950,000? That's the highest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $950,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I don't want to rush into selling to John just yet, as I believe there's still potential for a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about we go with $975,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, and that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to a deal, I'm still not comfortable with $960,000. I'm going to try and get a bit closer to my desired price in the next round. I'll also keep John's offer in mind, as a safety net, but I'm hopeful that I can still reach a good deal with Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, we're running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out on a higher price.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is much closer to my desired price, and it's a safer option at this point."
