{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This price is still within her range of profitability ($1,500,000 worth to her) and gives us room to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still only $20,000 away from John's offer. There's still a chance that I can get a better price from Alice, so I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my ideal price, but it's still $10,000 more than what John is offering. I've already made my final counteroffer, and Alice is not willing to go lower.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the best possible price, I'll buy the product from John."
