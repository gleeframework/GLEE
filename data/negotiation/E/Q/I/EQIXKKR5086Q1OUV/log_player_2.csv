# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

You are trying to save money and $115 is still higher than your maximum budget of $120.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?

$110 is within your budget and a good compromise.  You are saving $10 compared to buying from John."
