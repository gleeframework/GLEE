"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate and see if we can get a price closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for us to negotiate upwards if needed.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but her offer is still above our outside option with John. We'll counter-offer and see if she's willing to move closer to our price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product."",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```

We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($8,500) and our previous counter ($6,000). This shows we're willing to negotiate but also holding firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,250, but I still need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $8,000?  That's my absolute minimum, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's try to close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our walkaway price.  There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since we'll be paying the same amount."
