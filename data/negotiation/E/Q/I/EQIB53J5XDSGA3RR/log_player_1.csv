"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $6,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from him or John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8,500 for this.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,250 is better than his previous offer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $8,000. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise in the next round.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $10,000 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $7,250, but I still need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about $8,000?  That's my absolute minimum, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's try to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
