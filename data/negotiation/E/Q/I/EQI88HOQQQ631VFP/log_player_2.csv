Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $825,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $795,000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $780,000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $790,000? It's a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower and we're already below John's price. It's best to secure the deal at $790,000."
