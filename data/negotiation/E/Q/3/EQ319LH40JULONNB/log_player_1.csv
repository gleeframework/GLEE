{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm starting the price at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer strikes a balance:

* **It's not too low:**  $150 is above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too high:** It allows for a potential discount, making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's engaging:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to participate in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is your minimum, it's always better to try and get more, especially since Bob clearly sees value in the product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show that you're serious about the product's value.**  
* **Potentially get a higher price.**  By counteroffering, you'll see if Bob is truly willing to pay more. 

Let's see if we can get closer to our desired price!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good move:

* **It's not too far off Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're protecting your profit margin.
* **It's encouraging:** The message is friendly and reinforces that you want to reach an agreement.

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Profit:** $110 is a good profit for you, especially since it's only $10 less than your last counteroffer.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out, and you might end up with a lower price or no deal at all.
* **Sure thing:** You're guaranteed to get a sale, which is important for your bottom line.

While you might want to try and squeeze out a few more dollars, accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
