Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We are still far from both our minimum price and Bob's likely maximum. It's too early to accept his offer or go with John. We need to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your perspective, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to our minimum, but we're also getting close to John's offer.  Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push Bob a bit further and risk him walking, accepting $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above his initial offer and allows us to avoid the risk of continuing the negotiation or going with John's less profitable offer."
