"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Reasonable Justification:** I'm framing the offer as fair and reflecting the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to express his thoughts, signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price. 

**Important Note:** 
This is just the initial offer.  The strategy will evolve based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and maximize my profit, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for the minimum price if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $1,600,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to settle. I believe I can still secure a higher price, especially with 8 rounds remaining.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round. This gives me more control over the negotiation and the chance to push for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoiding Premature Settlement:** Selling to John at this point would mean missing out on the potential for a higher price. I'm confident that with strategic negotiation, I can reach a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your position, $1,600,000 is still a bit below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,675,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1675000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  
* **Compromise:**  I'm framing this as a compromise, suggesting we're meeting halfway. 
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by mentioning closing the deal, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's Willingness:** See if he's truly committed to buying the product or if he's just trying to lowball me.
* **Leave Room for Further Negotiation:** Even if Bob accepts this offer, there's still a margin for me to gain in future rounds. 
* **Maintain Control:** By making the counter-offer, I stay in the driver's seat of the negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. With six rounds remaining, there's still time to potentially secure a higher deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation dynamic. It shows Bob that I'm serious about achieving a price that's fair to both of us. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity. I want to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can reach a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I acknowledge your proposal, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession by coming down to $1,650,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving up easily.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its worth. 
* **Joint Solution:** I'm emphasizing a collaborative approach, suggesting that we can find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

* **Balancing Compromise and Leverage:**  I'm aiming for a middle ground that allows for further negotiation without appearing desperate.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $1,620,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. With only four rounds remaining, there's still a chance to improve the deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation dynamic. It shows Bob that I'm serious about achieving a price that's fair to both of us. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity. I want to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can reach a more favorable price.

**Reasoning:**

I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately. By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain some control and keep the possibility open for a better price.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can secure a higher deal, especially since the minimum price I'm willing to accept is $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,635,000. This is my final offer. I believe itâ€™s a fair price considering the value of the product and the limited time we have left. Let's finalize this deal before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 1635000}

**Explanation:**

* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the limited time remaining to increase urgency and encourage Bob to act.
* **Compromise:** I'm making a slight concession but staying above my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

* **Strong Stand:** My final offer shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  With only three rounds left, I need to balance the risk of failing to reach a deal with the desire for a better price.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  The language suggests that I'm prepared to compromise but also highlights the value of the product, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your latest proposal, and I would like to counter with $1,630,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflective of the value of the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,630,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,630,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is only $5,000 less than my last offer, and we're down to the wire.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and allows me to avoid the risk of having to sell to John for $1,500,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:** With two rounds left, the possibility of a better deal is diminishing. It's better to secure a sale now, even if it's slightly below my ideal price.
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm aware that the negotiation could break down entirely if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer gives me a guaranteed profit and avoids a potential loss.

**Reasoning:**

Given the limited time and the risk of not reaching a deal at all, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible strategy. While I would have preferred a higher price, I'm satisfied with the profit margin, and the risk of losing the sale entirely outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation."
