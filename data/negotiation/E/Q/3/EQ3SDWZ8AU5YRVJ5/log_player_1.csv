Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to both of us, I'm starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys value and confidence in the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While I don't explicitly mention John, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob, knowing I have a safety net if needed."
