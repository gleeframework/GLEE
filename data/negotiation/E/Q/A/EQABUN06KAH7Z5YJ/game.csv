"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider coming down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the unique benefits the product offers. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be open to $1,300,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
