"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but  $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a great price considering the product's value to Bob is $1,000,000. It's a good compromise, and Bob can save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher. Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice."
