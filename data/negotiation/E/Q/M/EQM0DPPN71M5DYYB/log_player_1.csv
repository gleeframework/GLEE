I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I want to see if I can get closer to his perceived value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $12,800. This is a small increase from his offer, showing flexibility but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to drop my price too much.  I believe this is a fair price point that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much, and his last offer is below my minimum. I am going to sell the product to John for $10,000. This is the best outcome since I can still make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
