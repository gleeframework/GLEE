"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial valuation of the product might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a higher offer from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to offer $11,000 this time.  I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but I'm also trying to push Bob closer to my desired price point.  If he's serious about buying, I think he'll come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up just a bit more. I'm still also aware that I can sell to John for $10,000, which is a good safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500 now. This is a significant compromise and only $500 more than my minimum. If Bob is serious about buying, I think he'll agree to this price. I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob and I don't think I can get him any higher.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
