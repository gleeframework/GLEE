I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my floor price, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my floor price and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds. I also don't want to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
