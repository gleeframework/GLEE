"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,350,000, which is a $50,000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
