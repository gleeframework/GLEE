"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we set the product price at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is still below my desired price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still provides you with a valuable investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. I'm glad you've made a compromise, but I'm still not able to reach that price point. I'd like to propose $1,000,000 as a final offer. It's close to your valuation of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
