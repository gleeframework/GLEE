Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll try to push Bob a little higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to my minimum value of $9,000.  While I'd love to get closer to $9,250, I'm not sure if I'll be able to push Bob further. It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a deal with John."
