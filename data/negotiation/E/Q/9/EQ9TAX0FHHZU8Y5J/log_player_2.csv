The product is worth $10,000 to you. You can get it from John for that price, so there is no reason to accept Alice's offer of $12,000.  Reject and make a counteroffer to Alice."

I'm offering $9,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I can get it from John for $10,000."

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what you are willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  You can still get the product for a lower price."

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. It's a compromise, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still within my budget and a better deal than John's offer."

Alice is still offering a price higher than John's offer. There is no reason to accept Alice's offer, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Since Alice's offer is very close to John's, I'll offer Alice $10,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay.  If she rejects, I'll go with John."
