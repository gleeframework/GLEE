Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is only $10 lower than my initial offer and still above my minimum price. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential delays, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150 if things go south."
