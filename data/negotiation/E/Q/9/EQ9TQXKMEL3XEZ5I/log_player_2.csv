"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I believe it represents a fair value considering its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $13,000, and he knows the product is worth less to Alice than that. By rejecting the offer, he can start negotiating and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still hoping to get the product for closer to his target price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
