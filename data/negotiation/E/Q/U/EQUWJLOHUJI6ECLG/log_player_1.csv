Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a great deal and would be happy to part with it for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** An initial offer of $18,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle and still getting me a price significantly higher than $10,000. 
* **Confident tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to entice Bob while not revealing my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to get the best possible deal while acknowledging the fallback option of selling to John."
