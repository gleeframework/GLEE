"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'd like to make a new offer of $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's close the deal, I'm confident you won't regret it.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'd like to go back to a price I offered earlier, which is $9,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
