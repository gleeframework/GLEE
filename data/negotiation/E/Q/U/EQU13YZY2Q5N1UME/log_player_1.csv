"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I can do better.  I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob, or at least hold out for John's $10,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'd like to make a new offer of $9,000. I think this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While he's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get more.  It's likely that if I reject his offer, he'll come up a bit in the next round.  I'll hold out for a better offer or accept John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on. Let's close the deal, I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'd like to go back to a price I offered earlier, which is $9,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we're not getting any closer to a deal that satisfies me.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a low offer.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal for me."
