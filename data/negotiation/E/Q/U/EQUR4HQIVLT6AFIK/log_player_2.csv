"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can then counteroffer at a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm sure it will be worth just as much to you. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $12,500 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You can still potentially negotiate a lower price, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering is the best course of action."
