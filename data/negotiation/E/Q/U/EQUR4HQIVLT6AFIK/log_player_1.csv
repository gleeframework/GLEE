{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth it for you considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room for negotiation, and it also shows that I am confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $13,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be happy to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to compromise my minimum value. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm sure it will be worth just as much to you. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that I can get a higher offer from him or John. It's time to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
