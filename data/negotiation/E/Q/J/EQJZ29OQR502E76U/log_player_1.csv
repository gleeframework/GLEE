Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can then assess if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I should just go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer. I'm not willing to sell for that price. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider my revised offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  It's not worth continuing to haggle when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price for the product."
