While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum desired price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Bob is unwilling to budge from his price. I've reached my limit for negotiation, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option at this point."
