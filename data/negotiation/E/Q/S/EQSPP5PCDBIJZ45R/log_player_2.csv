"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate or head over to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good idea to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your actual budget. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $80, there's a chance Alice will counter, potentially settling on a price well below your $100 maximum. 
* **Considering Alternatives:** Remember, you always have John as a backup option at $100. This knowledge empowers you to walk away if Alice's counteroffers remain unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still over your budget. You have some bargaining power, as you know you can get the product for $100 from John. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it."", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You're increasing your offer, but staying well below your $100 limit and Alice's previous offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating you're ""ready to buy,"" you signal that this is a serious offer and you're motivated to close the deal.
* **Pressure on Alice:** Alice is now aware that you have alternative options (even if she doesn't know the exact price John offers). This puts a bit of pressure on her to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I can offer it to you for $130, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her price, and while she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach your $100 limit. You've negotiated well, but it's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
