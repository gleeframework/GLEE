Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, Alice. How about we try $12,000? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is now offering his maximum valuation, it's still below our minimum ($15,000). There's no guarantee further negotiation will close that gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees we get our minimum acceptable price."
