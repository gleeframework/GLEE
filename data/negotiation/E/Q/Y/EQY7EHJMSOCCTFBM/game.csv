"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $850,000. Can we meet at this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
