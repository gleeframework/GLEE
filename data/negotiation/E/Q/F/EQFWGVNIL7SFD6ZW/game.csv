"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, considering it's worth $100 to me. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $108. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a buyer who values the product as much as you do.",105.0,Bob,6,
