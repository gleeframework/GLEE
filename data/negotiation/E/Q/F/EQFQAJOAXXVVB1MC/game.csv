"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can reach a more equitable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for your product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I need to recoup a bit more of my investment. Would you be willing to go to $11,000? This is a fair compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
