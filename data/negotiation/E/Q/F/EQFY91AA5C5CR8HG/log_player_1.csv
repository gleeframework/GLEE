Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that it's a ""great deal."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still a profitable sale and avoids further negotiation.  It's best to take the sure thing."
