{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $905,000 is very strong. Accepting this offer provides a significant profit and avoids:

* **Risk of further negotiation:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. Pushing further might lead him to walk away. 
* **Time cost:**  Continuing negotiations delays the sale and the opportunity to deploy the capital from the sale.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at this point represents the best combination of maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
