"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I can't accept a price that undervalues the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still offers you a significant return on investment while allowing me to fairly value the product.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current budget, I am unable to agree to a price higher than $1,000,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
