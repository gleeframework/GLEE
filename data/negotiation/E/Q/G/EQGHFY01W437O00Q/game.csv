"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand your budget, but this product is truly unique and its value is in line with my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $775,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
