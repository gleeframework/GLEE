"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  How does that sound?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $130 is still below what I need. Let's split the difference - how about $135? I'm confident you'll find this product valuable, and I'm trying to be flexible.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $135. How about we try $132? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",132.0,Bob,6,
