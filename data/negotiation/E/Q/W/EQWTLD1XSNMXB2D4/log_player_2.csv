"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $100 for it?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110 for the product. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $110 is less than Bob's maximum of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, it's possible Alice won't budge further. There's a risk of losing the deal completely.
* **Time constraint:** With 10 rounds, it's better to lock in a reasonable price now rather than risk going through more rounds and possibly ending up buying from John.

**Overall:** Accepting the offer of $110 is the best option at this point, considering Bob's budget, the potential for further negotiation, and the time constraint."
