"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my initial offer. How about $150?  This would give us both a good deal.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my initial offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $130 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go down to $140.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $135? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my last offer.",135.0,Bob,6,
