"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,350,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a compromise that still reflects its value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
