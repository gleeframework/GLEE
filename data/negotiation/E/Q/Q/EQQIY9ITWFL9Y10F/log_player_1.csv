"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to trigger a negotiation where he reveals his willingness to pay.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counter-offer.  However, I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I believe I can push for a better price, especially since Bob's initial offer suggests he's willing to pay a significant amount.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target in the next few rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying within my desired profit range. By meeting him halfway, I'm hoping to encourage a quick agreement and avoid further rounds of negotiation.  If he rejects, I'm ready to adjust my offer again in the next round."
