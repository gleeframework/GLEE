Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to do $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than $100, I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  This would still give you a great deal on a product you value at $150."", ""product_price"": 120}
