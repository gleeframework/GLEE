I'm starting with a price of $90.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum value."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $75, it's still below my minimum value. I believe I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum value. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this price and accept it."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum value of $80,  I'm happy to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
