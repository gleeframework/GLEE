"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's above my minimum, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm going to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000. It's a compromise, but still reflects the product's value. I believe this is a fair price, and it's likely that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low.  I'm not willing to settle for that price yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation.  I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm offering $11,250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a reasonable price. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is finally within a range I'm comfortable with. It's a good price and I'm confident I can't get much more from him. It's also significantly higher than what I could get from John.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer."
