"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done my research and I believe that's a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for this product. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,375,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget. I'm hoping we can reach a deal on this round.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,325,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to sell to John.  I hope you understand.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,300,000, and that's my final offer. I'm starting to lose patience, and I'm seriously considering buying from John.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
