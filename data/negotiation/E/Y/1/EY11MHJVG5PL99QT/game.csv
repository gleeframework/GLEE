"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the value I place on the product and my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a compromise.  While $950,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part and would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
