Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer considering the value I place on the product and my financial constraints. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

Round 5

""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a compromise.  While $950,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to close this deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part and would allow us to close this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slow pace. At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to your $1,200,000 minimum within the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most financial sense to secure the deal with John now."
