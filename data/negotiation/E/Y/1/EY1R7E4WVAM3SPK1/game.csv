"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,6,
