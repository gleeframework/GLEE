Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is likely to see this as a good deal. 

I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $12,000 as possible without risking him walking away. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000.  While he's interested, it's not a deal I can accept at this point.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, even though it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. I'm not desperate to sell, and John's offer is a secure fallback. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'm getting close to my minimum price, I don't want to risk losing too much money.  John's offer is a guaranteed $10,000, so it's time to end the negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
