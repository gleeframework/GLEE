This offer is exclusive to you and aims to ensure you experience the full potential of our product without any compromise on quality or value. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
