"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration of its value, I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than even my minimum acceptable value. This achieves two things:
    * **Anchoring:** It sets a high reference point in Bob's mind. Even though it's unrealistic, it makes subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
    * **Room to Negotiate:** It provides ample space for me to make concessions and still reach a favorable outcome.

* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This initial offer is primarily to gauge Bob's reaction and understand how aggressive he might be in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below his own valuation of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates room for negotiation. While accepting the offer would close the deal, it would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially knowing I have the fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** I make a large concession to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a more agreeable price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This keeps the door open for further negotiation while ensuring that, even if accepted, I still gain a substantial profit.
* **Maintain Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price point. I aim to steer Bob away from his low anchor and towards a more realistic valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Threshold:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but $1,350,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Leverage Remaining:** I have time and options on my side. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can either get Bob closer to my target or confidently sell to John without leaving too much money on the table. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** Rejecting this offer will signal that I'm serious about the value of the product and not willing to settle for a low price. It will be interesting to see how much Bob is willing to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $1,600,000?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and maintain a positive atmosphere, even though I'm rejecting his offer.  
* **Smaller Concession:** I make a smaller adjustment this round, signaling that I'm nearing my bottom line. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum, yet potentially attractive enough to Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000. My hope is to close the deal in this round or the next."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement. However, there's still a gap between your offer and what I can realistically agree to. To make this work, I can offer $1,400,000. This demonstrates my seriousness, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for more, the difference is no longer substantial enough to risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Bob's Commitment:**  His message indicates he's serious about closing the deal and has likely stretched his budget as far as he's comfortable.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation out further could result in diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a very good price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
