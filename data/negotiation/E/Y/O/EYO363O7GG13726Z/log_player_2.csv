"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration of its value, I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's significantly more than John's offer and far above my budget. I'll counter-offer with a much lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable price. Would you consider $1,000,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $1,750,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $1,750,000 is still too high. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can negotiate her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a significant amount over my ideal price and what John is offering. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I need to see some substantial movement from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement. However, there's still a gap between your offer and what I can realistically agree to. To make this work, I can offer $1,400,000. This demonstrates my seriousness, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget."",
