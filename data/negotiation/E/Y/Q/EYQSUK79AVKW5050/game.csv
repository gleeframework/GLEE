"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while also giving you a great deal on a valuable product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While that price is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch above my budget.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. This price still allows you to get a great deal on a product worth significantly more, while ensuring I can achieve a reasonable profit.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
