Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's above Bob's valuation but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for both of us to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $9000?  It's a good price for you, and still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to recoup some of my costs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9200.  It's a good price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $9,200 is still too low for me, and I don't want to continue negotiating further.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk a lower price with Bob."
