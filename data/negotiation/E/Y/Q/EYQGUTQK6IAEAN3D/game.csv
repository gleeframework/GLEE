"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for my budget, but I'm definitely interested in the product. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Alice,5,
