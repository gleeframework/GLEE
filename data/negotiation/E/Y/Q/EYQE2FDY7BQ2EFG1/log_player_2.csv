"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's room for both parties to find a price that works for them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While Alice has come down, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  He has room to negotiate further and hopefully secure a price closer to his target of $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Let's try $10,750.  It's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $10,900. It's a small concession, but it shows my willingness to work towards a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $200 above Bob's last counteroffer of $10,750. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Good deal:** While not ideal, $10,900 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than John's price and closer to his target."
