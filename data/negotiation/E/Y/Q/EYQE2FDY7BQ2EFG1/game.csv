"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Let's try $10,750.  It's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $10,900. It's a small concession, but it shows my willingness to work towards a deal. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
