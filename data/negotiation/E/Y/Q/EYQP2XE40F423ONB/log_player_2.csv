**Reasoning:** 

Alice has circled back to her previous offer of $700,000 and is unwilling to budge further. This indicates she's unlikely to go significantly lower.  Since I can get the product for $800,000 from John, it's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice.  She might not come down enough, and I'd lose the opportunity to buy from John."
