Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is above Bob's valuation of $8,000 but allows for some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting the value Bob will get. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to my minimum value ($10,000) while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum valuation of $10,000, and even below my initial offer of $9,500. 
* **I need to keep negotiating.** I'm not willing to accept such a low price, and I believe there's still room for a better offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This still leaves a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $8,800. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer of $9,500. It's still a profitable deal for me, and I believe it's a fair price for a product Bob clearly values.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the value Bob will receive. I'm using language that suggests finding a compromise and reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my target price while still being reasonable for Bob.  I'm confident that Bob will be more likely to accept this offer than my previous one, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
