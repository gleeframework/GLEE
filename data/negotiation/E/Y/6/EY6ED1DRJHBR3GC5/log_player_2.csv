"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$120 is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $120 is much closer to the $150 price from John than Bob's ideal price range. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  Offering $100 is a significant drop and shows Bob's seriousness in negotiating, while still leaving room for compromise. This price is also significantly lower than John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still higher than what he's aiming for. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price, especially since he has several rounds left and the alternative is to buy from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price. By offering $110, he's showing Alice that he's serious about finding a middle ground. This offer is still significantly lower than John's price, making it a better deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although $135 is a slight improvement from Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price range.  Bob has several rounds left and the alternative is buying from John for $150, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now approaching the middle ground.  He's gradually increased his offer, showing Alice he's willing to compromise. This offer is still lower than Alice's latest price but indicates a willingness to negotiate.  Bob has 4 more rounds to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is getting closer to John's price, it's still too high for Bob. He has 3 rounds remaining and a potential counteroffer to send. The goal is to get as close to his ideal price range as possible before resorting to buying from John. By rejecting, Bob can continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now taking a bolder step in negotiation. While Alice's last offer was only $10 lower than John's price, Bob is offering a price that is within $25 of his ideal price range. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and willing to compromise. With only 2 rounds remaining, it's a risky move but may be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice. While $145 is closer to Bob's ideal price range, it's still higher than he's aiming for. He's also already rejected Alice's previous offer, and there's a strong chance she won't accept his next counteroffer.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $150, ensuring he gets the product while minimizing the risk of the negotiation failing completely."
