"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $120 to Bob and $80 to Alice.  Alice's offer of $90 leaves some room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $87.5 is less than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($120). 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:** While Bob could try to negotiate a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Negotiating further will take time, and Bob might miss out on other opportunities.  

Accepting the offer is the most logical choice for Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price without risking the deal."
