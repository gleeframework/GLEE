"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. I'm eager to work out a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a substantial discount and reflects my desire to find a deal that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still beyond what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
