"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $1,300,000 for this product.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll be getting from the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
