"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I can consider. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 is more reflective of that. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us, so let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I understand the value you place on this product, $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer, but we're not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the significant value this product holds while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both within our respective price ranges.  Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
