"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** The initial price of $1,300,000 sets a high anchor. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it influences his perception of what's reasonable.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, assuring Bob that the initial price isn't final."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, you have plenty of room to negotiate and a guaranteed offer from John. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly lower than what I can consider. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,150,000 is more reflective of that. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** You're reducing your price by $150,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a strong position.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, justifying the higher price point.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** You're emphasizing a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I understand the value you place on this product, $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated to buy. You are still in a position to negotiate further, as you have a comfortable buffer between his current offer and John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is getting closer, but we're not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the significant value this product holds while acknowledging your budget concerns."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're reducing your price by another $100,000, showing flexibility but at a slower pace than Bob's increases.
* **Framing as a Compromise:**  By suggesting you ""meet in the middle,"" you frame this price as a fair solution for both parties.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** You're still well above Bob's initial offer and above your guaranteed sale price with John, allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that keeps us both within our respective price ranges.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to your $1,000,000 minimum, his increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer within the remaining rounds. Selling to John now guarantees you the best possible outcome without further negotiation risk."
