Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects, I can always go with John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a higher price than Bob's offer. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer of $1,700,000 to avoid further negotiations. It's a good deal considering my minimum value for the product and the risk of Bob backing out completely."
