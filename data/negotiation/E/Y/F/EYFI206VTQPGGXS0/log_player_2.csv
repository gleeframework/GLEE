Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $10,500, which is within your budget and a good deal considering you're only paying $500 more than Alice's desired price.  It's a good point to accept the offer."
