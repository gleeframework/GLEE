"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $75 is lower than my minimum price of $80, I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $75 but still lower than my minimum price.
