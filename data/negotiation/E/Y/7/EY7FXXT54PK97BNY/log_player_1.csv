"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  To move this forward, I could consider $875,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $875,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation with Bob, as there's a risk he might lower his offer or we might miss out on selling altogether. Accepting the $800,000 ensures a sale at our minimum acceptable price."
