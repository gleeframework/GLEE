Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I subtly mention the product's potential value to Bob (""perfect for you"").

This strategy aims to:

* Get a good starting point without immediately alienating Bob.
* Leave room to potentially negotiate down if needed.
*  Keep the option of selling to John open if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Leverage:** While $105 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value ($100).  I want to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, so I have leverage to negotiate further.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob will walk away, but the potential reward of getting closer to $115 outweighs the risk of selling to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for a product worth so much to you!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. This shows willingness to negotiate and avoids the risk of a stalemate.
* **Reframing Value:** I'm again highlighting the value to Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable. 

This counteroffer balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a little too high for me.  How about $108?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $108 is very close to my minimum acceptable value ($100).
* **Closing the Deal:**  Bob's message indicates he's ready to finalize the deal.  Risking another counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or him walking away.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a worse outcome or a lost sale. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale close to my target and minimizes the risk of a negative outcome."
