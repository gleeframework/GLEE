# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?

You can do better than $115.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great deal for a product worth so much to you!
