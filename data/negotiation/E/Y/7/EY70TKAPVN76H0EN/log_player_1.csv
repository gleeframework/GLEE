I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is still higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him room to potentially negotiate, but it also allows me to make a decent profit. 

I'm strategically leaving some room for negotiation as it is beneficial to keep Bob engaged. At the same time, I want to ensure that the final price is closer to my desired value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a higher offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise between his offer and my initial price. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob, as it still offers him a good deal while getting me closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, his offer of $10,200 is getting too close to my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not confident that I can push him higher, and the risk of continued negotiation is not worth the potential loss. It's better to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
