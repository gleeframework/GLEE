"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the unique advantages and potential this product holds, which I'm confident you'll recognize.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has unique advantages, but I'm not convinced it's worth the premium you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's cut to the chase.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, reflecting my desire to see this valuable product in your capable hands.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, as I mentioned earlier, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. I'm eager to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
