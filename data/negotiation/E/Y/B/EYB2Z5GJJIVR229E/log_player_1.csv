Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it at $16,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) and your minimum ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** The message hints at broader value (""incredibly valuable to you"") without explicitly revealing the other offer from John.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning a public listing, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially motivating him to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be wiser."
