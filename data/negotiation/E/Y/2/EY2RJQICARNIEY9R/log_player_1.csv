Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115?  It's still a great price, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
