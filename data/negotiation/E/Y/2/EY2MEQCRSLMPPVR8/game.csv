"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to show you I'm serious about making a deal.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 still doesn't meet my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This is a small gap to bridge, and I believe we can close the deal.  Let me know if you're on board.",13250.0,Alice,5,
