"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offering process and potentially reach a price closer to his $12,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to show you I'm serious about making a deal.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget.  He has a few more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price, especially since Alice already demonstrated a willingness to compromise.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for further exploration of a price closer to Bob's goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 still doesn't meet my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $13,250. This is a small gap to bridge, and I believe we can close the deal.  Let me know if you're on board. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While there are a few rounds left, the negotiation seems to be nearing a stalemate. Bob has already made a significant counteroffer, and Alice has only slightly lowered her price. It's likely that further rounds will result in small price adjustments, and Bob may not be able to achieve his desired price. 

By choosing to buy from John, Bob can secure the product for his target price and avoid potentially further rounds of unproductive negotiations."
