"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
