{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $15,000, leaving you room to accept a counteroffer or walk away to John. 

By starting at $12,000, you are setting the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  While I want to make a deal, accepting $9,000 would leave me with a substantial loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves me some room, but shows I'm serious about making a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm glad to see you're willing to negotiate. I'm still looking to stay within my budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's still less than what I initially hoped for,  it's a good compromise considering his budget constraints. I'm willing to accept his offer to close the deal."
