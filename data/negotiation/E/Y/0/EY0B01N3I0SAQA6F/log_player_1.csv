Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $8,000 is far too low for me, and I think I can get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate something closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,000 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round, but if things don't work out, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this - let's go with $9,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9750 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9200. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  While I'm close to my desired price, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more back and forth with no guarantee of a higher offer. It's better to secure a sale with John for $12,000, which is a fair price and will give me the financial security I need."
