"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $1,100,000?  This gives you a considerable savings compared to the true value of the product, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair deal considering my budget limitations."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we meet at $900,000? This represents a significant discount from the true value of the product and should be within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000. While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a little further, John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice when you have a better deal readily available."
