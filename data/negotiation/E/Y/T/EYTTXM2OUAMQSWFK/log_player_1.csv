{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $120. Are you interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay. I'm also framing it as an ""at least"" value to give him the impression that I'm flexible on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'd rather try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm trying to keep my budget tight. How about we settle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is slightly higher than John's offer. While it is still less than my ideal price, I am willing to accept it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and the potential of ending up with John's offer."
