Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $120 allows room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to get a better price than $80.
* **Potential Value:** The message highlights that the product could be valuable to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject a higher offer. However, given the information, aiming higher initially offers a better chance of maximizing your profit."
