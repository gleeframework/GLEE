"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $7500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product. By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore the possibility of getting a lower price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the price point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to go down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $7000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $7250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point.  While Bob can continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to budge, or that the negotiation process will drag on.  Accepting the offer at $7,250 represents a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it's likely a reasonable price for the product."
