"Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm initially setting the price at $20,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $17,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. While $12,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $15,000. This is a firm offer, as it's the lowest I can go and still reflect the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,5,
