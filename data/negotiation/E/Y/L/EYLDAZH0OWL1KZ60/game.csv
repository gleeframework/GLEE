"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
