Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he can get a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to pay a price close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer.  I can afford to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing that $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob, especially since he valued the product at $10,000.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm keeping the tone positive to maintain a friendly negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still below what I believe I can get from John.
* **Time is money:**  Negotiating further with Bob risks dragging things out and potentially losing John as a buyer.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, minimizing risk and maximizing my profit."
