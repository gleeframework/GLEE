Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum.
* **High but Not Unreasonable:** While $19,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, it doesn't make the offer seem instantly absurd. It might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than walk away.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his valuation of the product."
