"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  I'm confident that this product can deliver substantial value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
