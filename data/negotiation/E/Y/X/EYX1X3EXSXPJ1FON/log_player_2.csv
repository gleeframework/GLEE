"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, there's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  I'm confident that this product can deliver substantial value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is now within Bob's budget:**  $1,100,000 is below Bob's maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation could be risky:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and Bob could end up paying more to John if he rejects this offer.
* **A reasonable compromise:** $1,100,000 represents a good compromise, splitting the difference between Alice's previous offer and Bob's counteroffer."
