"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  You can try to counter-offer and see if you can get it closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $130? I think that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum price, giving her an incentive to accept.  This also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down slightly, which is good. However, $135 is still more than your ideal price. There's still room to negotiate further, and it's worth exploring a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to split the difference, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $132. It's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still pushing for a lower price.  $132 is a small step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It also positions you closer to your ideal price point, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
