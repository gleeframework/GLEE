Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. Let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product for $15,000. This is your ""safety net"".
* **Aiming high, but reasonably:** Starting at Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) is too low.  Offering it slightly below your ""safety net"" ($15,000) leaves potential money on the table. Aiming for a price significantly higher than $15,000 creates a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $19,000 price tag gives Bob the impression of a discount if he negotiates down, even if it's still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving you the security of John's offer."
