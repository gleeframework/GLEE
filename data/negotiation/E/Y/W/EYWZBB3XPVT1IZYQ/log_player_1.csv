I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my target with a counteroffer."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  John is a sure thing, and I'll get a guaranteed $80."
