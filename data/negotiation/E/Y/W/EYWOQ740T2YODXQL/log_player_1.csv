Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will be telling. If he outright rejects it, we know we might need to go lower. If he counters, it means he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Safety Net:** We have John as a backup buyer, ensuring we won't get stuck with the product. This gives us leverage in the negotiation. 

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. We can always adjust our price based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
