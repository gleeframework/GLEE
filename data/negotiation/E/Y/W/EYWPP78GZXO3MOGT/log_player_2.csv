"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you and I'm willing to let it go for a lower price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You can save $2,000 by negotiating with Alice. You are willing to pay $12,000 and she is willing to accept $8,000, so there's room for a good deal.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $9,500?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. He can save $2,500 compared to buying from John. Even though he could potentially get a slightly lower price through further negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the time spent negotiating might not be worth the potential savings."
