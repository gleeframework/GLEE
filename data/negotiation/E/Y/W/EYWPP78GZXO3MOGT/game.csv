"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $12,000 to you and I'm willing to let it go for a lower price. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about $9,500?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
