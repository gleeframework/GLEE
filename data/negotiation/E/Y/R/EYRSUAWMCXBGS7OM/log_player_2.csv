"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. It allows me to generate a healthy profit while giving you a valuable asset at a price that aligns with your budget. I understand this is a substantial investment, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it provides. Please consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer waiting in the wings, so I won't be able to hold this offer open for long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
