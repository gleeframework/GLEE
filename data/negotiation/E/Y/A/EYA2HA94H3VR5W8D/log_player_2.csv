Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll appreciate its value.  My initial price is $11,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $11,000. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique qualities and value to you, I believe $10,500 is a fair compromise. This still leaves room for you to benefit significantly, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree that it reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
