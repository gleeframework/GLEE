"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique qualities and value to you, I believe $10,500 is a fair compromise. This still leaves room for you to benefit significantly, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree that it reflects the product's value.",10000.0,Bob,4,
