"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great value at a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  A counteroffer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to $950,000. This would represent a significant saving for me while still offering you a respectable profit margin.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for further negotiation, so it's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to get closer to his desired price of $950,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000. This would be a good middle ground for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while giving you a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her previous offers, and it's still within Bob's budget.  While Bob might prefer a lower price, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and he risks losing the product to John if he continues to reject offers.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a reasonable price."
