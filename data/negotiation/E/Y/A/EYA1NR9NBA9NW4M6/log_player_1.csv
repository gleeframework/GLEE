{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a strong one. While it's less than the ideal $1,500,000 from John, continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob is signaling that he's nearing his maximum price, and pushing him further risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting the $1,200,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
