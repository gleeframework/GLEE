"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I place on it, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work behind it. To move forward, I can offer it to you for $1,900,000. This price reflects a substantial adjustment on my end while acknowledging the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I acknowledge your commitment to this negotiation. However, we're still quite far apart in our valuation of the product.  I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This is a firm offer, representing a significant compromise to bridge the gap.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still beyond what I'm able to invest.  To move closer to a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a significant jump in my offer and shows my genuine desire to acquire this product. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen. I'm adjusting my price to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a very strong offer, and if we can agree, we can finalize this deal. But if you need to go lower, I might have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
