"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 falls short of reflecting that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's split the difference - how about $1,250,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you finding middle ground. I'm committed to reaching an agreement that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,275,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
