{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you'll make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for a deal that benefits both of you.
* **It's a friendly approach:**  A positive opening message can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
