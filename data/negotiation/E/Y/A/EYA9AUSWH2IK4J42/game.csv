"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $125?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $125 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. How about we meet in the middle at $117?",117.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. $117 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $121? This would give us both a good deal.",121.0,Alice,5,
