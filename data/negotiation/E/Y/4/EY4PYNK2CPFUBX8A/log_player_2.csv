"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* Alice's offer is still above your maximum price. 
* You know John will sell it to you for $120. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or go directly to John."
