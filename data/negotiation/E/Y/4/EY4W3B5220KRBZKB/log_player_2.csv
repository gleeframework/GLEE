"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's something that I believe will be of great benefit to you, and I'm confident it's worth more than the price I'm asking. Let's discuss a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Bob should reject the offer and explore options to negotiate a lower price with Alice or consider alternative products."
