"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $87.50 is still too low. How about we split the difference and go with $88.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",88.5,Alice,5,

I'm still a bit hesitant at $88.50. I'd be willing to go up to $86.25. Can you meet me at that price?,86.25,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $86.25. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $87.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",87.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not quite comfortable at $87. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $86.25 and $87, which would be $86.625. Can you consider that?",86.625,Bob,8,
