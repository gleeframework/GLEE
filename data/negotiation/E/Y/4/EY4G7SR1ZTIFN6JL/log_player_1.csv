""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn a premium.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product for a price between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and our minimum ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit beyond our guaranteed sale to John."
