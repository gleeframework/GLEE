Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is above his perceived value ($10,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* This gives me a margin for negotiation and still leaves room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal. 
* If he rejects, I can still potentially make a profit by negotiating further or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* While selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. 
*  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price from the previous round to $11,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer of $10,500 but closer to his perceived value.
* This shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still leaving room for further bargaining. 
*  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to my minimum, I've already made several counteroffers and it seems like we're not getting any closer to my desired price. 
* At this point, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John and end the negotiation. 
*  Further negotiation with Bob might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach a deal that meets my minimum requirements."
