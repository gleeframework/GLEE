"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $950,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $1,050,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to get closer to my asking price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of $1,050,000. How about $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
