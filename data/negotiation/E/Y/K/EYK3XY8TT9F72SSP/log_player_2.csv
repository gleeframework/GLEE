Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we are getting closer. To avoid further back and forth, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other interested buyers at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice's price is getting closer to a reasonable point, her final offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it's more advantageous to cut losses and buy from John."
