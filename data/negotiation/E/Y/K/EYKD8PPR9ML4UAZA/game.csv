"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, $1,250,000 is a significant gap from what I consider its true worth. I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet at $1,350,000? This reflects its value and our shared interest in a successful deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000.  This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
