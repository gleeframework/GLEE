Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your confidence in the product's value.  However, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,350,000, I'm still within my comfort zone to negotiate further.  We're close, and I'm confident I can get a price closer to my target."
