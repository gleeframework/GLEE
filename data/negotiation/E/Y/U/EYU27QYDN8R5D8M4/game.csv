"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your confidence in the product's value.  However, $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,300,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial valuation.  Let's compromise at $1,400,000.  I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial and allow us to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1375000.0,Alice,5,
