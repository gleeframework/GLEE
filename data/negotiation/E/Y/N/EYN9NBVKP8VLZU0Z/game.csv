"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,300,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
