"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a substantial profit. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $950,000? This would allow me to secure a reasonable profit while still being within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be able to make a decent profit as well.  How about $1,050,000? This leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've carefully considered your latest offer. While I appreciate the slight reduction, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be open to $1,000,000 for the product? This would allow us to close the gap slightly and move closer to a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This price allows both of us to walk away happy.  I'm not willing to go lower than this. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I propose a final offer of $1,010,000. This price allows us to reach a compromise that respects both our positions. I hope you'll find it acceptable and we can finalize the transaction.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
