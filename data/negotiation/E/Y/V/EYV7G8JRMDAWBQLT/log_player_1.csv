Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable to you. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's unique qualities. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm also not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's a good chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I value your perspective, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Given the product's unique features and potential, I believe a price closer to $900,000 would be more appropriate. Would you be willing to reconsider with an offer closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  While I would prefer to get even closer to my initial asking price, it's a reasonable offer and it's unlikely that I'll be able to get much more from Bob.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation process that might result in a lower price or a sale to John."
