"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  I'm very interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,500 is still slightly out of my price range.  I'm confident that $12,000 would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider that offer. ",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $1,000 for free. This way, you'll get the product and some extra benefits that will make it even more valuable to you. So, the total value you'll get is $13,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
