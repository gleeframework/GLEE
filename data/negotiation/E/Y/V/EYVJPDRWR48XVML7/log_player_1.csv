Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,500 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $12,500 is less than Bob's value of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a fair offer:** It's a good starting point for a negotiation, showing you're willing to compromise.

This strategy allows for further negotiation while still securing a good price. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer and continue the negotiation process.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if you feel the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a tempting offer, I'm looking to get closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,750?  This would still represent a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $11,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer of $11,375 is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. I'm happy with the profit, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal completely."
