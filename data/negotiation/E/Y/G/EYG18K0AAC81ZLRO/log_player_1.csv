Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid $12,500 is still beyond what I'm prepared to spend. Would you consider $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering prices well below your minimum acceptable price. While he is showing some willingness to negotiate, his increments are too small to be promising. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum price.  It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the sure thing with John."
