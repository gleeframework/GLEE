"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000. Would that work for you?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than my minimum.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. How about we settle on $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you consider $14,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
