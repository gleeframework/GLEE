"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $900000.

This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable asset. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
