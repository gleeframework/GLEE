"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,700,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its market value. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe the potential benefits to your business will far outweigh the cost. Please let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth more to Alice than it is to Bob, and Alice is trying to sell it for more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
