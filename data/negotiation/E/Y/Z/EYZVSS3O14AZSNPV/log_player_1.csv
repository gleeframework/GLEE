Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value. I also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get more, $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering Bob's budget.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and keeps me from potentially losing out to John."
