Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate, but also makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly or use John's offer as leverage. But always aim to get the best price possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than the price I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. This gives me a chance to see if I can get a better deal without losing out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows us to both get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
