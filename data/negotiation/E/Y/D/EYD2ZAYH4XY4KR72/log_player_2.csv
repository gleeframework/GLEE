"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer."
