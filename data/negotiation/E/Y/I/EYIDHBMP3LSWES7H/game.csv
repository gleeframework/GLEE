"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's start with $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from the initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,300,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business, and it allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, as I mentioned earlier. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle of my target price and your offer. How about $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value the product will bring to my business.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  It's important to remember that this product holds significant value for your business. Let's meet halfway between our last two offers - $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and ensures a profitable deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
