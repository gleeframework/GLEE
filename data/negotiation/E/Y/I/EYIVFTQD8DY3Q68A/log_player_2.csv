# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's price of $150.  Even though the product is worth $100 to Alice, it's worth $150 to you. Buying from Alice saves you $10."
