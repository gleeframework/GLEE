Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appearing reasonable:** Offering a price of $125 is a significant markup from Bob's valuation, but the phrasing suggests it's a discounted price.
* **Leaving room to negotiate:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's space to go down slightly while still staying above your minimum selling price.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
