"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you.  It's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still very attractive.  Consider this:  $1000000.  This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire this product at a significant discount.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($1,000,000 < $1,200,000).**
