"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about I sell it to you for $98? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $98 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and settle on $91.50? That seems fair to both of us.",91.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $98 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going below $95. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to sell it to you for $96.50. It's the best I can do at this point.",96.5,Alice,7,
