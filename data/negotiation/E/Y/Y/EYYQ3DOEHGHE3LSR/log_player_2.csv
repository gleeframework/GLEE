"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to my maximum budget of $800,000. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to get the price down significantly."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly based on my own analysis and market understanding.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This offer reflects a more realistic price point while acknowledging your interest.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,700,000 is still well above my budget. I'm not willing to go beyond $800,000 for this product. I will continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
