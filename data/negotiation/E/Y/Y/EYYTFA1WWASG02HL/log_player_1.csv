{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount considering its value to me.  I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept a higher price than he initially envisioned.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering a lower price than my minimum, I demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to counter-offer.
* **Time is Money:** By offering a high price, I create urgency for Bob to make a decision before I potentially sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a price you can live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **I can likely get a better price:**  Even though Bob is a potential buyer, his offer is too low. I can try to get a higher price in the next round.
* **John is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price. This is a better strategy than accepting a low offer or selling to John immediately."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from the previous round but still staying above my minimum.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the possibility of selling to John, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with an invitation to continue the conversation, making it clear that I'm open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is a safe option:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is a higher price than Bob's current offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to get a higher price. It's possible that Bob might increase his offer in the next round.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's not yet at a point where I would be willing to accept it. Selling to John is the safest option, but I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Bob."

Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm maintaining my previous offer of $1,350,000, as it's the closest I can get to my minimum while still feeling confident about the deal.
* **Finality:** I'm stating that this is my final concession, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
