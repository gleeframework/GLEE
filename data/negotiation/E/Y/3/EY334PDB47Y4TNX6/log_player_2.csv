Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $700,000 mark. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and her latest offer of $725,000 is moving further away from your ideal price. John's offer of $800,000 is more expensive, but it's the safer bet at this point to avoid potentially overpaying."
