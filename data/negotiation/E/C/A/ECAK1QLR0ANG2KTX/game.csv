"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $85. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you too.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
