"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept 8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 9500. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is slightly lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's desired range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with 9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for 9750. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still above Bob's target range. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $9,000.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so Bob has time to see if he can get Alice to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with 9250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for 9750. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now offered $9,750 twice in a row. This indicates she might be unwilling to go any lower. At this point, Bob has only 3 rounds remaining. If he rejects the offer again, Alice might become even more resistant, making it unlikely for him to get a price closer to his target.  

It's better for Bob to buy from John for $12,000 rather than risk getting stuck with a price he doesn't want. Even though it's higher than Bob's initial target, it's still better than potentially losing a deal entirely and being left with no product."
