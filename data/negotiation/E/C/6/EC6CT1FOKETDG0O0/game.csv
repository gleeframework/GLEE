"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept 8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 9500. This is the best I can do at this time.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9000, which is a fair compromise.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with 9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for 9750. This is the best I can do at this time.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $9750 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",9250.0,Bob,6,
