"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to both of us. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
