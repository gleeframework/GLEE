"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still above the product's worth to you. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. You can start by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. I can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer.  I'm not yet in a position where buying from John at $1,500,000 is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product to both of us. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'll continue to counteroffer and see if I can get her down further.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a less attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price that allows for a good profit for you and fits within my budget. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm flattered that you're willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that this is her final offer.  I'm getting close to my ideal price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. At this point, buying from John at $1,500,000 is a significantly worse outcome, making Alice's offer the best option."
