Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation but is still significantly higher than what I would accept from John.  I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, but if he rejects it, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a slightly higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a lower price, hoping to split the difference."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a slightly lower price of $1,650,000. This is still a fair amount for both of us and I believe it's a price that Bob might be willing to accept, considering he already showed interest by making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my target price and is a better outcome than selling to John for $1,500,000.  I'll accept his offer."
