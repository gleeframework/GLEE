"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You have room to negotiate because you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice wants to sell for at least $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the minimum price I'm willing to pay. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it clearly shows my budget and leaves room for Alice to counter if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my maximum budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, as the price difference is not too significant. It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down further if I persist."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still staying within my budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation."
