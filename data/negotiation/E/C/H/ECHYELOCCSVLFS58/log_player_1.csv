Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than Bob's perceived value but less than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm phrasing the message in a way that invites discussion and negotiation. This makes Bob feel more involved and potentially willing to compromise.
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm keeping John in the back of my mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product at $10,000, Alice. I understand your perspective, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Although Bob's budget is limited, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore if we can find a middle ground.
* **John is a safety net:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. However, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's a chance I can earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can reach a deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that my product has value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By staying above Bob's offer, I maintain the pressure and keep John as a viable alternative.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has been firm on his $8,000 offer, and I've already made a concession. Further negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a significantly better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance I could convince Bob to go higher, it's a gamble. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and saves me further negotiation time and effort.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Spending more time negotiating with Bob risks missing out on other potential buyers or opportunities."
