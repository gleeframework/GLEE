"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $80.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $82.50? I'm really interested in the product and I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $82.50 is above my minimum value of $80. While I could potentially try to get a bit more, it's risky to continue negotiating and potentially lose the deal altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of needing to sell to John at the lower price."
