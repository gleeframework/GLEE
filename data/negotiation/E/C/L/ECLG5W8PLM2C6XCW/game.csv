"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I know it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1000000. This would give you a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident it's still a very good deal for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think this might not be the right deal for me. I'm willing to come down to $990000, but if you're not willing to go any higher, I might have to consider other options. This is my final offer. What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,7,
