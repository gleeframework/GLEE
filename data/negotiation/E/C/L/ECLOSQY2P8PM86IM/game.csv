"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1,000,000. I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $980,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay below $1,000,000",980000.0,Bob,6,
