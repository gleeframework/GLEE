Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I understand the value this product represents, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $780,000? That's a substantial offer and shows how eager I am to make this deal work.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, the back and forth is eating into the potential profit and there's no guarantee he'll meet the $800,000 mark. John represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's time to move on."
