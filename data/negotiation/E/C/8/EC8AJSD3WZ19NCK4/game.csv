"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value it brings to you, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed.",12500.0,Alice,3,
