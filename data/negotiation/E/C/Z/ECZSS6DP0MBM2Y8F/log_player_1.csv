Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000, so we need to offer it below that to make it appealing.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, which is our safety net.

By offering the product at $14,500, we're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for him to perceive a potential profit if he decides to use or resell the product."
