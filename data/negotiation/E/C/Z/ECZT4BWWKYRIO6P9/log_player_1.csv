Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is less than your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation without losing too much.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** The message makes it clear that this is a good deal for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what we're hoping for.  We need to push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows us to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm able to accept.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It's a middle ground between your last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000).
* **Highlights a fair deal:** It frames the offer as a win-win situation, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintains a strong position:**  It's still above your minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
