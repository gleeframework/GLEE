"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm able to accept.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This gives you a great price while still allowing me to make a fair profit.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
