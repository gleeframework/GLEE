"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $85 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",87.5,Alice,5,
