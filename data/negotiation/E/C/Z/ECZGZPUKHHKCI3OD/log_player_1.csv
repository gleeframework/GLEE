I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm not thrilled with the initial price, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering with $18,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable compromise for Bob.  I'm keeping the price higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is  slightly lower than what John is offering, but it's still a good deal for me and I'm willing to accept it. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid further negotiations."
