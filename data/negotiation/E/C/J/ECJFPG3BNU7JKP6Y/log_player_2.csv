"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is less than what you're willing to pay, you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. You can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to lower the price further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,800. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

You should accept Alice's offer. $13,800 is a good price, considering your maximum budget is $15,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your offer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
