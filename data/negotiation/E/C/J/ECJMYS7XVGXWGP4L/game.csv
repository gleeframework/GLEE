"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is significantly below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your desired price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
