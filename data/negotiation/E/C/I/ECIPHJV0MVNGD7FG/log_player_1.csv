"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. After considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming for the best possible outcome. Let's see if we can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, Alice. I can meet you at $1,100,000, but I was thinking we could go a bit lower. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at $1,075,000.  It seems unlikely he'll go much higher. While it's a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. Let's apply a bit more pressure and see if he budges."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I feel $1,075,000 undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000, but I can't go any lower. This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. How about $1,087,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,087,500

Bob has moved closer to our price and is unlikely to go higher. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above our minimum."
