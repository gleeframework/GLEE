"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $90. How about we split the difference and settle at $97.5?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet me halfway.  However, $97.5 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $102.5, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
