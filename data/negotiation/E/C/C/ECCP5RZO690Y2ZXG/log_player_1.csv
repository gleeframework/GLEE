{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also acknowledges the product's worth to Bob, aiming to establish a foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to purchase the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'd like to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a little outside my target range. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a bit more, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit for me."
