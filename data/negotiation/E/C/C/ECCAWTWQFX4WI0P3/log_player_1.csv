Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a substantial discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a very valuable asset.  Please let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise:
    * It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
    * It's still below the product's worth to Bob, leaving him with a potential profit.
* **Message:** The message is designed to be persuasive:
    * It highlights the value of the product to Bob.
    * It emphasizes the discount offered, making it more appealing.
    * It uses a friendly tone while also conveying the importance of the decision.

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximizes profit:** The price is high enough to earn more than my minimum while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Minimizes risk:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a backup buyer in John, ensuring I won't lose money.
* **Focuses on value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, making it more likely Bob will see the deal as beneficial."
