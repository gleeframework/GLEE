"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I've done some research, and I think that's a fair price. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
