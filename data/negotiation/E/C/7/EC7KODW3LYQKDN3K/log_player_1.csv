Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to see if he's seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium."

I'm going to reduce my counteroffer again to $1,050,000. We're getting closer, and I want to keep the negotiation moving forward.  However, I'm still holding firm to my minimum price and am not willing to drop below $1,000,000 at this point."
