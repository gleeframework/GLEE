Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  By not asking for the full $15,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm only able to go up to $12000 at this point. Let me know if you're willing to work with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reason for rejection:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is still too low. It's below my minimum desired value of $10,000. 
* **Strategic next step:**  I'm choosing to reject his offer and proceed with the negotiation. I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Counteroffer potential:** By rejecting, I can now make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial proposal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by coming down from my previous $14,000 price but still staying above my minimum desired value of $10,000.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm emphasizing the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement by proposing a midpoint between our initial positions.
* **Continuing the negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the dialogue open and shows my commitment to reaching a deal."
