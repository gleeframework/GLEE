"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $13,000 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking something closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be interested in $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $9,500 is still a little steep for me. Could you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I could be persuaded to go down to $8,750, but that's as low as I can go."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
