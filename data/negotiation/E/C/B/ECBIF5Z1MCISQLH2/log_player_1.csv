{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a significant gain. It's important to present a price that is appealing to Bob but doesn't undervalue the product.
* **Open Communication:**  The message aims to engage Bob in a positive and collaborative manner, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
