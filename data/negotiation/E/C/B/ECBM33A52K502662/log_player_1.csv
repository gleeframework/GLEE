Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. It's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a win-win scenario for both of us, emphasizing the value to Bob while making the offer attractive.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a high initial offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further. If he rejects, I can always counteroffer or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows me to maintain control and potentially get closer to my desired price. I can use the next round to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, while still keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,200,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product is worth more than $1,200,000.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing a fair compromise and the value of the product. I'm also creating a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""make this deal happen.""

**Strategy:**

By offering a middle ground, I'm showing flexibility while still protecting my interests. This could lead to a quick agreement with Bob, or it could force him to reconsider his offer. If he rejects, I can then weigh my options of selling to John or making another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider my new counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of lowering my price further is too high. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower final price."
