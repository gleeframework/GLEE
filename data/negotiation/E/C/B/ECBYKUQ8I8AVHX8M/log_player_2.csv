I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $900,000. My next offer is $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I'm still not convinced that $795,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $815,000. This is the last time I'm willing to budge, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has drawn a firm line and is unlikely to go any lower.  She's signaled this is her final offer.  While we could try one more counteroffer in Round 10, it's risky.  Alice could walk away, leaving us to buy from John at the much higher price of $1,200,000.  

Accepting $815,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's price."
