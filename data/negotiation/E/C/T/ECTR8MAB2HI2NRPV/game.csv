"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is closer to its worth, I'm still looking for a figure closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're narrowing down the gap.  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
