"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $900,000 is too low, but I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This reflects the value of the product for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell for that price. I want to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still trying to work with you here, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise.  We're both very close to a deal, and I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

We're getting closer, but I'm running out of time, and I'm not sure I can get Bob to meet my minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
