"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This reflects the value of the product for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still trying to work with you here, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise.  We're both very close to a deal, and I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's get this done.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
