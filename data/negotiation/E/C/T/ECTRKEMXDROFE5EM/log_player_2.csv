"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $100? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's price:** Alice is offering the product for $100.
* **John's price:** John is selling the product for $120.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counter-offer and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it."
