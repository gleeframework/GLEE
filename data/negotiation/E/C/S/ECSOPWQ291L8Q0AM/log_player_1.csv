"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! My asking price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($100) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to engage in a discussion.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds to ensure I get the best possible deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $80.  Bob's offer is at my minimum, so I won't accept it yet.
* **Potential for a Better Price:** I believe there's potential for a higher price.  By rejecting the offer, I can try to negotiate a better deal with Bob.
* **Leveraging John:** The option to sell to John for $80 provides a safety net, but I want to explore getting a higher price if possible.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get a price closer to my initial asking price of $100 while keeping in mind Bob's willingness to pay up to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $90?  That would give us both a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** My counteroffer of $90 is halfway between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Keeping Options Open:** By offering a price higher than my minimum, I still have room to negotiate further if needed, while also maintaining a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer strategically positions me in the middle ground. It demonstrates that I'm open to negotiation but not desperate to sell at Bob's initial offer. I'll observe Bob's reaction and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and there are only 6 rounds remaining.  I don't want to risk losing out on this deal and having to sell to John for less.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:**  Even though I'm accepting the offer, it's possible that Bob might counteroffer again in a later round. If that happens, I'll assess the situation based on the remaining rounds and my confidence in getting a better price.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, I believe $85 is a reasonable price considering the limited number of rounds left. Accepting the offer ensures I secure a sale at a price that's still above my minimum, reducing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
