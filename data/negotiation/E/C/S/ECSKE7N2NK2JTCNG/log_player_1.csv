Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is still above my minimum acceptable value of $120, and it gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wishes. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new offer.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob at $100. This is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $95 is now very close to my minimum acceptable value. It's also the highest offer I've received from Bob so far. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, so I'm going to accept his offer."
