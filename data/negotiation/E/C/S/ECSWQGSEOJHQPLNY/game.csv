"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and the value I believe the product holds.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still looking to stay within my budget and am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach my minimum price to make this deal worthwhile. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
