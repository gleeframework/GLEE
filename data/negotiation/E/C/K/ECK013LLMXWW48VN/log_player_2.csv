Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to give you a small concession and sell it to you for $10,250. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation. Buying from John at $10,000 ensures you get the product without risk of further haggling and potentially missing out on both deals."
