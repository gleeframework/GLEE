Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1000000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1025000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also being fair to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1025000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is fair to both of us, considering its value to me and your profit margin. Let's close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1075000. This is a reasonable price that still allows me to earn a decent profit while being fair to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
